I saw this in the theater in '86 and fell off my chair laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... is the best damn baseball player ever." <br /> <br /> You know how it will end, but it has a great time to get there. The training scenes are very funny, but the best scene can be when Jack and Reno try to watch the Falcons game. Vikings Monday Night Football while they try a makeup dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this and it's a shame that it is overlooked as a first-rate comedy.
