"The case of the tail of the scorpion" has all the necessary elements to make an effective giallo movie. The story is standard giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) charges a life insurance policy of $ 1 million. The widow goes to Greece for payment, but a series of frightful murders follows her. There are many suspects, including a tenacious investigator (George Hilton) of the insurance agency and the lover of the widow. The director Martino keeps the story moving at a rapid pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the murderer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in "Your vice is a closed room and I only have the key" and "Who killed her?") She is an awesome-looking heroine. It is one of the best films of Martino.
