When John Singleton is on, he is * on *! And this is one of his best movies. Not as tight as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to him (and with much of the same star cast). This movie was very well written, very well placed and very well shot. There is very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (for example, where did Fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive things?) No rich history is mentioned ... And why Professor Phibbs does not mention it? Does he have an office? A teacher of his height * should * have one ... And while we're at it, for an engineering student, whether or not, Remy is a pretty dumb character. that he would have a little more in regards to basic intelligence: he speaks and acts like a total buffoon). <br /> <br /> But apart from that, the movie was very sharp. A good variety of characters and points of view; and Singleton does not take sides in history; Many of the characters do not sympathize, and he does a good job of interspersing the scenes of the Panthers and the Supremacist to show the madness of both sides. <br /> <br /> Much of The cinematography was excellent; I especially loved the scene in which Kirsty Swanson is intimately related to Taryn and Wayne, each scene was very well connected. Also the Malik / Deja scenes were also very well filmed. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was a bit too much sometimes; this movie had a tendency to preach * really * sometimes, and it also tends to hammer the points I was making over your head when the points would be so clear without the frankness (we do not really need the flag of the United States). with 'UNLEARN' written on it, give it some credit, we are not idiots ...). And to top it off, although most of the time Singleton uses melodrama quite well, sometimes it's too * too cheerful (like Deja's death, which is fine until she screams "WHY?", Which simply ruined her all Effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But the performance, in general, was the top of the line. Fabulous performances by Omar Epps (maybe the best I've seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act?), Michael Rapaport (I was really surprised ... after True Romance and Beautiful Girls, I thought it was him. single-role actor) and, of course, Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * outstanding. <br /> <br /> A disadvantage? Jennifer Connelly was flat; although it is not entirely his fault: his role was stereotyped and one-dimensional. Generic to the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who played the part, was nothing short of horrible. She moaned and moaned and moaned. Another one in the long list of models turned into actresses who failed miserably (although there are some that prove to be the exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Woohoo! An incredible soundtrack (which is definitely worth buying) that fits the film like a glove. Each scene has a twin song (although Tori Amos' songs started * really * bothering me in the end ... it's not her best work). Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... how can it go wrong? <br /> <br /> In short: a really good watch, a really strong cast, a great script, a great movie. 8/10.
