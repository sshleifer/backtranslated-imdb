While "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" chose Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified country in Latin America, this time he works for a dictator in a fictitious country in Latin America. Specifically, the dictator suddenly falls dead, so Julia replaces the president with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) who films a film in the country. From there, Dreyfuss has to discover how to be a dictator, while balancing it with his own life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" does a good job with him. No matter what you do in this movie, you do it. It only serves to show why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the best actors of our era, and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Sonia Braga (who co-starred with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first lady is sexy.
