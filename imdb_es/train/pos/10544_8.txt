Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most interesting and deceptive ideas I've seen when talking about movies. They had a single stage, a lot of actors and a plot. Then, what made him so special was the effective direction, the great dialogues and a strange condition that the characters had to treat like rats in a maze. His second film, "Cypher" (2002), had to do with his story, but it was not as good as "Cube", but here are the characters that are tested like rats again. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" It's something very interesting and makes Vincenzo go back to his "cube days", locking up the characters once again in a very different space without having to play once more with the characters , like playing with rats in an experience room. But instead of a science fiction thriller (even something similar to the wrong promotional teasers and trailers), "Nada" is a loose and light comedy that can no doubt be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world. we are living. Once again, Vicenzo surprises us with a great idea in such a small type of things. 2 actors and a dazzling white stage, that's all you have in most of the time and you do not need more than that. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" confusing, "Nothing" is completely the opposite, but at the same time also desperate. <br /> <br /> This film demonstrates once again that an intelligent idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. Of course the film fails sometimes, but its main idea means a lot and compensates for any flaws. There is nothing more to say about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that I had in the movies since "Cube".
