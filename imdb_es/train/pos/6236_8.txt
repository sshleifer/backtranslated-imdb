The intellect of the plot is almost as light as down. But the advantage here is the classic rejection of the guy and the girl we've become used to in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" is now absent. Instead of the typical accidental relationship, the dance duo are former lovers Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who are still in love since their dancing days. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a musical of the 30s, there are the problems of misunderstood romance, classy courtship and the slight irritation of a hearing sabotaged with baking soda have cost Ginger quite a bit special. And then, in the great tradition of declining finances, there is nothing better for the best Hollywood artists than to organize a show. <br /> <br /> Lovely numbers of Irving Berlin are scattered throughout the show. The top hats and the evening dresses are kept until the end, which is still a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger go out again to enchant the world ... and to enchant the navy. Once again, everyone and everything are very nice. <br /> <br /> The purest and most classic. But with Astaire and Rogers, we only know that it has to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
