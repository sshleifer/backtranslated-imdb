As I said in my comment on the first part: these two films are better than most science fiction fans confess. <br /> <br /> The scenery of the second film is not as moving as we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but after that, thousands of refugees fled in tiny space cans, protected by a single powerful spaceship. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story warms up, taking the battle to the Cylon planets. . Okay, he has a bit of Mad Max because everything they fight is the fuel for their spacecraft to travel to find the distant Earth, but it works for me. It's an exciting science fiction entertainment with excellent actors and decent special effects (although those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-)). <br /> <br /> I would have loved to continue with Starbuck and Apollo on board. Instead, we got a second sequel with no named characters that proved that the story had worked before, especially since the main characters were very well chosen ... <br /> <br /> So they passed the 1980 productions, but thumbs up for the two 1978 movies.
