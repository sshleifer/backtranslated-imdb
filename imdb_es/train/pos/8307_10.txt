The vocal performance of Tressa was exceptional !! Tressa played the role of female singer, while Richard was in the club. When he first came out on stage, and began to touch his things, he made my soul shudder. Your voice is platinum. She needs to make a CD. She has more fans than she realizes. I loved his performance in the five heartbeats, which he also starred with Leon when he was younger. How can a girl have such a big voice? It is really amazing. Good voice Good Good Good Good voice voice voice excellent fantastic voice, back tremor, tearful cry, uplifting, returns in the voice of the days. Tressa, if you read this comment, follow my advice and start recording a CD. If not only for the love of singing, but for your fans. I think you can really do it. Look at these other successful studio singers, lol.
