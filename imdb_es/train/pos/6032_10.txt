Antonioni really showed some 'cojones' when he made this movie. He went to America working under a more luxurious studio contract (MGM) and made the most damning portrait of American society I've seen. Having seen Los Angeles first hand, this is the most accurate portrait of the crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni had met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The subsequent burial by the studio is understandable, after such a huge investment and somber performance. It's sad that people do not see this movie again because I think Antonioni has proven to be right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in US politics. Everyone is much more interested in what he carries in his pockets and in the relentless expansion of living space in the inhospitable (but beautiful) desert and beyond. I would love to see how the interest in this film and a luxurious DVD release were revived. <br /> <br /> I beg people to see Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a really unique film that comments on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet, and we have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected jewel.
