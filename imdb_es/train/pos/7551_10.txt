The best animated film ever made. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely amazing effects, but also the branches of the human mind, soul and philosophy. The story has a family of cats, where the older sister dies, the younger brother sees this and rescues his body, but when she wakes up she runs out of soul. Then, the two brother cats embark on a journey to find him. I have related this trip to many things. The history of the world, the bible, the cycle of life, and every time I see it, I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not so interested in the physiological aspect of that, you will still love it. The animation is excellent, and the creative scenes will have you attached to the screen. For example, the ocean freezes over time, God eats soup from the earth, a strange and slightly SNM that retells about Hansel and Gretel. To conclude, Cat Soup is an absolute pleasure for anyone. <br /> <br /> PS- Not for children, it includes gratuitous violence.
