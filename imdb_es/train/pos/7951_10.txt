This is a very nice and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. They are two dogs and a cat that takes them to live with another person for a while, but the animals do not understand and they escape and they go to look for the family on their own. The cat is called Sassy and she lives up to her name. Chance is the youngest dog that knows a lot about life inside the pound. The shadow is the oldest and wisest dog that feels things. Put those three together on an adventure and it will be a happy and fun time. There are no special effects of mouth movement so it is not cheesy at all. It's the best talking animal movie I've seen so far. It's a really good movie for families.
