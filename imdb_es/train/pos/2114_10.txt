Two workers in a war goods store in a leather goods store turn out to be secret boyfriends, since they correspond to the aliases of the cash numbers. Within this simple idea and everyday environment, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, poignancy and irony that never ceases. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own subplots and jokes. Although mistakenly overshadowed by Stewart's great films of 39/40 (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith), this is easily on par and we enjoyed a whole range of interpretive subtleties that are not seen in the other films.
