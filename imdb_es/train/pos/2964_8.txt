['BASEketball is an extremely funny movie that offers a performance that generally makes the film much more fun, comedy material that is more than garbage in your pants, and a pretty good plot despite the fact that they are the classic bums against the evil rich man. and the only thing I did not like about BASEketball was that this child was not really necessary in the movie, but if the child was not in the movie, some of the funny scenes would not have existed. If you have read a professional review about this film, exclaim them all because most critics have not liked this movie. Baseball Baseball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 out of 10.']
