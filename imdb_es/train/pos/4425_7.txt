Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre. Successfully, and not, to different degrees. <br /> <br /> The Buddhist monk has the vision that he must kill a legendary (and very active) demon on the Gojoe bridge to achieve enlightenment. Although not in the forefront, Buddhist thought is at the heart of this film, as is the "Ran" of Kurosawa. It was probably what made the movie the most interesting for me, although now it's close to the "Ran" league. <br /> <br /> The elegant visual direction and the excellent photography make the film more interesting during the two hours and eighteen minutes of duration. The main actors are uniformly excellent. The music is very good. The two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes. The film creeps in the middle, which could have been fixed by a prudent edit. And the fight scenes are filmed mostly in blurred close-ups. This works for most of the movie, but the ending feels like a cheat. Another recent movie like this one is "Seven Swords" by Tsui Hark, a great movie, but the promised fight scenes are disappointing. Asano does not really move like a demon wielding a sword, his performance is excellent, but it would be an extra in the traditional chambara fight scene. <br /> <br /> Good movie, it's probably interesting for you, just do not do it. Expect traditional sword fights.
