I have seen many PPV in the past, but this is the most entertaining and intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. The DVD extras are worthwhile because they provide a different view of how wrestlers act after the show (such as the Chris Benoit interview / Edge interview), a look at the era of Monday Night Wars, the first Hogan game that won the title of the label. Gold and some promotional talk. In addition, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Team Table Match: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley against Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 This was a pretty good intense match to start the show. Not too many prisoners and only pure pure physicality. Spike can defend himself in table games and Guerro and Benoit gave good pure fighting skills on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusader Championship: Jamie Noble with Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd really did not care about any of the wrestlers and was not interested until Kidman made a shooting star press. Usually, people expect a lot of high flight in a cruiserweight championship, but this had very little. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, nobody cared or knew (you can tell by the lack of flash from the camera). However, the end was quick. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I've never really liked the regal as a fighter, it lacks intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but he really did not have the opportunity to boast of his high flight level, although he still made some good meters and added that he needed a fast pace for the game. He finished quickly what was perfect for this match. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's fun to watch Cena's first PPV, how he used to act, how he dressed and how he looked (see his interview, it's pretty funny). This was a good intense combination with Cena that shows a good variety of wineries, suplexes, counters and some antenna. Jericho was mediocre but he definitely helped Cena launch his career. Dinner wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE intercontenital championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good game. Both styles of wrestlers really combined well on the screen, with Brocks pure power and raw energy compared to RVD's skill and movements. RVD looked very good in this game (better than their last games with edge and dinner) and the whole game was fast. The final worked perfectly because he still retains Brock's unbeaten streak and gives RVD his fair desserts in his home state. <br /> <br /> 6. Disqualifications do not match: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid coincidence that lacked some intensity as the RVD match but still a good follow-up. Although it started a bit slow (as always with the big show), Booker T was impressive and made a sickly move at the advertisers' table. The finalizer was incredible, the end was a great dislike and a breakthrough for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance Storm 5/10 This was a mediocre game. Hogan goes out as usual to a great pop, but his variety of movements lacks intensity and energy. On the other hand, Christian does not have the best athletic skills. This ended up being a mediocre game at best, but it was still good for the PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match for the Indisputable Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle <br /> <br /> Easily the game of the year. This is by far the best triple threat combat I have seen. He had close falls, many finalists, stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. No one could predict who would come out of this. If you are going to buy this DVD, I would buy it strictly for this game. (Finishing? Look at it for yourself!) <br /> <br /> In general, this was a solid PPV with lots of extras to keep you looking over and over again. Although it's hard to find (I had to pay a little more than normal for this DVD) it's definitely worth your money.
