OK, first, ignore the last person's review. They admit to falling asleep, so it's no wonder they did not understand what was happening! As the thriller / horrors go away, this movie is not so bad, it's certainly very visible. From the first scenes, you get a general idea of ​​what will be the cause of all the madness that follows, and in the end, it shows that everything is fine. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it The movie, sometimes it was quite strange and, as old movies go, it's passable. Great to see late at night! I give a generous 7 out of 10.
