Like Ishtar and King of Comedy, other great misunderstood comedies, Envy has great interpretations of two actors who play essentially, losers (it may be too harsh a word, I'll call them low-income students). <br /> <br /> This movie was a jewel of dark comedy, and I'm not sure what people expect. I enjoy watching a great studio comedy that is not full of obvious humor, and I think the little moments in this movie are worth it. The look on Stiller's face when he sees the doo dog disappear for the first time captures a moment, a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but he examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were many great scenes (the decrepit "cottage by the lake" of the J-Man, the unceremonious burial of Corky, the role of Weitz's wife and the Walken J-Man, all great things. <br /> <br /> I can "I do not share the people who appear in IMDb and ruthless waste movies when they have no idea what it takes to make one." I will take Envy to almost any of the ten highest grossing comedies of the year (except Napoleon) Dynamite) It's more witty, weirder and an unconventional and nice gem. <br /> <br /> Remember these people, most of the time, Popular is not equal to Good.
