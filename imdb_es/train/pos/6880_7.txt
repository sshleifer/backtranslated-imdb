['You know what they say about the 70s ... if you can remember them, you were not there. One of the few things I do remember from the 70s was the first hippie and hippeya social satire seen from a totally &#39;underground&#39; or counter-cultural perspective ... The Groove Tube. If the humor seems faded or witty to some viewers, it can only be because a lot has happened in the last 30 years and the comedy is no longer &quot;fresh&quot; ... but hey! When this movie came out, it was the first ... and some of these scenes were made for the first time ... at a time when Nixon was in office, the Vietnam War was at its height, the sexual revolution was in full apogee. .and J. Edgar Hoover was still in charge of the FBI. This is a movie made before Watergate broke up and, as such, was one of the first to strike a blow at the establishment ... to make fun of her and the hippies at the same time. And, frankly, some of the parodies are still fun. If you liked Cheech and Chong&#39;s &quot;Up In Smoke&quot;, you&#39;ll love this movie. <br /><br /> If you want to know how the 70s really were ... consult the Groove Tube ... if you liked the Oscar-winning &quot;Network&quot; that same year and you thought it was right in its wild aspect on television, it will dig the Groove Tube ... which takes up the subject but plays from the angle of the spectators ... the young spectators who turned off the television in favor of other entertainment ... We were brought up in Ozzie and Harriet &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, Father Knows Best, My Three Sons ... Happy Days ... so imagine our joy when those of us who were experimenting with the new lifestyles could see a shipment from the box as seen from our perspective! The commercials of the Uranus corporation alone have no price ... &quot;Good things come from Uranus&quot; ... and the sudden break of the direct film in Fritz, the animation in the style of the cat, when the hippies eat the weeds , remains one of the best segments. And out of the sanity that I saw in the movie. <br /><br /> If you liked the Kentucky Fried movie, you will love this movie. And if you&#39;ve ever wondered why your strange Uncle Harold still has an evil glow in his eyes when he thinks about his college days ... this would be the perfect movie to watch. <br /><br /> Take it for what it is ... a reminder of the times ... and a cheeky little movie that will help all of us who forget the 70s to remember them again.']
