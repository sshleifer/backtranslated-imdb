['Look, this is possibly one of the best movies the United States has to offer to the rest of the world. To hate this movie is to hate freedom itself. I remember that the first 80&#39;s were a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. Out of that confusion came a hero, Stroker Ace. The performance of Ned Beatty in this movie proved that he would never be cast again as a one-dimensional victim in the desert. His triumph is an inspiration for all. The on-screen chemistry between Burt and Loni draws obvious comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this movie tonight!']
