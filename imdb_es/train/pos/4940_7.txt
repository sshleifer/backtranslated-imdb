This movie is about human relationships. Charming, fun and well written, with meaningful text. It seems that Morgan Freeman will surely have fun on set. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really enjoy his performance. Women like her are a good motivation to learn the Spanish language. From the moment that Morgan Freeman meets the beautiful Paz Vega, the view takes place on an intimate journey with two strangers who learn to worry about the direction of their lives. 10 Items or Less has to do with the enthusiasm of life. If you like this movie, see also The Search for Happiness with Will Smith and his son. That is not an action movie or a naked comedy. It's about human relationships.
