Part of the enjoyment I took of this film was due to the fact that I knew nothing more about it than the one starring John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to see), it was a period piece and it involved chess. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. Therefore, I will not give much more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is magnificent as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius, and Em ties him step by step like the strong-minded woman who is attracted to him. It's about love and obsession, instead of the venerated board game and after drawing me gradually for the first half hour, it became totally convincing. And I challenge anyone to question the ending.
