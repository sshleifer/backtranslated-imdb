Knight Jim is not really a boxing movie. It's a vehicle for Errol Flynn like Jim Corbett. But with that said, the boxing scenes are a true revelation for the modern viewer. There are no 12-round point decisions here. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the Irish bank employee who has a chance to win the world heavyweight title. Flynn is well adapted to the role of Corbett soft but unpredictable. His opponent John Sullivan is still better, however, an old school bruise played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is a man who is looking for his great opportunity. Corbett leaves behind his worldly life and builds a new person like Knight Jim. Jim is a chancist who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egotist. Sullivan, the heavyweight boxing champion, is depicted as a simple brute, but his honesty and sportsmanship give a certain contrast to the main character. <br /> <br /> There is action and excitement in abundance and a wonderful ending with the requirement of redemption for all. And Errol Flynn takes the girl.
