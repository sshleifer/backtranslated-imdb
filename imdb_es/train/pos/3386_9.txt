Is this the future that awaits us? An overpopulated and implacable wasteland with a hellish and unwanted existence? This film reminds us of a problem that still plagues us, doubly so since it was released in 1973. Hopefully the world does not end this way ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie that I enjoyed a lot. He had nice characters, a semi-apocalyptic environment, a convincing and stimulating plot, and the most macho man that exists: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very nasty and dirty feeling. You are almost drowned by the stench of the city and its filthy inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, is Thorn. Man created this role of tough, but nice tough guy. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is not right, but everyone around him either does not listen (more like paying not to listen) or they want him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his latest film, R.I.P.) plays the adorable old Sun, who has already had enough of this unpleasant place. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a "piece of furniture" that comes with the apartment in which he resides. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Soylent Green The factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the "firsts" (bulldozers that get rid of the people) were excellent. The polluted air from the outside looks disgusting and very unpleasant. The empty streets of the city filled with vile and putrid people are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> A final note is the end, which even now still surprised me. It's horrible, but if you think about it, it's a good idea. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: <br /> <br /> An excellent 70s science fiction movie that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uncomfortable.
