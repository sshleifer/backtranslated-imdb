['Thriller extremely tense in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest nightmare of the third world in the Brazilian urban. For the simple fact that it is easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film, it has the Mexican character &quot;Amores Perros&quot; with a character not far from Max Cady, from both Cape Fears, although this is No, No way, a movie about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay the murderer Anisio (Miklos) to his third partner (and majority shareholder) in the construction team. The murder is attributed to the city, but things start to look very bleak when the ingenious and charismatic Anisio nightmare decides that it wants to be close to the nervous partners of the crime, not only breaking through but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes. That make up Brazilian society. Anisio converts poverty into an attitude and he wants to enter. The appearance is almost totally portable, grainy, the outstanding performances in everything, especially as the first actor (and member of the classic Brazilian pop band &#39;Titãs&#39;), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and confuses the spectator with his rather funny social terror. <br /><br /> I watched the film at the Brasilia Film Festival in November 2001. Since then it has had great success in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho']
