"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've seen. I do not understand, why this movie did not get better reviews, it's fun, harmless and sweet. I saw it for the first time, when I was 11 years old, and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later, I got it on VHS :-P Until today, I've shown it to many friends and they all liked it. , but nobody knew the movie before. I think that's the problem, almost nobody knows, so almost nobody can like it ... This movie never had a real chance, it's sad, "YES" really has the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc" . . "or" Spaceballs. "Ok, enough disgust - What I really wanted to say is that, if you ever want to laugh at your head, look at it! Even if you do not get mad at that, it's worth seeing! -> Get ready to laugh, scum of the earth!
