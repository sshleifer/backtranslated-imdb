['With an impressive cinematography and a string of Kafkaesque absurdity, this film took me out of the simple and fascinating initial scene. The movie looks a lot like a dream, and I think that may be the reason why people hate or love it. The characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little useless. But these are flaws of the movie but conscious choices. The film does not try to function as a story, but rather a deconstruction of the war films of the 1940s. <br /><br /> I would have trouble arguing that the movie had a lot of substance, but the film is a cinematic marvel that completely surprised me. This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies in history, and there is a wild imagination in its style. I can fully understand why people would hate it, but I give it 9/10.']
