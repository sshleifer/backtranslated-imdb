<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of the action of the neo-Shaw Brothers and the urban cynicism of Ringo Lam. When you watch the movie, you may feel that the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature, but that does not matter, what counts is the attitude and the atmosphere. This great movie has both! Always trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam gives us the traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and puts them in an environment of "Raiders of the Lost Ark". However, these are not the cheerful comedic incarnations you can see in a Jet Li movie. Instead, these guys fight to the death with brutal results. What makes the film even better is that anyone could die at any time, there is no contention. Pity, they do not make movies like this more often.
