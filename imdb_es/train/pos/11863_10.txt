Perhaps this could be the best film ever made and, if not, is one of the people who burn the most with their students, because what Brian De Palma offers here is a great work of cinematographic art. First is the touch of the director of Brian De Palma, who proves once again that he could be one of the best directors in history, there is the magnificent performance of Al Pacino, who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana) , there are the many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (the one from the chainsaw, the one from where Tony is sitting in a bathroom that is as big as the living room of most people), there are many excellent phrases (count how often the word "f * ck" is used, there are the magnificent little details (the Pan-American globe that screams "The world is yours") or the great confusion of Giorgio Moroder. You can not name anything that is not sublime here and it is easily together with "The Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White heat" one of the best gangstermovies ever created!
