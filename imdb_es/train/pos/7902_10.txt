The film is exceptional in its gay iconography and extends this beyond aesthetics to music and to the cast. Throughout the film there is a child wonder seen through the eyes of the main character. His cheerful version of the world around us is comical and beautiful. In a way, it's a movie for girls. Look at this is that you fancy a relaxing and entertaining midnight movie. Buy this if you like the different shots of the world of media and love combined (?).
