The second official episode of the series "Columbo" ("Murder by the Book", filmed later, reached the airwaves first). Robert Culp, who would coincide with Peter Falk's detective in several future installments, is fantastic as the director of a sophisticated private detective agency that kills a client's wife when she refuses to give in to his blackmail schemes. The two stars are well paired in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series.
