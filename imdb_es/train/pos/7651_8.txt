An interesting television movie based on real events, betrayed by the description of one of the main characters, that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate mission of deciding whether to appeal to the courts for the death penalty of his brother. But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with Koteas' acting ability. It only looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to "G.Q." Magazine, with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. I realized this after having returned to meet an old friend, whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, who happened in several Panamanian prisons. The young man he used to know has left, not only because he is older, but also because of his prolonged exposure to the penal system. There are prisons and jails, it must be said, but this prisoner in "Shot In the Heart" is definitely out of this world.
