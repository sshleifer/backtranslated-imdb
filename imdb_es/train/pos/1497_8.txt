This film is a very entertaining horror anthology film (in the line of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It is very fun for terror fans and has an excellent cast. The movie should also be seen by Doctor Who fans, since Jon Pertwee (the third doctor) has a funny role as a rude and nasty horror star.
