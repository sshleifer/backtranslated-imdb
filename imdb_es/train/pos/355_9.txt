I, like many terror fans, have been forced to eat the same big banal budget Hollywood remakes and MTV high school slasher dungeons for the past 20 years. Here, finally, there is an original horror genre film that meets all the requirements. <br /> <br /> You want a leading actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, great vehicles and blood. , a lot of that, because of the load of the cube - you already have it. <br /> <br /> With an excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from Hammer Horror's own shriek queen, Stephanie Beacham, this really is something fantastic. <br /> <br /> Despite its low budget, by opting to use a 35mm stock and adding quality CG effects to the mix, director James Eaves has created something that feels much bigger. <br /> <br /> A must for the horror of old school amateurs.
