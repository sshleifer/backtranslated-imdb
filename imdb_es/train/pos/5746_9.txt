Words seriously are not enough to convey the emotional power of this movie; It is one of the most heartbreaking you will ever see, but the end is one of the most loving, tender and emotionally satisfying that you can expect. All the actors in all the roles are great, especially Jamie Lee Curtis, a wise and underestimated, a Ray Liotta with a wound and anguish, and a twist by Tom Hulce that should have had him in every prize in the book. (He is the chosen number 1 for the Best Actor of 1988 in "Oscars Alternativos" by Danny Peary). The last half hour borders the melodrama, but the movie wins each one of its tears, and unless you are made of stone, there will be many.
