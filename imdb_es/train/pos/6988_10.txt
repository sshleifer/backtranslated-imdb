This is a movie that will take time to get out of your head once you've seen it. The dialogues are almost perfect, as expected, since it was adapted from a work. The actors are simply giving their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure happiness! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is totally credible in her role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so silly) who provides so much pleasure to the eyes as to the ears, Jean-Paul Rouve is providing an excellent Approach to the total pull (and proud to be), and Marina Fois is the foolish friend who is always making mistakes when she least expects it. <br /> <br /> Thumb to Bernard Rapp and Associates to adapt this excellent work and all the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I wish there were more of these in the current production. If you liked it, you will probably also enjoy: "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and interpreted by the Bacri / Jaoui couple.
