Bad script, bad direction, about the best performances, overflowing dialogue. What more could you want? For laughs, there is simply nothing better than this. The exaggerated action of Zadora combined with the clich√© scenarios in which she finds herself becomes a hilarious parody of the "Hollywood" machine. Almost as fun as "Spinal Tap" even though it clearly was not thought of as such. Do not miss Ray Liotta's debut line, "It looks like a penis".
