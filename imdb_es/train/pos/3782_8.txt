When I was a kid, I loved Bill and Ted's movies. The other night, Bogus Journey was underway and, as I had at least 5 years since I last saw it, I decided to tune it. AND I LOVED EVERYTHING MORE AGAIN! This movie is still fun after all those years. "Excellent Adventure" is better, but this is the same. Sure, some of the performances are a little cheesy, but hey, this whole movie is pretty corny. In addition, it has the best representation of Death in a movie! Concluding: Totally as a type of non-fake film! Excellent road! STATION!!!
