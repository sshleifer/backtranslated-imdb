I love this program. Period. I have not been watching for a long time, probably only about six months or so, actually, but now it's my favorite show and probably it will be for quite some time. I love all the characters, except that I really do not care about Donna. I'm not completely sure why. I just ... I do not find it funny, and I do not think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Apart from her, the rest of the cast seems pretty good to me. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Erics' parents, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I did not completely hate the eighth season. I still see it, and it makes me laugh. But, if you compare it with the previous seasons, it's not good. Randy is horrible. The ending was decent, nothing surprising, but good. =] I think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but hey. I have the fourth season on DVD, and some day I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of his most hilarious episodes, in my opinion, were 'Dine & Dash', 'Grandmas Dead', 'Red & Stacey' and 'Streaking', but I love all the episodes I've seen so far, which is the most They, I think. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
