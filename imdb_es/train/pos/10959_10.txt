All I can say is that if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, then you're not human! Even after seeing it for the first time, I was hooked. It's a fascinating experience that's hard to describe, as I'm sure other fans will confirm it. After seeing it, you will cry at the thought that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have gray gardens to remember them! I think we all yearn for the fierce independence with which these two ladies were honored. Although I've always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she does not stay in your heart like Big and Little Edie do. How strange to try to meet such people; I wish I had had!
