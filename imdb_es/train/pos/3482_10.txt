This is my first comment on the IMDb website, and the reason I write it is because we are talking about ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL! 'Ne goryuy!' it will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not yet a fanatic) of the tradition of singing the Georgian choir, and you will possibly accept the difficulties of your own existence and you will feel good after watching. it :) What I really like about this movie is that the actors in the non-main roles create vivid and memorable characters and they are as interesting and important as the central character. The movie stars Vahtang Kikabidze (which is great), but he will remember every face around him in the movie. You will find yourself quoting your lines, which have become well-known names for many Russian-speaking people. A movie to live. Simple, but deep, you'll want to see it again and again.
