['In New York, when the shy and lonely project manager of a design firm Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) on the subway, he invites her to dinner with him. Jenny immediately falls in love with him, they have sex and reveals her true identity, telling her that she is the powerful G-Girl superhero. After meeting her co-worker and friend Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris), the needy Jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and Matt follows the advice of her best friend Vaughn Haige (Rainn Wilson) and leaves her, breaking her heart . Jenny turns Matt&#39;s life into hell, while he has an affair with Hannah. However, the archenemy of G-Girl and former high school girlfriend of Jenny, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), proposes to Matt to attract Jenny to take away his superpowers. <br /><br /> &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot; is deliciously silly and fun. This romantic-adventure comedy has many fun moments and is very entertaining. Luke Wilson is great in the role of an idiot, Anna Farris is extremely sexy as always, and Uma Thurman is excellent in the role of a crazy neurotic superhero reminiscent of Glenn Close in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; or Evelyn Draper in &quot;Play Misty For Me &quot;. My vote is seven. <br /><br /> Title (Brazil): &quot;Minha Super Ex-Namorada&quot; (&quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot;)']
