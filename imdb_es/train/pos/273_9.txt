It's hard for me to criticize everything Mitzi Kapture does. She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. However, yes, the plot was predictable. I think if Jill had slept with Richard, that could have made him a little crazier than he already was, which would have increased the suspense. It would also have been nice to see Jill and her husband find out about Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, maybe a little behind. I was a little disappointed at the end of the movie. I would have liked to have seen more closure with the death of Zack and possibly with her husband. However, I have to say that I will never be able to look at a flare gun and not imagine it standing there. It was a very fitting ending for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I am so anxious to see your future projects.
