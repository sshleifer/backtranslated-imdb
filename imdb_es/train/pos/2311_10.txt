The first movie by Reese Witherspooon. I loved. The plot and the acting was first class. You are emotionally involved with the characters. In my opinion, a must see. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you will see why Reese Witherspoon's career has been so successful. <br /> <br /> The other cast members also do a great job. <br /> <br /> The film flows extremely well. There is not a dull moment in the whole picture. The man in the length of the Moon is just. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I think this movie was excellent. I've seen it several times and I've enjoyed each of the sightings.
