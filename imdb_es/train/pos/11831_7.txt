Despite the beautiful and impressive animation, this is probably one of the most boring Disney movies I've seen, and I do not criticize Disney movies very often. The spirit is a wild stallion that is repeatedly captured, either by the cavalry or by the Indians, who try to "break it". The spirit ends up forming a link with the Indian, and that, in a few words, is history. With the exception of the beautiful animation of the horses, neither I nor my five-year-old son were very inspired or excited with this film. It is ironic that it is entitled "Spirit", since the spirit is what this film could have used a little more. An additional point was given for the soundtrack, which was nice, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And even though this movie has a G rating, you probably still have to finish explaining what it means to "break a horse" for your five-year-old son. I did. <br /> <br />
