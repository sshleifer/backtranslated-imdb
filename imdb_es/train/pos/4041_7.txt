['Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. When he survives electrocution, government officials give him the option to electrocute himself to a greater extent or accept some experiments. He chooses experimentation and is placed in a large metal cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the electrocution. They can have whatever they want in the room (within reason), but they can not leave. after a few days, the meals are reduced to one per day and the temperature of the room is also set to 100. Afterwards, some alarms are activated at intervals so that they can not sleep. One day, a &#39;witch&#39; enters her cell (even if it is a piece of glass). What happens next, I will let you know. I may be in the minority here, but I liked the accumulation, it intrigued me. Now, if the reward was half as good as the accumulation, I would have rated it much higher. <br /><br /> My Degree: C + <br /><br /> DVD Game Media Blaster&#39;s 2 Extras: Disk 1) Director&#39;s Cut; Trailers for &quot;Versus&quot;, &quot;Aragami&quot;, &quot;Attack the Gas Station&quot;, and &quot;Deadly Outlaw Rekka&quot; Disco 2) Theatrical cut; Comment with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Taku and Tsutomu Takahashi; Interview to the cast and crew; Making the original Trailer; and Promo Teasers']
