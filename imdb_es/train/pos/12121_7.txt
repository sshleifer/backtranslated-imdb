The characters of Somerset Maugham come to life in RKO's "Of Human Bondage"; but the film is a too skeletal version of the novel, with the performance of Bette Davis as a star that absorbs all the energy. Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (like Philip Carey); he dreams of being a painter, but they tell him that he has no talent for the arts. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard struggles, instead, to become a doctor. Their efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts; Despite being successful in medicine, his painting seemed easier, also, consider the symbolism of his disability, a "club foot" (explained in the film). <br /> <br /> On the way (immediately, in this version), Howard falls in love with the waitress Davis (as Mildred Rogers). Davis's characterization of "Mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech, when he tells Howard, among other things, that he had to "CLEAN MY MOUTH!" after kissing him Howard also has a good performance, but the story does not explain his prolonged fascination and love for Davis; Thus, their actions are wasted. <br /> <br /> Still, a movie to watch the performance, including some good support players. The characterization of Bette Davis was famous for inspiring a "written" campaign for the Academy Award "Best Actress" of 1934. For the record, she placed third. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It Happened One Night" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" <br /> <br /> 3. Bette Davis - "Of human fastening" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "A night of love" <br /> <br /> ******* Of human bondage (28 / 8/34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
