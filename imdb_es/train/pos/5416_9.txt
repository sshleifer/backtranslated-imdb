I only saw it once. This happened in 1952, I was seven years old, the 13th movie. <br /> <br /> We were very young ... But I always took into account the strong moments of Gunga's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I realized at that moment how much a people can be subjected and used by a foreign nation. Under these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, a type of friendship that ignores itself, that arises among people who share daily life, who look expensive, who know each other, but who belong to different worlds. , you can only make it appear. Then, in the most critical moments, a worrisome question arises: "Who are we, in the first place, we are supposed to be loyal?", What people, family, country, the person you know closest to you? You do not have time to give a perfect answer, the urgency is there, and it is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer with self-sacrifice. Somewhere, in a confused way, a problem remains unresolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the film until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities that we can see today, because this death is single disappearance. I lived life, I shared unconditional friendship with my son. It was lived by the spectator that I was. That day I loose Gunga-Din forever. As I left behind, later, my beautiful childhood, since I left so many worlds in which I lived. I left all this forever and these lines are today a brief visit that I did not expect to make this morning when I got up.
