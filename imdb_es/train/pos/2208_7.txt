College girl Joanne Murray takes on the unenviable job of preparing the student housing building to become apartments, which includes the sale of unnecessary furniture. This takes place during a break, so a mysterious psychopath is stalking the nearly empty facilities on campus. "Blood" is a low budget slasher movie that is quite entertaining. The acting is pretty bad, the plot is predictable, but the bloody effects are pretty good. The film was made by UCLA film students Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow for next to nothing. Very soon a dreamlike atmosphere begins, very similar to the enveloping woods of the fantastic "Just Before Dawn" by Jeff Leiberman .7 of 10. It is great to see Daphne Zuniga of the fame of "The Initiation" rarely executed by a car.
