The world of the Dragon Hunters is a world challenged by gravity in 3D. Planetoids, pieces of buildings and strange flat plants float around the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling in nowhere. It is a world that remembers Neverending Story, when Nothing came to eat the world. <br /> <br /> Funny enough is that the villain here is the World Gobbler. This time it's a huge skeleton dragon with burning eyes. The heroes are a big but taciturn warrior, an annoying and greedy companion who manages the business side of the duo and a strange useless animal. They are joined by the most talkative girl in the world who, to my dismay, did not die a horrible, painful and, hopefully, early death. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. The voices and sounds are first class. Pity that the story is as simple as one can imagine. They are going to stop the World Gobbler, they reach it almost immediately, they defeat it. The end. There is no development of real characters or twists of the story. Not even the ones I would expect from a movie with such an argument. <br /> <br /> In a few words: it's a nice thing to see, children probably enjoy it, but that's it. There is no depth for this world (play on words).
