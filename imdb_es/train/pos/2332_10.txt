"Imagine if you could bring things back to life with just a touch" As soon as I heard that, my attention was focused on the Trailer, and after the first episode I found myself in love with this program. A fairy tale of today that brings my spirits and catches my attention throughout the show. I think the performance and the cast are just perfect, each character brings something unique to the show that adds to its perfection. Even the only time that the villains manage to overflow with a unique sense, from the bee man to the guy who can swallow kittens, it seems they never disappoint me. And the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up being purely comical (like an Exploding Scratch & Sniff book) <br /> <br /> Even with the large number of crime programs we have today, Daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest, being not only a mystery, but a love story, a comedy and a fairy tale with a touch of drama, all cooked in a wonderful cake ..... err show. <br /> <br /> What really surprised me was the fact that I was on ABC. For years I never had a reason to turn to ABC. But this brought me back every week with a smile on my face. It was as if Pushing Daisies brought ABC back to life for me. But in this way, after two seasons, the program has been set aside A A Awards, A Large Fan Base and Positive Responses from critics. It seems that Ned has played ABC again and always killed him for me. However, I will always be a fan of this program, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to talk and love the programs they see.
