I saw this film when I was almost a child and, naturally, I was moved to tears by this story of a family of foxes. The fantastic stage in Hokkaido, the excellent narration and, finally, the wonderful soundtrack provide an exceptional intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of the beautiful soundtrack. For German viewers it may be useful to know that the DEFA dub is the only one worth listening to. I recorded both (DEFA and BR) but I still see the first one only.
