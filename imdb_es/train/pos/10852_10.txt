Hi, I was alanrickmaniac. I'm still a Crazy-holic. It was just another movie that I saw partly on television. Then I had to get the videotape to finally discover how it ends. Then I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed the first signs of deterioration after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Then in several movie posters and the script of the film. Right now it has become worse that I try to pressure other people with the addiction with my website and with the Still Crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How could that happen? What led me to the addiction? <br /> <br /> Ok, it's one of those funny comedies that are funny but somehow sad and melancholy like the one that only the British can produce. <br /> <br /> Alright, the movie is a world apart from things like '' This Is Spinal Tap '', due to the characters, who are not childish or ultra cool, but real. This is a story about aging men, too. A story about men getting along with each other. Or do not do it It contains some of the best possible actors. Tim Spall Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy, who presents one of the best performances I've seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is amazing. Foreigner's Mick Jones has written the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bassist Les Wickes and Bill Nighy as the self-centered but awkward singer Ray Simms, is really singing. We know that about Jimmy Nail, but if you only heard Bill Nighy singing in "Love Actually", you have no idea how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you'll have a fever for every scene that comes up at once, especially for the concert scenes. You would die to be able to stand in the dance crowd when Strange Fruit is doing "All Over The World", singing at the top of your lungs. You yearn to mourn and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the true Strange Fruit on the stage of the festival of Wisbech. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to the strange fruit. If there is a world where this band really exists, I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> Are you still crazy ... someone?
