I must have seen this a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen when I first saw him at B & W at the local PBS station. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD set for the children to watch, and I'm making them see it. They do not teach history at school, and this explains the most critical event of the twentieth century. Expand your critical thinking. <br /> <br /> Impartially, with participants from all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what led to the war and the real war. <br /> <br /> Buy it for your children, along with Alistair Cooke's America. Look at them, and make them understand. You will be so glad you did it.
