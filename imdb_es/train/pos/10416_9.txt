['Like Arabian Nights, this film plays with storytelling conventions to make us feel that there is a plot, a plot and more plot: it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man who tells the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback that takes us to the present of the blind, where we discover that approximately half of the story is still to come. (It must be admitted that the second half is not up to the promise of the first.) Like the Arabian Nights, try to include as many popular Middle Eastern addicts in a single work as possible. A liberated genius, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, trips by sea, a crowded market, a perverse vizier, jewels ... I do not know why everything works, but yes. Everything is so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa&#39;s score is especially beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he is being Hungarian in a Persian way.']
