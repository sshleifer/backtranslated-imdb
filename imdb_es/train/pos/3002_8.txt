"The Kennel Murder Case" starts in a race and does not stop until the end. Everyone had reasons to kill the victim, and several people tried. William Powell is fantastic as Philo Vance, gentleman detective. Mary Astor is refreshing as the niece who only wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her heritage. This movie is combined with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you have to rent the disk (or see it in your local library), do it. It's pure entertainment!
