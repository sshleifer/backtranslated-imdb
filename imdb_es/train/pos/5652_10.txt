['I love the series! Many of the stereotypes that represent southerners as hicks are very evident, but these people exist too often. The representation of the government of the South also sounds very true, but the friendly characters also remember one of the many good things about the South. Some things never change, and we see the &quot;good guys&quot; every day! There&#39;s a Lucas Buck in every southern city who just has to make a call to make things happen, and the &quot;po &#39;white trash&quot; storybook is too familiar. Apart from the supernatural elements, everything else could happen in the modern south! Somehow I think Trinity, SC, must have been in Barnwell County!']
