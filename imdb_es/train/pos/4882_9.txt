It's a fun business, review movies. These days, when "internalized emotions" and "emotional detachment" are favored over direct sentimentality, it must be difficult to stay true to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Shortly after completing the jury duties at the 58th Berlinale, I managed to capture the Kabei of Yoji Yamada. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I watched the people wander through the theater, with tearful eyes, men, women and critics. Even the director of the Berlinale, obviously an enthusiastic spectator of cinema, confessed to having been surprised and found himself crying three quarters of this sentimental experience without shame. <br /> <br /> But what really surprised me was the criticism that came later. Despite being ineffably moved by the film, many critics chose to be lukewarm and not emotionally committed in their writing. Apparently, after crying, they had put on their "thinking cap" and, consequently, they lost what I felt was Kabei's genius. <br /> <br /> Let me explain it. <br /> <br /> Set in pre-war Japan, Kabei's story revolves around a writer's family and his destiny in it, after he's in jail for what he is. described as "crimes of thought" against the imperial will. Through a series of prolonged emotional scenes, Yamada familiarizes us with the man, his loyal wife and two daughters, as well as with three secondary characters: the beautiful and young sister of the man, a former student and a cad of an uncle. ? All come to help the family cope with their difficult situation, in the absence of the man of the house. <br /> <br /> The story progresses at a slow but steady pace, and the rips occur precisely at times when everyone is capable. to predict. This, of course, makes it almost impossible for any member of the audience to feel too emotionally affected by any dramatic event. <br /> <br /> In other words, although he learns to love the family and his aides, and sympathizes with his unfortunates. However, two weeks after the movie (do not worry, Yamada gives the viewer enough information) . moments of gravity and lightness to accompany you), gives you a slap with what I can only describe as "the sting". Everything you have assumed as the story of an innocent man torn from his faithful wife and daughters. Now he suddenly points to one of the family helpers. Someone you have taken for granted now is in an unexpected twist of fate. <br /> <br /> At this point, something curious happened in the theater where I was. Everyone began to sob with little or no inhibition. <Br /> <br /> "My word!" I mumbled in a low voice. I was surprised then that "Kabei", in the final analysis, was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the brink of war. In fact, it was a shrewd examination of a common human weakness: how little we cared about the secret feelings of the people closest to us. <br /> <br /> Now, the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically sound, but lacked innovation. That's what happens when the reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap, I suppose. With Kabei, I think Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to use to play a unique aspect of humanity. An old and evil trick that he applied to perfection in the Tora-san series and, later, in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> After numbing the audience in a kind of narrative comfort zone, it throws us into a realm of emotions. rarely explored in the cinema. <br /> <br /> This, for me, is the most effective film tool of all. One that avoids detection, but it deeply affects you. And the proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex, thrown into a bin just outside that thousand-seat movie theater. <br /> <br /> Now, if only some critics resisted being so smart. Let them forget what cinema really is. Human emotions Pure and simple.
