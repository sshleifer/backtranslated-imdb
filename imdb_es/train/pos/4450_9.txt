['An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. Wander through the woods to witness a murder, but did you see the murder or are you losing your mind? Are you getting old? The film is great because the viewer has to decide what is happening. There is very little dialogue in this movie, but it does not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was happening and I liked it. <br /><br /> The other part that I liked was the forest shots in late fall and winter. Those were nice, but the only thing I did not like was the view of the old man in his underwear. I could have tied the robe a little tighter, but other than that, it was a pretty deep movie.']
