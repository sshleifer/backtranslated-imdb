I still have not seen a movie with Nolte that I did not like. However, having said that, he has made many movies and I have only seen some. In my opinion, I keep here the images of his performance and that of "The Thin Red Line". Nolte has a full range of acting talents. When it is necessary to scream, it roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are those that I treasure in the actors: when he simply emits through facial gestures, hand and body, without saying anything. Having come to the conclusion that our current generation of actors, in general, do not appreciate what an actor can do without speaking, without having a conscious appreciation of the dominance of Keaton and Chaplin, this generation of actors relies too much on the mechanical wizardry of the computers. Of course, it is also just a sign of the times in which we live. If Chaplin had lived in our times ... who knows, he could also have become a fan of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I I have not read the Vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen. However, the plot is not so complicated that we can not follow the path outlined, even with all its surprises. Of course, at first it seems absurd. However, it is not impossible either. <br /> <br /> Consider this to begin with: a spy at the heart of the Third Reich: the extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, the most important spy in the United States in World War II by Delattre and Prichard (look on Amazon for more details). Consider: Undercover Story: Piercing the Reich: American Spies Inside Nazi Germany DVD (I saw it here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be a History Channel production. <br /> <br /> So, is the story ridiculous? Far, yes, impossible, no. Back to the plot. The character of Nolte is recruited and accepts an incredibly dangerous mission and, unfortunately, the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts. Was it a kind of passivity, that he was absorbed by this role as he says because it was the best story he had written and could play the role? That is something hard to imagine that any of us would understand. But, it was an unusual moment and people did extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> The performance throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and, as people have pointed out, Alan Arkin, always fantastic, is very good in a small role. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised at the end of the movie (no, I will not spoil it) and it made me feel very bad about the choice. Did this person feel that the road was over and that he had said all that was necessary and that more chapters would be added to a life already filled with many burnt pages? It's hard to say but really startles. <br /> <br /> Nolte offers one of the best performances you can expect ... the movie's premises make you think many things. It is very entertaining and provocative. What great movies they should be. A little long but it's worth it. By the way, the music of the film has selections from one of the best living composers: Arvo Part.
