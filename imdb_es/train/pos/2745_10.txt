I have seen many movies, but 'In Cold Blood' is only in one class. It excels in all departments. The fact that it contains few large stars helps to push it over while paying more attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name on the marquee. Blake and Wilson become stellar performances of the murderous duo. The fact that much of the films are shot in the real places where the crime was committed, even inside the house, adds additional chills. Black and white photography obscures the environment and photography is magnificent. There are many outstanding cinematographic works, but if you could only vote for one to head the list, it is most likely "In Cold Blood".
