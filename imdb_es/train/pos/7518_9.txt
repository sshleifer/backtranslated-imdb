['Beautifully done with a wonderful performance by Gretchen Moll, capturing such simple happiness in her work, and the recreations of the small movies and photographs are perfectly done and often fun. According to Harron, they used films that are no longer produced and style studio lights from the fifties, even in the outer locations to give the colored parts their distinctive appearance. Bettie Page saw the movie at Hugh Heffner&#39;s house (she&#39;s now eighty-three) with the producers there, but not with the director, in case she got uncomfortable if she did not like it. Apparently, he liked it until the official investigation, which he found unsettling. Some great suits too. The idea of the film began in 1993, but it was worth waiting for. The portrait of her never seems to sound fake in reference to all those images and fragments of (terrible) films that many of us have already seen. It would be an interesting piece of accompaniment with Goodnight and Goodluck, but much more enjoyable to watch!']
