I will always have a soft spot for this Disney movie, another one of their live action / animation entries that tried to recreate the success of "Mary Poppins" and never made it. When I was in elementary school, from time to time we had a movie day, where the whole school was piled up in the cafeteria, and a movie was being projected old-fashioned, multiple reels and everything. At that time, it seemed a momentous occasion each time this day came, and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the movies I remember seeing in this way. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, it's quite charming. . Angela Lansbury never put her name on something that was not at least proficient, and she's winning here as a witch with a magic bed (boy, that could be misinterpreted, right?) That can take her and a couple of young kids on adventures magical to distant places. Come on, what child would not want a bed like that? <br /> <br /> Grade: A
