I never saw this movie and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors. In the period when this movie was made, the people in the United States were different, there was no television or all the modern things that we have today, except the radio and the beginning of the great movies that are being made in Hollywood. The sweet and innocent stories of a young romance between a girl or a boy were seen differently than they are today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet", '44 played an orphan girl whose name was Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself being taken to the home of two elderly people, who were like two wise owls and watched by Ann Shirley . It was a small city and everyone knew everyone and, if something happened, the whole city found out in a matter of minutes. It is a realistic movie with good decent people who try to help each other in a very simple way of living. Nowadays, it looks like a corn ball and stupid, but believe me, this was the way people were in the United States during the 1920s. ' & 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family movies.
