Arthur Bach needs to grow, but unfortunately it is not the only thing he needs to do. According to his extremely wealthy father, Arthur has to marry a certain wealthy Susan Johnson or the family will be cut off ($ 750 million dollars). The problem is that Arthur does not love Susan (although I've heard he makes a good chicken) and he just fell headfirst to the heels of the waitress and part-time store Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting partner. He really is just a big boy, born in wealth with at least one person taking care of him every second of every day. Working simply rubs Arthur the wrong way: he likes to have fun, be a woman and, of course, drink. Drinking gives Arthur a kind of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; And while that puts you in all kinds of problems, it's absolutely fun to see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is excellent here in this film as Arthur, earning an Oscar nomination and the Golden Globe victory for his performance. Moore is fantastic with the comic aspects of the film, turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comic gold, but it's also great to take Arthur to a relatable level and make the character pleasant. Moore has some help in the department of co-stars: Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, the lively person whom Arthur does not tire of, and John Gielgud is fantastic as Arthur's butler, Hobson. Gielgud won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in this film, and there is no question as to why. Hobson has a dry wit and a firm attitude, but he is always taking care of Arthur, and Gielgud is perfect on paper. Steve Gordon's 1981 film, Arthur, is short and simple, but offers a lot of laughter.
