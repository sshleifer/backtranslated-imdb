The first time I saw this movie on TV a few years ago, and frankly I loved it. Charles Dance is one of the most terrifying villains that anyone can imagine. His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the starkly good hero. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, but I find his irritating portrait here as the winner: a bit of "Axel Foley through the looking glass." Charlotte Lewis is, to use a trite phrase, but the only applicable, bright and beautiful. Some scenes are created wonderfully: the sequence of dreams, the bird, the fight scenes and the climatic confrontation. In spite of everything, Murphy is the modern man who suddenly fell into an oriental myth, a stunned and calmer version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy game. Like that movie, we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, though short, raise the quality even of Derek. Since 1955, Hong has defined the excellent supporting actor, the "class act" of his profession. "The golden boy" is stupid; Is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming characteristics that it is a fun and funny fantasy that is worth seeing. After four years I have seen again "The golden boy"; I enjoyed it even more! It really is very funny.
