This is very exciting! After watching "La Roue" this afternoon, a short and cheerful little film, I consider this a true delight! This is absolutely charming and one of the most charming photos I saw this year. It is the most surprising, since it is an early talkie and puts to shame some great photographs of the 30s due to its innovative use of sound in the cinema. It's just full of music and an adorable atmosphere that is really optimistic and, ultimately, it made me happy! Obviously, it would not be so difficult to recover the lottery ticket that the male protagonist was looking for, but the rhythm is so exciting and the film is so spectacularly entertaining that I did not even think twice. The comedy is often funny and I think it is even superior to the Marx Brothers, possibly the greatest comic force of the time. This is quite perfect.
