Kate Beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming Emma in this television adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read that novel, I sometimes doubted if the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story: to be honest, she is so terribly fair and intriguing that one is tempted not to love her seriously. The interpretation of Kate Beckinsale, however, saves Emma from herself, so to speak: she is represented with all the innocence and generosity of her character in sight, and one can not help but surrender and like (not to say love) to her. In spite of its less kind qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main one, but not the only one, which is why this TV series is so charming; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, expressing the personal magnetism of this character to the fullest (which is even more evident because this role was not very well handled by Ewan McGregor in the adaptation of Emma's 1996 screen ), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams are as they should be in their respective roles. This production is, in summary, a great achievement and one to see many times with greater pleasure.
