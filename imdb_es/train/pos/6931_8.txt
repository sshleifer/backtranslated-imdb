In 1955, five years after its release, James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed six other films together, four of them westerns. Their relationship was obvious from the start and what was intended to be little more than a universal programmer became a cult and a classic. Fans of the period will be delighted with the fact that the first ten names in the credits were more than well known, and that without counting Ray Teal or 'Anthony' Curtis, who would later become Tony. Maybe ten years later, the "psychological" western was well established, but in 1950 it was rare to mix Acab with Cain and Abel, not to mention addressing several other problems along the way, and still provide a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all interested parties. One to add to the DVD collection.
