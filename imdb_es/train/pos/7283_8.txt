I love buying those cheap and miserable DVDs from Alpha Video. One day, by chance I bought this one. It's the perfect silly science fiction movie of the 50s, totally sexed. Filled with EVERY little scientist, girls with little clothes and a lot of melodrama, it's a nice movie for those who appreciate this kind of stuff. And if he can "suspend his disbelief" enough, he can go mad, not only because of the psychotic head or the beating of the thing in the closet, but towards the end, with the character of "the perfect body". Is it so . . . . What is another word for the mental mind?
