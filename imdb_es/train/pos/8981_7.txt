Dig! I would tell anyone, even if you do not like Metallica to see "some kind of monster", it's a documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world that acts like mental children during a collapse. It is fun and fascinating. In the same line comes to dig! A film about 'The Dandy Warhol's' and 'the Brian Jonestown massacre', two Portland bands that start a kind of music scene in their hometown, just so one of the bands becomes a big one and one stays in the path of musical history. books. From the beginning, the two bands pull in opposite directions only in their ability to make decisions whether they are good or bad. Filmed over seven years and sometimes painful to watch, we see how the dandy's rise to fame (thanks to that announcement of vodaf√≥n!) And Jonestown's seminal fall of instigators of the scene to contenders for disputes. As gangs become more disconnected, friendships tense tense and arguments are disputed at various points and even in stage fights. All this is half fun and half tragic, believe it or not, is perversely able to see it. As I said at the beginning, you can watch the Metallica movie even if you have no interest in the band. Dig! On the other hand, it is slightly different, it is more pleasant and much easier to see if you have a passing interest in any of the bands. It's still a good movie and more a testament to not being in a band than to encourage it as a career. Dig! It is a crazy journey in the tail of the rock and roll and a good example of the traps and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous.
