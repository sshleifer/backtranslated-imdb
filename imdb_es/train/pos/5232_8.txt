This film is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy. It examines the always illusory question of "who I am" and "what am I". It is a brave and stimulating company. There are a lot of beautiful, paradoxical images inspired by dreams, similar to Escher that recall the drawing of one's own hand, or rather, the erasure of oneself. More and more we follow the writer in his agony about what to say and what to film, we see him telephoning with his wife who left for Peru, leaving him to take care of his baby, a task that he performs with less and less attention until he is so absorbed in his dilemma that he almost does not look at the child anymore. His wife returns and makes a scene, destroying his notes and helping him to go over the last stretch until he erases himself. Interspersed with images pleasing to the eye and destructive of I, the story is mainly philosophical. It is about the veils of maya, the world of illusion. The paradox of the film, however, is that you need to talk and think hard to prove that thought must stop. During the more than two hours of provocative beauty and quick philosophizing, the movie made me want a lot of silence or a shorter movie. If that was the purpose of the creator, it was quite successful.
