With a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a story that touches your heart stronger than a single rock guitarist, "Seven Pounds" surpasses the previous collaboration of the director with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a film that also loved it Remember the name of Gabriele Muccino because some of his films may go unnoticed if the actor attached to the project is not so prominent. <br /> <br /> Too bad I discovered the scheme of Will Smith from the beginning, I put two and two together when he commits suicide in the first scene and in the scene in which the character of Rosario Dawson is presented with a heart incurable. -disease <br /> <br /> However, I still think that the writer / director made the right decision when putting the bookends (the bookends are the first and the last scene) in that way, it is the source of urgency and tension in the film, gradually discovering how exactly a man can be led to that ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see how the relationship between the character of Smith and Dawson flourishes and develops, knowing in the back of his mind always what was reserved for these two unfortunate <br /> <br /> One of my friends with whom I saw the film thought that the character of Smith could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when he is in the presence of his seven chosen, however , at other times it can be severe and frightening, and when he is alone t The total weight of his situation was too much for him and he completely decomposes. It is a very versatile performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not forget to mention the recreation of the crash scene, which was really amazing in terms of cinematography combined with music. Put this on your list.
