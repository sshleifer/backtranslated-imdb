Like most other critics, I've seen this movie (on TV, never on the big screen), when I was a teenager. My father has always considered this film very well and recommended it to me then, and I must say that not only was he right, but this film has been with me for more than 2 decades since I first saw it. I've seen it two or three times since then (just a few days ago I gave it another watch) and it has not lost any of its impact over time. It's still a great movie that's worth watching! Manr considers Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY as one of the first and best later westerns, who had a realistic view of life in the old west, but the LITTLE HUNTER little known is undoubtedly the best film and was even half a dozen years before. Actually, it was probably 3 decades before its time, or maybe it still is ... <br /> <br /> Although I thought a lot and after having seen hundreds of western (I like this genre) I can not remember any western as a desolator and depressive like this. Two men united, partly out of hatred, in part for not appearing to have other options, surrounded by the beautiful Mrs. Padget, a crippled old man and a young Inian, who lead the life of murderous buffaloes until fate approaches one from them. <br /> <br /> No one who has seen this movie can forget its ending and the last frames of this gem. When the camera moves and moves away from Mr. Taylor, you see a white buffalo skin (in a tree) and the echoes of the past, when all the hate began, are present again. Mr. Taylor has his buffalo, but in the end the buffalo has it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the best performances of all those involved, the intelligent script and the great dialogue, it should also be mentioned, that THE LAST HUNT is magnificently photographed, I have rarely seen a western that shot (to a side of the ones directed by Anthony Mann, who are also all magnificently photographed), that all the places are chosen intelligently and that even the soundtrack fits very well to the image. <br /> <br /> And director BROOKS is really an excellent storyteller. . Master in crafts He has made a couple of really cool movies and succeeded in almost every genre imaginable, but even in such a prolific career, THE LAST HUNT still shines as one of his best, if not the best. br /> <br /> It would definitely deserve a higher rating, compared to the 7-something RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY.
