Hold Your Man finds Jean Harlow, a working class girl from Brooklyn who falls in love with the swindler Clark Gable and gets into all kinds of problems. The movie begins as his movie, but when it ends, the emphasis definitely changes his character. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Gable pulling a street game with his partner, Garry Owen and the brand that shouts the cops. While they chase him, Gable gets into Harlow's apartment and, since he's such a charming guy, she protects him. <br /> <br /> In a short time she is involved with him and, unfortunately, with her rackets. Gable, Harlow and Owen try to throw a badger game on a drunken Paul Hurst, but then Gable will not move on. Of course, when Hurst realizes it was a scam, he is still in pain and becomes belligerent and Gable has to punch him. But then he ends up dead outside Harlow's apartment and that platinum blond hair makes it easy to identify. She is an accomplice of homicide. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is about her and her adaptation to life in prison. His interaction with the other prisoners gives him some very good scenes. I think some of the material was used later for the classic MGM Caged. <br /> <br /> Harlow also makes the title song and is done as a torch-style ballad, very popular in those days. She talks / sings in the manner of Sophie Tucker and quite well. <br /> <br /> Gable is well chosen as the con man who develops a conscience, a part he would often play, especially in my favorite Gable movie, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> It's still Harlow who gets to shine in this movie. I think it's one of the best he did at MGM, his fans should not be missed.
