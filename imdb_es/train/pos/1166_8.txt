Tony Arzenta, an assassin of Icy and lethal ace (a divinely soft and domineering performance by Alain Delon) wants to abandon the murder business, but the dangerous mobsters he works for will not let him. After they kill his wife and son, Arzenta declares an open season for all those responsible for their deaths. The director Duccio Tessari tells the absorbing story at a constant and constant pace, maintains a proper and serious tone, organizes the exciting shootings and the thrilling car chases with a considerable snort of snorts, and punctuates the narrative with explosive explosions bloody violence. The soft and charismatic presence of Delon adds an extra class to the already fascinating procedures. This film benefits even more from the excellent performance of a cast, with laudatory contributions from Richard Conte as the wise king of the mafia Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini as Sandra Arzenta's supportive friend, Marc Porel as the loyal friend of Arzenta Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring as ruthless calculating the capo Grunwald and Lino Troisi as the poisonous gangster Rocco Cutitta. The brilliant cinematography of Silvano Ippoliti has several elegant pans. The funky score of Gianni Ferrio hits the wonderful place of descent. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in witty parts. Better yet, there is nothing to talk about and we even have a decent touch of tasty and free female nudity. The surprising conclusion contains a medium and persistent blow to the intestine. A solid and satisfying winner.
