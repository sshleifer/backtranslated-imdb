This movie is really genuine and random. It's really hard to find movies like that in a lot of movies now in Hollywood. I really enjoy watching this movie, I bought your DVD on Tuesday of this week and I've seen it 4 times. I love the Spanglish accent of Peace, it's very cute as she is. And his performance and that of Morgan are very funny and natural. <br /> <br /> My liking for the movie may be very different from the others, but I must say that I really love this movie, the simple one is the best! <br /> <br /> I learned something more about the life of this movie (well, or at least life in the US) ... life is really random ... Sometimes, you know someone, They go through your life and are your friends casually. and you do not spend a lot of time with them, maybe just a while, but you enjoy that '' time '' with them, and then you'll never meet again, but the time you're together is truly unforgettable. Just keep those moments in your mind as grateful and pleasant memories ... <br /> <br /> This film may be cheap at the manufacturing price, but its meanings are not totally cheap. I can rarely learn anything from movies, but this is an exception.
