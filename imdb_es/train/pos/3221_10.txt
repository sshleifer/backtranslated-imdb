['The movie subtly references Blade Runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact that the Cain 607 and its unit are genetic constructions, which become expendable warriors. But as my favorite quote from the movie is &quot;you should have made them smart and fast&quot;. Kurt Russell did an amazing job, his facial expressions or his lack in the movies gave more in the way of telling the story than the rest of the combined cast. Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his shuddering when given a hug, and his attachment to the young mute that in many ways reminded him of Todd himself, and what he might have been if it was not for his choice to be a soldier.']
