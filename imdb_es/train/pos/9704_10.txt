I can not believe that ten years have passed since this show first aired on television and enchanted the audience with its unique blend of comedy and horror. This is the show that gave rise to a good part of modern British humor: Dr. Terrible's House of Horribles; The dark place of Garth Marenghi; The mighty Boosh; Snuff box. Many have imitated the style of this program, and I do not deny that some have exceeded their quality. But Jermy Dyson deserves to be remembered for having started the trend, with actors Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. <br /> <br /> Together they created Royston Vasey, a small and sinister city in the idyllic countryside of England, where carefree tourists and passers-by meet an obsessive couple who want to keep the city local and free of strangers; where the unemployed are abused and insulted in the workplace; where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows; Where a veterinarian kills all the animals he tries to cure; where a gypsy circus kidnaps people; and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people. <br /> <br /> This is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in The League of Knights. By themselves, the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters. The makeup and the prostheses are so good that I actually thought that I was seeing many more actors in the program than there were. But it's also a great performance: the way they change their voices and their body movement, they really become other people. <br /> <br /> Most jokes start with something ordinary, real life, and then they become something. disturbing, sometimes heartbreaking. Sometimes it is pure horror without a configuration, as in the character of Papa Lazarou. Imagine a spooky circus owner making up someone's house and kidnapping women to be their wives. No explanation has been given. It's that creepy. Then there are the numerous references to horror films: Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, Nosferatu, The Exorcist, etc. <br /> <br /> Horror fans will love it, comedy fans will love it. As any traveler who enters, there is a sign that says 'Welcome to Royston Vasey: You will never leave'. Any spectator who gives a chance to this show will agree. Once you discover The League of Knights, you will never want anything else, you will never forget it.
