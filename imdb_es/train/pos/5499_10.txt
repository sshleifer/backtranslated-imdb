I had no idea of ​​the facts that this film presents. When I remembered this situation, I accepted the information presented in the media: a confusing event around a doubtful personality: Mr. Chávez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if something of this caliber has ever been done. I assumed that the protagonist was Mr. Chávez, but everyone who appeared in the photograph <br /> <br /> was important and, in the end, the reality of that entelechy: the people, it was overwhelming. Thanks Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
