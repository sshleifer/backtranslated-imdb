Story about four teenagers growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most sensible of the group, but she wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad children and her father hits her. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she is more mature than the rest of them. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new from what we have seen many times before, but it has a big difference: it is accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I saw the movie for the first time) and I was surprised how realistic it was. They managed to make the dialogue, the clothes and the attitudes fall quite well. Even the main song of the film ("On the Radio" by Donna Summer) was a great success before it came to light. This movie hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew girls in high school who were like that! The movie is (of course) dated, but it captures a time that we will never see again. <br /> <br /> The acting is good in all aspects, since Foster offers the best interpretation. The relationship between her and Kellerman (which was excellent) was realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) played a more or less realistic to an adolescent boy. <br /> <br /> A very good movie: essential visualization if you grew up in 1980. The movie has a deserved R rating (drug use and oath), but all teenagers should see it. I give it an 8.
