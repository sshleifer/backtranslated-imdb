Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just saw seven pounds. Nobody can make me cry like Will Smith. Man is very in tune with the wide range of human emotions. This movie was skillful and beautifully done. It is rare to find such an intense humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it with "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" in terms of the spectacle of light and dark in such a crude way. It definitely stays with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. I have a deep love and passion for films like this. It is not usually one for a "bad end", but rather a seeker of truth that embraces emotion, life in the rough and something more than the superficiality that exists in abundance around it. That's why I do not mind a bit of pain in the end. It is true to life that there are not always happy endings. Sometimes it's not the happy ending that you think it should be. Many people could live happy lives even though one's love and life were lost. If you are someone who seems a little deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
