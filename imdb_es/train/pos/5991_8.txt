A sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces in name only, The Angels Wash They Faces suffers in part from the usual scams of the Dead End Kids. In fact, with the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should have been treated as a real continuation of Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for reasons of continuity. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she is the only bright light of this movie. To paraphrase a clich√©, Ann Sheridan could read a phone book for two hours and buy me the DVD! <br /> <br /> Another virtue of this film is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo, I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
