I cried my heart, watching this movie. I have never suffered any eating disorder, but I think this must be a very true image. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohman is excellent! She expresses these feelings surprisingly well. My teenage years came back to me so vividly. Anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or teenager can relate to this movie. I recommend them all to be seen! <br /> <br /> The music is also great, now I discovered Diana Lorden. <br /> <br /> I'm also waiting to see Alison Lohman in white Oleander, because I'm sure she's perfectly prepared for the role of Agnes.
