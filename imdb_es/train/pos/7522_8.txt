"The Notorious Bettie Page" is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress, but who instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of America. Bettie Page, played by Gretchen Mol, was one of the first sexual icons in the United States. The type of model in which Bettie Page participated included nudity and slavery that led to an investigation by the US Senate. UU In the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Upon leaving the movie, all I could think about was how far we have come. Terms of pornography since the fifties. You can connect to the Internet now and find some of the most disturbing and shocking images ever filmed, that the images questioned in "The Notorious Bettie Page" seem almost childish and innocent. Most of the images, including slavery, showed no nudity when Bettie Page was involved, but today we have diseased images where we can see women who have sex with animals. It seems to me that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because seeing this movie in terms of today's pornography was done with pleasure. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was quite impressed. "The Notorious Bettie Page", I found that the movie is very well made and interesting. The movie is exactly what the trailer makes you believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sexual icons in the United States. Gretchen Mol looks like Bettie Page and offers excellent performance. I also thought that, since the film was shot in black and white, it made the film look realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a movie created in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> My Only complaint about the movie was the execution time, there seemed to be some scenes that were cut and seemed to be a bit shorter than they should have been. I looked at this and it seems that 10 minutes of the film were cut from its original presentation at the Toronto Film Festival. In addition, the ending was quite docile and I expected a little more from him or perhaps a few paragraphs on the screen to tell the audience more about the life of Bettie Page, where the movie was stopped. Those are my only two complaints about the film, besides that the direction was solid, the performance was excellent, especially Gretchen, and the writing was good. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron, who directed "American Psycho", which is One of my favorite movies is the director and writer of "The Notorious Bettie Page". I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a stage and create excellent films based on characters because, like "Psycho", Bettie Page is a study of characters and an excellent one. Harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease, as well as all the characters. She is a very talented director that I hope will last for many years. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is definitely worth it. It's a very interesting story that shows how far America has come, like the world, in terms of pornography. The film also offers an excellent interpretation of Gretchen Mol, who literally takes the role of Bettie Page in the head. And, above all, with a talented director who was able to capture the appearance of a previous era and have a good movie in your hands. Unfortunately, this movie is probably going to fail because not many, besides the people who grew up in this era, will show interest in the film, but I think it's worth checking out. <br /> <br /> The final score of MovieManMenzel for "The Notorious Bettie Page" is 8/10. It's an interesting study of characters about one of the most famous pin-up girls and sex icons in American history.
