['I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and I was completely impressed. The structure and execution of the film was fantastic ... I know not, but it really deserves an Oscar. Cal and Andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial and I can see many people who have a lot of problems with it, because it is about shooting at school and, especially, it makes you identify with the murderers. However, despite its hard and forceful theme, Zero Day is worth seeing. I&#39;m looking forward to it in video to be able to buy it, it&#39;s very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the final shot sequence leaves you speechless because it is almost too realistic. Their uncertainty, the &quot;recordings&quot;, the images and the panic of the students, totally indescribable. I really hope he gets the attention he deserves. It is done in the same format as The Blair Witch Project, a handheld camera, designed to appear as a true home video documentary, but God is INFINITELY better. Very impressive, congratulations to all involved. If you have the opportunity, you really should see it.']
