This film is as unique as the one that is overlooked ... A different story is just that, it shows how, thanks to the need to survive or maintain, one can find the capacity to love if one has an open heart and an open mind . I saw it for the first time on cable in the late 70's and it really showed the limitations of the gay community at that time. I think this film was ahead of its time in representing a small part of a dark way of life. It is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now described as the extended family. This movie must be available on DVD / VHS so that not only the extra ordinary performances of Meg Foster and Perry King can be recognized, but also to show how far we have come and still have to come to what concerns the relationship.
