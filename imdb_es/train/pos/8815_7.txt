This collection of eleven short stories in a movie is a great idea and presents some great segments, but also some disappointing surprises. On the basis of the tragic event of September 11, 2001 in the United States of America, eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the American tragedy. The result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy towards the American people, but mainly towards intolerance in the world with different cultures and people. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (United Kingdom) presents the best segment, approximately on September 11, 1973 in Chile, when the democratic government of Salvador Alliende was destroyed by the dictator Augusto Pinochet with the support of the United States . <br /> <br /> The other excellent segments are that of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), showing the intolerance in the world and the number of victims of the governments of the United States in different countries throughout the contemporary history; and that of Mira Nair (India), which shows a real story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family, whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the United States, when in reality he was a hero. <br /> <br /> Some segments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent Afghan refugee children preparing a harmless shelter against bombs, while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world; the romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a couple in New York near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia-Herzegovina) shows the effects of his war in a small place and the solitary protest of the widows; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life goes on; and the story of Shohei Imamura is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no Holy War but sadness and misfortune. <br /> <br /> The Idrissa Quedraogo segment (Birkina Faso) is very naive, but it shows the terrible poverty conditions of this African nation. <br /> <br /> The segment of Amos Gital (Israel) is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing, horrible, without inspiration and without a doubt the worst. <br /> <br /> My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("September 11")
