"Purple Rain" has never been a critic's favorite, but it's a cult classic, and it deserves to be. If you are a fan of Prince, this is for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot is that Prince sees his parents abusive in himself and falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is touching. Sometimes it is removed, but when it works, it really works. Very unpredictable. <br /> <br /> No one can really act in the movie. Everyone is on Prince's side, like "The Time" and "Vanity 6." Still, it adds charm to the movie. When Prince is ever on the screen, he turns it on and it's fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, go and see this if you love Prince like me. If you are not a fan, it will make you one.
