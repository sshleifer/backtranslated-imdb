Nice idea ... the seller Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a small county of Lampidorra. That country, which was not even in North America, became the 49th state ... (of course, there were only 48 states at that time, since this was done in 1952 ...) Linda travels to the country that have. inherited, and we follow it while trying to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even more extravagant people. At one point, she sings a song that she says is from her people, the Navajo, and she gets increasingly stupid from there ... although the heavy lipstick and the omnipresent smile of Yolande Donlan are never altered. There are other songs scattered everywhere as citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of Technicolor, or something similar, about the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as the British subject Tony Craig, a cheese seller. Bogarde made a big splash in the UK film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by QE II. Craig and "the new princess" continue to collide with each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as Lampidorra's financial problems get worse ... Little farce fun ... in line with the Marx Brothers movie. Also keep in mind that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our little project, and stayed married for 50 years! Guest was best known for writing and directing his science fiction films, both in the United Kingdom and in the United States.
