Without a doubt, Beat Street is the best movie about the breakin scene. Everything about this is perfect, the clothes (puma), the music and, most importantly, the dance. History is basic, but what about telling a story? The objective of the film is to show what the children of that moment were doing, what mattered to them. Shows that adolescents in general are good, the only thing that mattered to these children every day was music, dance and friendship. Having seen the DVD recently, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it had withstood the test of time! The clothes did not seem outdated (possibly because Puma is now having a massive comeback), the music still sounds fresh and the dance is still captivating to watch. A film that anyone 10 to 25 years of age should see as part of their youth culture.
