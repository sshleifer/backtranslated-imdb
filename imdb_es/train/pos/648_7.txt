I decided to see this because of the recommendations on this site. I should say it was worth the effort. However, you must bear in mind that this movie will last 210 minutes. If you do not have the power of permanence, put it on a tape and watch it for a couple of nights. <br /> <br /> Now to the movie, what I say will contain "spoilers" and, if not, mind, here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo. Live with an older woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and deals with Alex Alex spends his days in cafes and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had previously impregnated Gilberte with whom he used to live. Gilberte left him for a less attractive man that she did not love because Alex had mistreated and mistreated her. At this point, Alex was willing to get a job and help raise his son before discovering that Gilberte had aborted him and was planning to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By chance, Alexandre meets a nymph nurse named Veronika and they established a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika fight for Alex's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot. Finally, in the end, it is revealed that Veronika is pregnant with Alex's son and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume (as mentioned earlier with Gilberte's situation) that Alexandre will even get a job and will be the provider of his new love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title of "La Maman et la putain", I deduce that Jean Eustache was related to the character of Veronika, by Françoise Lebrun. She was a whore and then she became the mother. Therefore, the mother and the whore is the same person? Anyway, what do I know! French films are mostly (not all) very talkative, without political direction, predicative, theatrical, insipid, regrettable and full of quotes. Lebrun and Léaud interpreted their obstinate characters well and kept the film together, since part of the script was lost and separated. <br /> <br /> It is not a bad effort. 7/10.
