* WARNING * Spoilers ahead ... The writers of this story knew these men very well. The actors, too, portrayed them very well. The result is that at the end of the film you feel that you are really watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The expected tensions are there, especially in the first uncomfortable moments. But as the two begin to slacken, the old camaraderie that made the Beatles work so well begins to show. The bitterness is still there, and interrupts sometimes, but when John has the idea of ​​accepting Lorne Michaels in his offer to pay the Beatles the sum of $ 3000 to appear on "Saturday Night Live", the two could be the ones the same childhood pranksters who terrorized Liverpool together when they were teenagers, and survived by playing Hamburg's nightclubs to become Superstardom. But in the end, this wonderful fantasy gently groomes us. We are reminded why a meeting of the Beatles was probably never possible, even before Lennon's assassination: the two driving forces of the group overcame each other.
