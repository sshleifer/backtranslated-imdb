I, like many die-hard Trekkers (or Trekkies, I do not care!) Suffered seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager", dreaming of a better show when it ended, lamenting the end of "Deep Space Nine" in 1999. Prayers, answered. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, surprising new visuals, a pop song for the introduction. (I was surprised!) I can not think of anything that I did not like. Enroll me for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager", nobody misses you! Stay on Trekkin! <br /> <br />>
