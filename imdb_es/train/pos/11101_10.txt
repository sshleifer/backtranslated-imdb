The sopranos was probably the last best show that aired in the 90s. It's sad that it's over, it was the best show on HBO, if not on TV, not everything was explained to you, in everything you had to think, It was brilliant. The cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and played his excellent character, as well as others. Each character had flaws, that was what made them so real and allowed viewers to connect with them, and that is one reason why it lasted so long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to take it. The final id can interpret many different things, like thinking that Tony did not die, but Prado came in and sat with them and that the blackout was only for suspense. Tony will have to go to court and deal with that, I hope he's not dead, that's how I feel ... Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
