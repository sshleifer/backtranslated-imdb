Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man hitchhiking thousands of miles to visit his absent millionaire father (the creepy Ray Wise) on an extensive ranch, which runs on a windmill and ends up entangled in his young man's dangerous network, intriguing and seductive stepmother of hell. (the delicious Clare Wren), thus causing problems for the family that no longer works. An avant-garde, elegant and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable TV, where I saw it for the first time. It is beautifully written, behaves with elegance and is directed precisely from a script that keeps biting his nails. I can not believe that critics who did not like it have never seen it. It is a classic to discover.
