Full House was and still is a great show. It is a good show for people of all ages and it is also a good family show. There really are no programs like this anymore. The children are very cute and, although it is a little cheesy, it is still good, especially for everyone who saw it when they were children. I would love to see the cast interviewed now. Anyone who wants to see cast interviews, such as a place where they are writing things for the special features of the DVD, should go to the Petition spot website and sign a petition entitled Full House Reunion on DVD, as there is a request for this with the Hope that the cast wants to do it. Yay for Full House!
