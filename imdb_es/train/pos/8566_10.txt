I really liked the 101 Dalmations when it was published in 1996, now, 5 years later, I went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, I thought it was fantastic but I think 101 is better because I think it's more fun, more humor, and also that movie . based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred and Dalmatians (1961) I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmatians.) I hope there is, maybe yes, maybe not, all the Dalmatian fans will have to discover it. If there will be 103 dalmations in the future.
