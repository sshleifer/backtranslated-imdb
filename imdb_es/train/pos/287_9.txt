We loved the movie. I am the mother of two little men. I love having a movie that I can watch with them where men have integrity and character. Moveis where money is not the most important thing. And families are forever and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I wish we saw more of the Davis family. But above all, I loved it, it left me with the same feeling as the others "please, do not stop". We both want the actors not to change. Although the new actors were a good replacement. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son also liked this movie. He asked me to go buy them all. He is a film critic, so I say that this tells me something. The family should see this movement, buy it for friends. It helps to recover a time of values. We will be reading the books now that we are hooked. I really hope to see more. Blessed happy moving
