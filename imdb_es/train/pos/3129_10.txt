This is one of the best reunion specials of all time, with Adam West and Burt Ward parodying and having fun while they do it. It's amazing how much effort was put into the details, particularly the recovery of the 1960s, the Batcave setting, Wayne Manor, the costumes and the actors selected to play the younger versions of West, Ward , Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero. , and Frank Gorshin! These 90 minutes are worth it, and it is a delight for all fans of the classic "Batman" television series of the 1960s. I note that the "Batman" clips were from the movie, and not the series, probably due to legal restrictions. Hopefully, the three seasons of the series will be released on DVD.
