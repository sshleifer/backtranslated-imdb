This is an excellent example of what can be done in a low budget movie. The performance is excellent considering the script and the whole atmosphere of the film is very premonitory. The blood is well made and used sparingly (look for the excellent death of barbed wire) and the action is sharp when used. It is true that sometimes there are dubious lines in the script, but compared to other movies with the same budget (or bigger!), Almost does not notice. In general, this is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it looks! 8/10
