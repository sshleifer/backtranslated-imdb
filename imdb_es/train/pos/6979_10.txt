This is a real drama based on characters and stories at a level that embarrasses most of what we see on television per month. <br /> <br /> It impressed me from the beginning. Do not be discouraged if you are not a science fiction fan (like me ...) This could be happening on Earth, the fact that it is in another galaxy makes the show more interesting. there are no spaceships or laser guns (none yet, anyway) So far I have seen until s01 e04 and I am stuck and I wonder what will happen next, since there are many possibilities. <br /> <br /> The actors of the cast play there with passion. Eric Stoltz is especially strong. <br /> <br /> This program really works well only, it does not matter if you saw BSG or not, in fact they are quite different. I have read some negative reviews of science fiction geeks who expected less drama and more extraterrestrials and lightning guns, etc. but I would say do not listen to them. <br /> <br /> This is a really positive start for a show. Hopefully they will not do it after 1 or 2 seasons as they usually do with good shows these days.
