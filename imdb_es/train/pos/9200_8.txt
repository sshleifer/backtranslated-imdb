['I have read countless publications about how this game is very similar to Max Payne, when I played it the first time, I thought it was a bit strange arcade game with the desire to cheat Max Payne style (not just a bullet - now) . So when I played it for a couple of hours I realized how much fun it is! and how different from &quot;Max Payne&quot;, yes, the bullet time is a bit similar, but I think it fits differently to the style of the game. This game is an uninterrupted action: a mix between an action game and a fighting game, very funny. As a Max Payne fan, I must say that the story of DTR is not close to Max&#39;s greatness. Payne, the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a little more of that &quot;bullet time&quot; you should definitely have this game.']
