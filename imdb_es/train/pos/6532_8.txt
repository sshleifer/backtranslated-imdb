I think part of the reason why this movie was made ... and it's aimed at us, the players that really play all the Nancy Drew PC games. Lately there are many movies based on videogames, and I think in one of them. <br /> <br /> So this movie does not follow any book. But it does follow parts of the games. I buy and play all Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And the games are HerInteractive and are for "girls who do not fear a mouse". And some of these games actually won the Parents' Choice gold awards. Not only are they fun, you can also learn a thing or two while playing. <br /> <br /> I took two of my stepsons to see them and they loved it! The 10 years The old man had started playing his first Nancy Drew game a day before he took her to see the movie, and he was having so much fun playing that I thought he would also enjoy the movie. And she was right ... she not only loved this movie but could not wait to get home to finish her first game and start another. <br /> <br /> My other stepdaughter is only 7 years old and she also loved the movie, but she is still too young to play the games, but she likes to watch her sister play alone to see what is happening. <br /> <br /> The games are for children 10 years and older. All games usually receive quite nice reviews and are classified as adventure games. To learn more about the games, check out the HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So I personally thought that the movie was pretty good and I'll buy it when it comes out on DVD.
