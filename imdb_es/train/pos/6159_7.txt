This place in England during 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). She does not want them, but reluctantly accepts them. It seems that she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft. (Okay, I realize this is a family movie, but, College of Witchcraft? Come on!) Before I can finish the course, even though the university is closed due to the war (???) and she is looking for Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And she and the children travel in a bed with the help of a magic bed knob. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time when I was 9 years old and I vaguely remember that I loved it. Surely it does not hold up like an adult! The story is silly (even for a fantasy), children are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly unpleasant. Also Roddy McDowall is the third billed and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to Naboombu Island that is run by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is bad (for Disney) and it has a very violent and too long game between the animals. There are some graces that save here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; The songs (although forgettable) are pleasant; The long dance sequence at Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy, and the Oscar-winning special effects are still quite impressive at the end. But the weak storyline, the bad animation and the nasty kids really take down this one. I heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give this a 7.
