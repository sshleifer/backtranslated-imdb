I am a big fan of most of the movies that have been based on the books of Stephen King, this is one of the most terrifying and memorable. <br /> <br /> I just came back to see him for a tenth. time and I still find it moving and scary. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Gage is on a safe collision course with the monster truck is the one that stands out. And the "Not Fair" uttered by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
