The Running Man is one of those movies that, if watched, would become boring and depressing. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see her maybe once or twice a year with a couple of classmates and some drinks. <br /> <br /> In the current climate of domination of television media and the capitalist mode in society, it really functions as a revisionist social commentary, after the boom of the eighties. But forget that! There are other bright and better reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger is in top form as Ben "The Bakersfield Butcher" Richards, and the inclusion of Bond One Belting was completely inspired. The truth is that the design of the bullies is authentically American, and reflects the characterizations that are seen in the TV show "Gladiators" of the PC. , and WWE too. The spooky finale of Buzz-saw will chill any viewer to the core (as a footnote, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is apparently an optimistic activist with a bitter sense of humor?) <br /> <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are great as muscular supporters (and they're Arnies shoots in real life), and they even have Mick Fleetwood in him too! What more can you ask? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Running Man if you are looking for a great piece of entertainment, with a brilliant finish and some great characters. Just do not expect an education from him (at least in the value of the surface). <br /> <br /> Quality, I really love it. You will also do it unless you are an actor. 7/10
