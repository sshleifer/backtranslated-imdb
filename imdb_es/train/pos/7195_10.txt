I loved this republican series of output! The story was one of the best I've seen! Even difficult, the quality of the image was not the best, but it was fine. The enclosure in this series is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They should only have practiced a little more. As I said the story is great! You are sitting there and waiting to discover who is Don Del Oro! The theme song is excellent! It's the same guy who maid the music for Fox's version of Walt Disney, who maid the music of Fightin Legion. Suits and buildings are very good. Zorro is really great and so are the legioners! I recommend this series. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! It's fun, smart and brave! Brand: 6
