A linear path within a non-linear structure. It is a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows in this coming and going between the present, the future and the past. However, the linearity of the film can not be avoided: it is the work of the projector, the development of the narrative. <br /> <br /> What we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. . The world of this film by Terry Gilliam is a world with little space for free will. <br /> <br /> From the beginning we learned about the prophecy of a schizophrenic, according to which a plague would rule the Earth in 1997. Forcing the few survivors to live underground: the only place that is not affected by the virus. <br /> <br /> The mission of Cole (Willis) is clear: to return in the mid-90s to investigate what is and who is related to the release of the virus. There is no way to change the past: all that can be done is to gather information that can help present-day scientists (who, for us viewers, is the future) to find a cure. Do not change what happened (the past is inevitable), but improve the present. <br /> <br /> In his "returns" in time, Cole gradually approaches a surprising dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present. <br /> <br /> The latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who choose "volunteers" (this word is incisively ironic) to embark on journeys into the past. <br /> <br /> Scientists have not yet reached the highest level of travel time achievements, and Cole ends up on the wrong dates; this, later in the plan, will work as a test of his sanity for the psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe). <br /> <br /> We can see, through the evolution of history, that linearity and non-linearity are intertwined in a circular temporality. <br /> <br /> There is more than one moment in which the scene is the first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the weather - appears. He modifies himself, according to the evocation of Cole's memories, which arise in his dreams. <br /> <br /> At an airport, a man is shot to death while running, armed, towards another person. A blond woman runs after the murdered. <br /> <br /> This is the scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a child who visits the airport with his parents), the present (the moment of narration) and the future (adult Cole) A Throughout the narrative, Cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now. His prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The agents who shoot him prevent him from killing the mad scientist, Dr. Peters (Morse), who is responsible for the spread of the disease. <br /> <br /> What can not be changed. And, in the case of Cole, what it was is what it will be. Eternally. <br /> <br /> A film not very well understood for many. For me, nothing less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Other good films with a similar theme: The trilogy of Back to the Future (which has another angle with respect to the character of the "mad scientist", and although it shares the atmosphere of decadence - particularly in the second film -, is much more optimistic than the work of Gilliam, which is a strange image of Hollywood). <br /> <br /> In another record, there are "wild strawberries", one of Bergman's masterpieces, that involves a surprising and enlightening journey into the past through dreams and reminiscences. <br /> <br /> I have never seen "La Jet√©e", but only because I can not find it.
