We rented the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing that I went to find a used copy and bought it for myself. Now, when all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I give them Sasquatch Hunters. It is necessary to say it, although there is a rule that made the film much better. Speaking while the movie is on is not allowed unless the words are Sasquatch repeated in a song. I loved the credit at the end of the movie too. "Thanks for the Jeep, Tom!" Whoever Tom is, I say thank you because without your Jeep the movie could not have been made. In short, a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie, maybe you're looking for something else, but if you do not mind laughing at the expense of a man in a monkey suit, make yourself a copy.
