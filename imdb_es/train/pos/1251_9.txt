This documentary explores a story covered in Pilger's latest book "Freedom Next Time," which was published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> The islanders are technically British citizens, since Diego Garcia is a British colony, like Mauritius, the island near where the natives exiled, used to be. But the British government has ignored its requests to return to its country of origin, since the island is now a military base for the United States Army, which has used it as a base for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilger's coverage is shocking, especially when documenting the treatment and current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews in all aspects are excellent, and his corralling of a representative of Parliament in which he uses government information to identify him, is one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to analyze a series of recently published documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the natives. The weaving of these images with the interviews and the music of the islanders really enhances the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to see, but "Stealing a Nation" is the best of John Pilger. Recommended.
