Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins shook the world of the Christian subculture (and won millions in the process) with the books LEFT BEHIND, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of the Billy Graham evangelist association, They gave us this masterpiece. What I like most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail, sitting in a living room. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "after the rapture" tribulation, we sit in the living room, listening to them on the news because the filmmakers can not afford to show them. The premise of the film is based on pre-Millennial eschatology, before the tribulation, believing that Christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church, and then reappears at the end of the seven years of hell on earth . What used to terrify me in high school now makes me laugh. Patty's intriguing adventures and journey through the tribulation (and two of the three sequels to the film) tell of her extraordinary story of disbelief and, ultimately, of condemnation. I hate to admit it, but I still enjoy watching this. It even has the SAME exact score of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history who makes that observation.
