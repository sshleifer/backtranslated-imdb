['I&#39;m just kidding about the weight loss thing; Well, you can lose weight you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. He has the same sense of youth and innocence found in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake&#39;s Closet illustrates the beauty of the simple things in life and how often we overlook them. The film reminds us of what it is like to see the world through the eyes of children and all the magic, mystery and horror they perceive. Jake&#39;s Closet presents a tale only human in its compassion with which anyone who has had a childhood can relate and fall in love. Watch it with your friends; Look with your loved ones; Build a fort - optional wine.']
