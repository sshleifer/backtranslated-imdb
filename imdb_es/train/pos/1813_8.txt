In my case I liked this movie because when I saw it I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about their subjects even long after I finished. Talk about death, revenge and hell in such a way that it hits you like a punch in the face, even coming to suffer with the dream sequence in the middle point of the movie. That is what makes this film so good: the ability, unique in Don Bluth (director), to play with the feelings of people and make them love or hate a character in no time. That, and the fact that he has so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, that in the sad but happy ending you have to say "I have something in my eye" to hide from the others that you cried. Everything I have said are just some of the positive points of this film. As for the rest, you have to see them for yourself in an extremely honest movie. Don Bluth, thank you.
