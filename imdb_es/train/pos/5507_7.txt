I would not be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to prevent Cuba before the revolution from being as graphically corrupt as it was. The mere fact of reciting some statistics will not do it with younger people. However, the first part, which is shot almost entirely in the jungle, captures the sensation of that place, especially when crossing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a great job, against all odds. It is clear that Soderbergh does not despise these people, but it is also clear that he will not declare his case to the "Yankees" far removed from the recent past. Some of the most important historical aspects contradict what I have read. As far as I know, Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to obtain the acceptance of the United States were exhausted. But in other respects he is right, especially in regard to looting by expatriates, since the island was controlled by other rebels. The treasury of the country was empty.
