Personally, I thought that the movie was quite good, very good performance of Tadanobu Asano of Ichi the Killer fame. I can not really say much about the story, but there were parts that got me too confused, and overall I thought the movie was too long. However, apart from that, the film contained excellent great fighting performances and many of the venues were very well filmed, great effects and a lot of sword. Another solid effort from Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well, I really can not say anything else about the film, but if you only have a perspective of Asian cinema is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers, I suggest you try to rent it, but if you're dead. I would say that this has to be in your collection very good Japanese movie.
