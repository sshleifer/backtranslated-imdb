Rain or shine outside, enter a movie theater. It makes you happy (If not, leave right away.) The lights go out. It is established with an ice cream bar. Moving images begin to flash on the screen. You feel happy In the darkness, you are back at the beginning of time. Sitting around the campfire ... looking at the modern version of the flickering flames 24 times a second and sharing the joy of discovering the twists and turns unknown on stage with the rest of his clan / spectators. <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy with themselves, should not write comments. (They live romantic comedies ...)
