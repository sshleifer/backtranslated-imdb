Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a complete puzzle movie. It has all the pieces of acting, direction, argument and entertainment value. They all fit together and, when they finish, create a masterpiece, Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This film follows a single mother, Fay Grim, who tries to raise her son so that he will not grow up and be his father, who fled the law. and disappeared. Soon, the CIA contacts Fay in a desperate search to find 8 magazines from her husband Henry. These magazines were full of confessions of his past in the CIA and his participation in the countries and his governmental activities. Fay is sent to look for these newspapers, in exchange for freeing her brother from prison, and is sent in a chase by the cat and mouse throughout Europe to retrieve these journals and find out about the hidden secrets of their past husbands that she never knew. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey had already been an actress that I liked after seeing her at The OH in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought vitality to these two comedic roles from her, but Fay Grim was a very different role from the other two films. Posey made me believe what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I encouraged her and I wanted to know more. She catches you while she is on the screen and when she is away, you can not stop thinking about what is happening to her. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other previous work by writer / director Hal Hartley, but I think I'll see some of his previous films if they're half as good as Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to choose a smart movie the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD that I highly recommend you choose Fay Grim. If you have any common sense about what a movie should be like, you will enjoy this immense movie.
