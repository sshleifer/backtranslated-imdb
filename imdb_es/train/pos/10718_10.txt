Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and it also inspires others. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent and my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson in Cabaret years later because of her performance in the film. It is unfortunate that the Challenger accident has delayed and damaged the film. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident is approaching. I met one of the Challenger Astronauts from time to time in my childhood on the Carnegie Mellon campus where my father went to school; I also know a close friend of the deceased pilot. <br /> <br /> Last year I was the technical revision of the National BSA for the Boy Scouts astronomy merit badge and I still find Spacecamp a great movie to recommend to the Scouts to make the related Merit Badges with the space that I teach. <br /> <br /> I met the last astronaut again as an adult and followed an engineering education program that we had prepared when the Challenger exploded. I ended up sitting with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible", reviewing things after the Accident at the shareholders meeting of Astrotech by chance, so I am much closer to the Accident and any cinematic similarity. I made sure he was a good student and finished the degree four years later, oddly enough, on the recommendation of the Rockwell engineer who told them not to fly the Challenger in 1986 and who later built Endeavor.
