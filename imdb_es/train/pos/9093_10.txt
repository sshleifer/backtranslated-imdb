I am the father of a child with special needs and I enjoyed the movie a lot. It was loving, warm and fun. I learned a long time ago to see humor in things. Especially I thought it was sweet how all the other characters cared about Frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died. I attended a screening of the film with other parents and siblings of children with special needs before the film was edited. Everyone enjoyed the movie and actually inspired wonderful discussions. We talk about how our children make us laugh and we also talk about how we care about them. The scriptwriter talked about how she works with autistic children and other children with special needs as a volunteer for several years. She based the character on a real person. Our family has been blessed with a sense of humor that has led us through some very stressful times. I give the movie two thumbs up !!!
