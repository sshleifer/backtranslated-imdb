['Director Brian Yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre, creating masterpieces such as &quot;Return of the Living Dead 3&quot; or &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot;, but at the same time he has made horrible movies like &quot;Faust: Love for the condemned &quot;or the mediocre&quot; Progenie &quot;. Obviously, he is better in the position of Producer, where his work in the production of Stuart Gordon&#39;s films has been excellent. <br /><br /> &quot;The Dentist&quot; is one of his minor works as a director, but the low profile that benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very pleasant experience. Tells the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone (played superbly by Corbin Bernsen), a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) has an affair. with the boy from the pool. This event disturbs his mind and puts him in a wave of murders while he avenges the world for being so &quot;dirty&quot;. <br /><br /> The premise is very well handled by Yuzna, as it takes us on a walk after Feinstone&#39;s revenge day. What makes this film different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim&#39;s perspective, we follow Feinstone because he is the main character. We are witnesses of how he goes from being a respected professional to a psychological murderer in a day. Yuzna manages to give the film the exact amount of suspense, but adds a good dose of black humor that really helps the film. <br /><br /> Most of the success of the premise is in the performance of Bernsen as Feinstone. It can make you feel sympathy and hatred towards him at the same time, and the subtle humor that your character has is another aspect that helps the movie. The rest of the cast is not that good, and I think their misinterpretation hurts the movie more than it should. A notable exception is Ken Foree, like the detective who tries to catch Feinstone. While her part is quite small, she does a great job with it. <br /><br /> With a dentist as a killer, bloody scenes are expected, and Brian Yuzna offers an excellent SFX in the right amount. It&#39;s good to see that he does not exaggerate with him as he usually does, and I dare say that this is the highlight of the movie. It has the exact amount of blood expected, nothing less and nothing more. Yuzna restrained herself from her common excesses and the result is great. <br /><br /> While this is not one of Yuzna&#39;s best-known films, I&#39;d say it&#39;s one of the best. Sure, it&#39;s not classic material like its masterpieces, but it&#39;s a movie that entertains and never gets boring or boring. It&#39;s a simple movie with a low budget, but for what it is, I think it moved. 7/10']
