I think a lot of people wrote it as another of Tom Cruise's strange films (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut) but Vanilla Sky is definitely his own movie. Many people said it was weird; It was not different and confusing but not strange. Rare is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is the Truman show. Confusing is the matrix or the game. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. Everything makes sense, maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That is the point. That's where the so-called "rarity" came in that drove the critics away. If they had bothered to "open [their] eyes" like the original Spanish movie of 1997, they would have seen that. And if that is not enough reason to see it, go see it for the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to establish the "feeling", that notorious element that many films lack. With songs like "Good Vibrations" by The Beach Boys playing in the dramatic and emotional climax of the film, it creates an extravagant, but surprisingly "correct" feeling. A wonderful movie, in his script, music, acting and images, Vanilla Sky is, unfortunately, a superficial film that critics criticize to seem intelligent. Excellent: A +
