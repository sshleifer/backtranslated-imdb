['Frankly I do not understand why this movie has been a great &quot;failure&quot; in advertising. Sharon Stone has certainly not lost any of her charisma and &quot;touch&quot; from &quot;basic instinct&quot;. I voted this movie 10 and I tell you why: the game opens in London this time. London is the city to which Catherine Tramell has moved since the events in BI1. Once again, she proves to be an intellectual manipulator of her own class. She is &quot;screwing your brain&quot; like Catherine with such skill that in the end you&#39;re not quite sure who the real villain is. <br /><br /> As for the technical part of the film: the only real setback is the team of category B actors Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas, etc. in the first part. I also think that BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone had been a little younger, but he is still quite impressive in his appearance and has only improved with respect to his charisma. His &quot;assistants&quot; of B-rate are not so bad either, although he would have wanted some more important names for the cast. <br /><br /> I think there are pretty good improvements in the basic plot. I think this is a much better thriller than the garbage that Hollywood distributes so easily these days. The plot is great, it&#39;s easy to see technically, do not snore in the middle of the movie and, most importantly, the heat is on.']
