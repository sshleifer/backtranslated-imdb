As an adult over 40, I'm not even close to any of the key demographics of "Nancy Drew," but I was pleasantly surprised by the movie this afternoon; so, I might say, they were the pair of sixty silver-haired women in the row of me. The older man who left the theater right in front of me specifically praised the film to the 20-year-old female actress (who said she had seen the movie the night before and liked it a lot). <br /> <br /> More to the point, though: in the row right in front of me, there were nine, count them, nine, ten ten-year-old girls lined up next to each other, passing popcorn and hot dogs and sweets from one side to another and laughing out loud at the previous views. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, they quickly settled down to watch ... <br /> <br /> ... and did not dare to look until the final credits started rolling. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie; he does not finish paying his subplots of high school, he is not sure enough of his own tone, and his bullies are just a hair too much towards the sometimes inept critic. But the adaptation of the material of origin is essentially respectful, the plot joins rather well and skilfully runs between the sins of excess cheese and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts takes the film with surprising grace. Despite the excellent timing of Josh Flitter, this is Roberts' film, and she does it very well. His Nancy Drew is the direct predecessor of Veronica Mars, by Kristen Bell, and the film is also a direct descendant of Jodie Foster's precocious and underestimated "Candleshoe". <br /> <br /> In the market today, it is a rarity: a family movie that respects the intelligence of its viewers. As such, it will not be everyone's taste, but for what it is, it is the best movie of its kind in decades.
