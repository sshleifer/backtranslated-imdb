YETI deserves the rating of 8 stars because it is one of the best bad movies that have been made. I saw it in a midnight screening in L.A. and people roared and cheered madness. This movie is one of those train trains where you think you can not reach any strangers and THEN DO IT! The millionaire who finances the project to thaw the Yeti seems that Chris Penn and John Goodman dressed in a suit that did not fit well - the guy who plays the scientist is one of the worst actors that have appeared on the screen - and yes, there are A quiet boy (who looks a bit like a girl) and is mute since he survived a plane crash that killed his two parents (hmmm, maybe therapy for the child?). Then this Italian hottie is seen by Yeti (once it melts, it gets FOREVER), and is instantly in love with her. What is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant Yeti makes "bedroom eyes". in it, it's like a great Barry White trying to seduce a groupie. In fact, once the big Yeti lifts the hottie and holds it against her chest, she accidentally touches the Yeti's nipple and yes, the film takes the time to show off her big gray nipple. Yikes of all YIKES! In addition, there is a collie dog in him because the Italian producer must have heard that American audiences like dogs and that he tried a little to get a Lassie. There is also a crazy scene in which the Yeti eats a giant fish. It keeps the big spine and uses it. combs the hair of the Italian girl "Gee, thanks Yeti, now my hair is soft and smells like dead trout, you are the best". This movie is stranger than Ed Wood could have ever dreamed. If you are a fan of classic movie trash, look for this baby.
