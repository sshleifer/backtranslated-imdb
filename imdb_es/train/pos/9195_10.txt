I do not give a movie or a program ten very often, but this program touched a nerve in a way that no other program has. I found the entire series on mysoju.com and I thought the premise seemed interesting, so I took a look. I was not disappointed by what I saw; I was moved. This story is kept on the tender side while the main characters move us through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, interpreted thoughtfully by Koyuki, shows us human nature and wants to avoid showing problems. No one really wants to put their soul in front of a perspective partner. So instead of that, she replaces a human, played by an adorable Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This pet is like any other creature that we would consider a pet. The difference; He can retaliate in the same way, after all, Momo is a man, not a dog. When treated like a pet, it reacts to situations in which a dog can react. She spends time with the new boyfriend, Momo becomes jealous. When he realizes that his pet is not just a pet, the sexual tension between the two begins to get thicker: Momo is a prodigy of dance. His thinking changes slowly as we begin to take a look at his own thoughts. Matsumoto takes us to see a character that is very one-dimensional at first, two-dimensional when we see that he is a dancer, a three-dimensional character when we see him begin to fall in love with his teacher as a man, not as a dog. In my opinion, it's worth seeing this story just to see how this character develops. In addition, Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness that you almost start wanting to have one too. Neither of them wants to think about the future and how it will change their relationship, but as Momo says (the name she gives him what his new puppy would be called) says ?? We both knew that this was not going to be able to last. Watch this program with an open mind, it's worth it.
