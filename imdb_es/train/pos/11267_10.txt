Robert Wuhl is teaching a class of film students at the University of New York in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> It covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer known in general. I would like to see much more of this show. It is very entertaining. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "shows and says" to convey his points. He explained that the person who actually rode Paul Revere's Midnight Walk was not Paul Revere. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used Revere's name because it sounded better. <br /> <br /> I have seen Robert Wuhl for many years, since he was doing a comedy and even "Arli $$" on HBO. He is a good actor and a good comedian, but he is an excellent teacher! I recommend you watch an episode of this program. It's worth the time you spend.
