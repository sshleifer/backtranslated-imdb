['I&#39;m a man, not given to women&#39;s movies, but this is really a special story well done. I do not have a personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she does a great job, while DeNiro is her usual superb. Everything is so well done: acting, direction, visuals, adjustments, photography, casting. If you can enjoy a story of real people and real love, this is a winner.']
