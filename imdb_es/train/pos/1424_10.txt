['Rather annoying that the reviewers continue to compare this with Planet Earth ... Of course, Planet Earth is better, it has much more of the same. Earth is like an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series, and as such, it is inevitably inferior and simplified. But that is not to compare with similar. <br /><br /> Like a feature film documentary (or really like any feature film), it pretty much surpasses everything you&#39;ll see in your lifetime (unless you choose to cross the Earth in helicopters with long-range cameras for years and years, and wait months in environments more extreme to glimpse the most extraordinary beings on earth, which, let&#39;s face it, is unlikely). <br /><br /> In the narration: yes, everyone in the UK, including me, loves David Attenborough, and there are few excuses why he is not narrating here, but that hardly deserves to knock down a star or three. He was not a presenter on Planet Earth, just a narrator, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;s modest and kind enough to realize that anything that attracts more viewers is a good thing. <br /><br /> Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by his amazement, majesty and glory. All critics agree with that. Those who love him (that is, all) will go to see and buy a planet Earth. So three applauses for its cinematic release, and a big boooo for anyone who is cheap enough to buy this on DVD instead of the Planet Earth set. But as works of art, people are not competing here. <br /><br /> The Earth is big enough for both.']
