After a brief prologue that shows a masked man stalking and then beating the throat of an elderly gentleman on an abandoned, urban Australian street of the century, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they leave the house to hunt . They manage to get a loan for a repairman in an elegant Sydney street, but it turns out that physical deterioration is not the only problem with their new home. You can simply be enchanted. <br /> <br /> 13 Gantry Row combines a memorable story, albeit somewhat clich√©d, from good to medium by Catherine Millar in a surprise slightly above average. <br /> <br /> Larger failures They seem partially due to the budget, but they are not totally excusable to that obstacle. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the movie. The opening "thriller scene" presents some strange editions. Frozen frames and sets of still images are used to cover the fact that there is not much action. The suspense must be created from the staging, not with "fix it in the mix" techniques. There is a great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and so on, but the camera must be slowly following the murderer and the victim, trimming from side to side as we move down the street, showing their growing proximity . Tracking and cutting should be slow. The attack should be longer, clearer and better blocked. As it is, the scene has a strong sense of "made for television," and a low-budget one. <br /> <br /> After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film improves considerably. The story has many similarities with The Amityville Horror (1979), although the budget imposes a much more subtle approach. Millar and screenwriter Tony Morphett effectively create many cunningly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature rather than special effects, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old iron plates, which had been strangely placed on an interior wall. <br /> <br /> For some horror fans, the first section of the movie could be a bit heavy on the realistic drama. At least the first half hour of the film is mainly about Julie and Peter trying to organize the financing of the house and then try to settle. But Morphett writes an intelligent dialogue and well done. The material is made well enough so that it is often as intriguing as the more traditional thriller aspects that emerge later, especially if you have gone through similar situations while trying to buy your own home. <br /> <br /> Once they get it, things get weirder, although special effects often leave a lot to be desired, ideas are good. The performances help to create tension. There is not a lot of deaths and destruction in the movie, there are more than a lot of repair nightmares in the home. But no threat is really the point. <br /> <br /> The point is human relationships. There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it bitter and possibly destroy it. Being in an elegant neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only affect those who can blame some external problems, such as money or health problems. Peter's character evolves from a corporate employee who strives with "normal" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, planning to achieve something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time, we learn how superficial these professional friendships can be. Julie crosses an almost literal nervous crisis, but finally it finds the liberation when it is freed of its failed romantic relation. <br /> <br /> Although 13 Gantry Row never transcends its television clutter, like a television movie. , this one is pretty good, with admirable ambitions. Anyone who loves movies from haunted houses, psychological movies or horror films with a little more metaphorical depth should find a lot to enjoy. Certainly not worth spending $ 30 for a DVD (that was the price that my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the movie after they showed it (considering shipping and handling)), but it's worth renting it, and it's definitely worth seeing for free.
