I really have to disagree with guy-yardley-rees, who (if he had seen the whole movie) would have seen an absolutely stunning Scottish setting (some of the best filmed in Skye) and found a movie with a difficult start reunited in a whole really touching. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget movie. Rather, it is a movie that has a strong sense of community. <br /> <br /> I can not say how bored my 'standard' movies are: getting the same polished things over and over again. Seachd does not seem to be about that at all. It really seems to be trying to offer something more real and, certainly, more Gaelic than any recent Scottish film. <br /> <br /> Well, then the acting is not in the style of a blockbuster. That's because the actors are seemingly real people. In fact, I thought that the key roles of the child and his grandfather were really convincing, and sometimes unusually beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seachd really has a second visit, since there are many threads that become clearer on the second occasion - that really feeds the end. <br /> <br /> In general, the combination of music and (sometimes) impressive images, plus a communitarian approach to acting and non-normal structure has made Seachd a rather distinctive and memorable movie. More of these please!
