I'll come clean The only reason I found out about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is one of my favorite actors. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought it was going to be ... different, maybe in a not so good way. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading the few reviews on this short, I was really excited to see it. I sent my copy as soon as I could and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, it did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> The movie follows Jack, an insomniac who is often plagued by conditions that make him doubt what reality is and what is in his head. I will not reveal what happens, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be terrifying in its realism. <br /> <br /> The direction is fantastic, focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to do so. miss the entertainment or the moments of reflection. <br /> <br /> In general, I give this great movie 9 out of 10, for going far beyond what I thought any short could achieve.
