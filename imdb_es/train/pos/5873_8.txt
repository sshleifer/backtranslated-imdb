This would have been a safe fire classic if they had chosen ALMOST ANY MORE OF John Abraham. This guy is a horrible actor. Be it comedy, drama, tears, etc. Stinks. It seemed that at some point Priyadarshan also realized this, and practically made him jump like a monkey to make his solo scenes a little funny. <br /> <br /> It's the only noticeable drawback (there's a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an ABSOLUTELY hilarious film otherwise. The best comedy in Bollywood from Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy on the shoulders of a brilliant script and, of course, Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance to date. You'd better become the best comedian in each award show. AK has always been good at comedy, but he takes it to a different level here. Body language, facial expressions and the way you deliver each line. It's a great performance. The crowded theater was going crazy for most of the movie, and I think I've never seen such an environment for a Bollywood movie in the United States. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala does not do it. have a "main" heroine It is starring 3 incredibly HOT + Beautiful girls who thought they did a pretty good job. Pretty sure everyone is making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as always, although his routine runs out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is your typical annoying self (he's fed up with his exaggerated performance in each movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> In general, it is definitely worth a dekho. I'd say it's more fun than No Entry, and that's saying a lot. It could have been even better if they had chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
