And I absolutely adore Isabelle Blais !!! She was so cute in this movie, and very different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal", where she was more like a man-eater. I think I should have been nominated for a Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was very superior, IMO. Pelletier has done a good job for the first time, and I noticed that he had sneaked into a couple of friends from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It was fun to see them in this, I did not know they were going to appear. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've seen a romantic Quebec comedy that I did not like, and this is as good as any I've had the pleasure of seeing. And if you're in the United States and you wonder how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca gave it to me in less than a week.
