Good luck finding this movie to watch, it has not yet been released on tape or DVD. I saw it at the launch in the early 70's, I had the good fortune to catch it through the conservation efforts of American Cinematheque, and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to repeat the rwint. Accurate comments here. As an emerging director shortly after the great success of Five Easy Pieces, it has been said that Jack N managed the low budget effort as best he could, and it certainly shows in the meandering and meandering that he might have used some cuts. . But it is also a memorable icon for its time: the intense confrontations of the university sports of the late 60s, the student movements, the sexual revolution and more. <br /> <br /> Why watch this movie? Probably it was a decisive factor in some scenes: the playful of the men in the showers after the game; The scene of Karen Black with Tepper in the car will catch you off guard, but it's the first use of a word I had not witnessed in the movie before; and the casual and unexpected use of nudity in general. There are probably others that I am omitting. <br /> <br /> Look for a nice surprise from a young Cindy Williams in one of her first movies; a slender David Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren fresh out of his light blue UCLA uniform and preparing for a dark blue television uniform; Robert Towne - Actor; and many people just playing themselves. <br /> <br /> Now: any connection between the surname of Harry Gittes, Robert Towne and a certain character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> He gets a "7" based on Karen Black. You'll see why.
