We often watch movies about undesirable things that happen in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". In a role in which he was born to play, Al Pacino plays the mayor of New York who has to deal with the murder of a child. But it turns out that nothing he does will have any effect. In this film, the characters are as gritty as you would expect from anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust a certain politician, you can have your doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not name any specific example of something similar to what this movie describes, but that's it. It is not the issue. If we had idealistic impressions of those who are above, this film demolishes those ideas. Certainly one that I encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
