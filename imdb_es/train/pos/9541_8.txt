Wow baby, this is indeed a good horror / Asian blood, and a crazy extravagant movie. This is a Japanese festival that reminded me a bit of Tetsuo, except in this case with all the blood and guts, there is a strange love story. It's hard to imagine how they even imagined this visually stunning movie, with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into a partial machine or I guess cyborgs. The only bad thing about these creatures after they take charge of a human, is that they have to kill each other and eat each other. hmmm, ñam ñam This would probably be called industrial splash or something like that, with an excellent soundtrack to add to all the fun. The film also takes a bit of Carpenter's "The Thing" in design and creature effects. I would put this in the category essential for gorehounds, since there is a non-stop butchery and some very fine gore. And a must-have for drug addicts, since you do not even need to read the subtitles, the visual images are enough as a mental trip. The design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of Frank Henenlotter's films, which is another tribute to some excellent bloody movies with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is really fun for the gorehounds, there's no doubt about that, and I just loved it.
