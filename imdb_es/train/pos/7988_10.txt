Family and friends bothered me all the time because of my tears in the movies, and they did not disappoint me when I saw this. I cried many times, but believe me it was not because of excess. I hurt for the family and it hurt for this man as he tried to redeem himself in the only way he knew. Denzel was fabulous as always, and so was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, although I did not even recognize him; The years have not been kind to him. My husband is not one to watch movies again unless they are historically accurate war movies (snore!). He has already seen this movie 5 times and I am going to have to get the DVD to see it again because he has used it. Out of the tape and jumped all the time I was watching.
