Time has not been kind to this movie. Once controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, now this movie seems a mere conventional version of his typical ghost fight. Leaving aside the gruesome touches (especially the crazy, in the upper end), this is essentially a brilliant horror movie for those people who do not care much about the genre. He has an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast to convince the audience that this is not their Low-key average movie (the producers of disaster films of the 70s had a similar idea). I liked seeing the familiar faces, but the story is very silly, and no matter how high the film it pretends to be, it operates at the level of your 70's exploitation movie (it's not a bad thing). Still, it's a nice movie, especially for those spectators who enjoy stargazing. As usual, Albert Whitlock's matte work is outstanding. In general, quite entertaining.
