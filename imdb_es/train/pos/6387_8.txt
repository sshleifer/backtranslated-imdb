I thought that this movie was very well placed. The voiceovers were also great. I liked how everyone overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to see it. Atlantis has some funny scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me happy. It is a movie that any age can enjoy. From the moment that Milo is the crazy "teacher" or until he gathers the crew for the fantastic trip under the sea. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was also good, but the movie puts better images in your mind. It's like the book. But go and watch this movie!
