It is difficult to find an absolutely bad historical drama based on the life of any number of British monarchs. Simply take a well-respected British or Australian actor, make things look pretty and you are guaranteed a formula for Oscar success. <br /> <br /> The Young Victoria is no exception, she is doing things well, the cinematography is amazing. And beautiful, with soft lights and exuberant colors and fabrics. Starring Emily Blunt in a role that can finally rise, the film begins with Victoria's 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and problems surrounding her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend ). As young Victoria laments, she has moved like a chess pawn due to a variety of matches while finding her balance and her voice as one of Britain's most influential rulers. <br /> <br /> While this moves around the chessboard is fairly typical territory, it is the development of Victoria's relationship with Albert that makes the film a bit more interesting. I confess: I have a degree in history with a specialization in the Victorian era, so I am a little attached to these figures. Despite their many defects as rulers, Victoria and Albert were some of the first leaders dedicated to improving civilization for their people. They left their legacy in the arts, in public health and education, and in conservative views and culture of mourning Victoria after the death of Albert. But these things only briefly insinuated during the film. <br /> <br /> It's pretty well established that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love, but they had a level of mutual respect that is not usually seen among monarchs. In arranged marriages. Even if it happened behind the scenes, his was undoubtedly one of the best known. Blunt and Friend have the right kind of chemistry to do justice to the famous couple, the right combination of moderation and desperation. It's a different love, which is not usually shown on the screen, especially in this type of movie. It is encouraging to finally see a relationship in which men and women are on equal terms. <br /> <br /> But we can not see that love enough. While filmmakers try to fit the issue between political traps, the kind of momentum necessary to keep the tension high does not build up. Also, without going into the most important important public work of the couple, things feel a bit in limbo, superficial rather than intimate and, sometimes, confusing. It's not such a big problem during the movie, but afterwards, the effects disappear quite quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just saw, despite the perfect performances of the drivers, especially Blunt, who even captures the expressions of the famous monarch. <br /> <br /> As much as I try, Victoria is successful on many levels, but lacks the brightness that would take it from solid to classic.
