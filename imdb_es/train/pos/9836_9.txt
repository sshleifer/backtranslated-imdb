Although it is not as creepy as its cult classical ancestor (ZOMBI 2), I actually like this one more. This is due to its faster pace, better settings and the soundtrack of the 80s. It is loaded with action and has sweet Gore effects from Lucio Fulci. Zombies do not look as unpleasant as in ZOMBI 2 but they still look good. It was done pretty well but it definitely has its share of cheese; For example, some zombies move very slowly, while others are as fast as ninjas. some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects coherence when it comes to the Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How rad is that? Definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. It would probably also satisfy most fans of action movies. You can also watch Zombie 4.
