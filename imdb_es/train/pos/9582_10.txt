['After growing up on the gritty streets of Detroit, MI, and having friends who traveled to New York dances, I fell into the lifestyle of being a member of the House. I joined the house of thieves. We adapted the same rules as most houses, but we were professional thieves who would increase and commit fraud with credit cards to obtain the fabulous jewelry and clothes we wanted. I even learned to profess to write checks and driver&#39;s licenses and collect them in more than seventeen states, until a jealous queen called me to the Secret Service and went to federal prison. But, I learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I recommend that you see it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in the houses here in Detroit and the criminal activity we did. My book, Identity Schemes is available for sale on Amazon dot com or Identity Schemes dot com. But trust me, it&#39;s much better than Paris is burning, because it&#39;s a 2005 brand.']
