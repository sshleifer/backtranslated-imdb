This is undoubtedly the best standing show in history. I've seen many stand-up shows, I've been to many stand-up shows, and I've seen Bet's Comic View, but I've never seen anyone who could match Murphy's skills in this show. The impressions are excellent, the scenes are excellent and the time is perfect. You can even say that people really get involved. When he did it with Raw a few years later, it was also very good, but this is number 1 in my book. It also shows that, at a given time, especially between the early and mid-eighties, Murphy was funny. My favorite part of the program is when he is recounting the family barbecue and "Ice cream! Mooommm! The ice cream man is coming!" Another big part is where his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
