I was surprised by the improvements made in an animated film. If you sit near the screen, you will see the details in the structures of the grass and the surface. The detail, colors and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story. How they were able to take out the shading, I'll never know. I hope that PIXAR will provide a documentary about how the film was produced in order to discover how this was achieved. Based on this film, I believe that the animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film.
