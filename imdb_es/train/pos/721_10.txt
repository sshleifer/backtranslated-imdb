ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL has a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones. I was too young during the heyday of the mid-'70s to be very aware of them, although I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. One afternoon, in the mid-80s, when I was about fifteen years old, I saw RNRHS on television, and I laughed all the time. (Is not it the dream of all the kids in high school to tear up their school and blow it up, all ready for a rock soundtrack? Again, thinking "Man, these guys kick ass! I have to check some of their albums! "The rest is history." Twenty years, Ramones' countless LP / cassette / CD, and three Ramones shows later, are still one of my favorite bands of all time and RNRHS still criticizes me every time I see it Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (RIP to all), at least we have this movie and tons of excellent music to remember them.
