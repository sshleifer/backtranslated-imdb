This movie does an excellent job of describing the plight of a person with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). The theme is done with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is as convincing as a person with ALS that I found it hard to believe that she only acted. Kenneth Branagh, an excellent actor, lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide company to Helena's character as part of his "community service," an alternative to prison time. Observing the development of the relationship between these two is a pleasure from beginning to end. The fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances. One comes to take care of both deeply.
