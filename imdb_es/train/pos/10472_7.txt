Anyone who loves the music of the rheostats will enjoy this movie. I have some minor complaints, mainly about the pace and casting of certain actors (not Maury) who are not really convincing in their roles, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this movie or plan to watch this movie as it was shown on CBC television in Canada: the version that is broadcast is CBC's version is like Reader's Digest READING LECTURE version - not the see Trim entire scenes and subplots (if you can) of the movie. The CBC, which presents most of the films intact, took half the guts of WHALE MUSIC. I do not know why it's horrible what they did to the movie. Rent the video or watch it in a theater, but DO NOT watch it on CBC television.
