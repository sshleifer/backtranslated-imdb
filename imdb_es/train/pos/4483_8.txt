Everything must be a musical comedy. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) does not miss a step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) does not lose a note. The scenes with them together are very good, since they show the amount of talent that can be added to a somewhat uneven plot. "I fall in love easily" by Sinatra is an indication of his best and future. Kelly's "Mexican sombrero dance" with a young Mexican woman is a delight. Kelly certainly won his nomination as Best Actor. And there is a multitude of really fun lines, like: "Do you think the navy dares?"; "Do you think someone sings to a sailor to sleep?"; and, "We got into a little problem, we picked up a small child." A very nice film, ideal to shake off the dust of a recently concluded World War II.
