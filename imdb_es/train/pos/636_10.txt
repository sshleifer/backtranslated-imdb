Why the previews are so blah for a movie that is so awesome! Everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. It is attractive and fun from the first moment, original and well acted. I wish the movie made as good a press as it deserves! <br /> <br /> For anyone who loves the promised princess, the labyrinth and other truly fun and original fantasy adventures, this is one of the best. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leader. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is making a big splash with her recent returns to the screen. There are also many wonderful moments of minor characters ... even facial expressions.
