This film, although it deals with one of the most favorite themes of Mexican producers: extreme life in our cities, has a fun way of putting it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the most important Mexican directors, in recent times, approach the stories of our city framed in various literary types such as farce or satire, which gives us a film with a excessive exposure. Theme in our country, but narrated in a very different way that gives it a tone of freshness. <br /> <br /> With little known actors, but excellently interpreting their role, each of the directors reflects in the stories the capacity for which we have been identified in any part of the world, the ability to laugh and To celebrate sadness. Maybe many people in our country did not like the movie, but I think that people from other countries could find attractive and share the surrealism of Mexicans.
