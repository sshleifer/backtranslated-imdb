I did not like Chandni Bar of the same director. <br /> <br /> I did not see your other movies. They came and they left. <br /> <br /> But page 3 is well done. It seems real. As did Satya from RGV. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of the so-called high society is the summary of the film. In the midst of all the illness, it is difficult to lead a normal life that makes the protagonist, Konkana Sen. Serious movie, not to be seen with children or wives. Page 3 of the newspapers is the usual place to report on the activities that take place in the parties of the rich and the elites that are delivered to much more trash than is reported. How this page-3 is also a business perspective is shown in the movie. Event management companies are paid to organize parties and make famous people rich but not famous by clicking on the pictures with the celebrities invited to the party. <br /> <br /> Western culture has slipped into Mumabi's high society quite deeply. The film shows it boldly, without restrictions. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.
