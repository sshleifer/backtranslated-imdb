I think if it's a good movie or not, you have to make movies of this kind. It reminds me of "I love Huckabees", an overwhelmingly disconcerting movie with Isabelle Huppert being sodomized by a young American man in a muddy pond, in a cheerful and masochistic way (?? !!!!). I hope the director continues to cross the border, as if I felt that the decisions made by Vincenzo Natali were not always subtle (some of the scenes were, unfortunately, a kind of "tarte-à-la-crème", like a slapstick infantile), speaking of script and cinematography? The color of "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, more cheerful, surprisingly, than the previous Natali films.
