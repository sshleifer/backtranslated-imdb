Even if he knows absolutely nothing about Ireland, he has to love "My Left Foot" (and especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis). He plays Christy Brown, who suffers from cerebral palsy. Because of this, he has spent most of his life on the sidelines. Even when they try to warn people about something, they just laugh at him. The light in the dark for him is that he has control over a part of the body: his left foot. He uses that appendix to paint and write poetry, giving prominence. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well in this collaboration, and also in a later collaboration: "In the name of The Father" (but "The Boxer" was unnecessary). "My left foot" can make you feel in many ways: sad, hopeful or something more. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave the performance of his life here. A great movie in every way.
