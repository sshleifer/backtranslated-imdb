Surreal film noir premiered shortly after the "real" classics, which define the genre, "The Maltese Falcon", "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Welles films should not be evaluated against others. He was playing by different rules. In fact, he was playing. This starts where other femme fatale movies stop working, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) whodunit is embellished with a screen of wellesian scenes (typical style of rapid fire), dialogue (a lot of "hard" philosophy) and a performance unusual (good Hayworth presumably intentionally one-dimensional). For Welles, the "genre" may have meant "formula", but it seemed that he liked to use "mysteries" as funds for his "entertainments".
