The first time I had the chance to see this classic almost forgotten was in the early 80's, in one of our art houses as a renaissance. While I was watching this feverish dream of an exercise in sexuality of 1930, I thought YOWZA! They escaped with the murder in Europe in their day. Unfortunately, this movie was heavily cut in its original release in the US. UU For Hayes's blue-nosed office (the government's strong censorship board, started by the Bible beater "holier than you", Will Hayes ... a former Post Office official, if you can believe that) , due to its general theme of human sexuality (the forbidden humans of heaven actually had sexual intercourse in the 1930s). The plot of Ecstasy refers to a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a much older man, and then regrets it. She (Lamarr) meets a handsome young man and has an affair with him, resulting in a divorce from the previous husband (another no, not in the Hollywood movies of that time, divorce!). Although the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the first time that the director worked on the sound format (that is, the film seems to possess techniques that were used mainly in silent films, that is, in the expressionism of 1920 ). It is still worth looking for a window to the first European talking images, along with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and 'Vampyre' by Karl Gustav Dryer (1931). Not classified, but it contains that infamous nude swimming scene and some sexual references with little veil, which would cost little more than a PG-13 by today's standards (but it would have easily landed the dreaded 'X', in the 30s, if then exist)
