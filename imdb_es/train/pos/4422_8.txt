Well, if you are one of those crazy Katana movies (like me), you will surely appreciate this action movie of samurai metaphysical Katana spinning in blood. <br /> <br /> Starring Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) and Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This war of samurai between the Heiki clan and the Genji clan reaches its zenith in the final confrontation on the Gojo bridge. The count of corpses is uncountable. <br /> <br /> Demons, magical swords, Shinto priests versus Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by Master Sogo Ishii will do the rest. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese movie for a rainy summer night.
