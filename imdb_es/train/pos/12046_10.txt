There is nothing remotely frightening about modern "horror," which is an insult to the word "horror." Freddie Vs Jason, the films of Scream, Cabin Trash and, especially, the infantile attempts of Stephen King: he has recycled all the stories of The Monkey's Paw to whatever, often in the same story, both in writing and in the movie (except in the Kubrick version of The Brilliant, which was really scary, unlike King's books, which are as frightening as my big toe: the left one, which still has the nail. <br /> < But The Woman In Black is that rare modern movie that will make the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.This is the way it should be done: the director creates tension and the most frightening ghost that You have actually seen it just by having it suddenly stop somewhere or other with that incredible, expensive look, then take it all to a horrifying and disturbing closure.You learned your lessons from the masters who knew how to make the horror: Val Lewton (Cat Original people) and Rober t Wise (a disciple of Val Lewton and director of Haunting and The Body Snatcher), Jacques Tou More (another disciple of Val Lewton who directed a really horrible zombie movie, not the garbage that Raimi did (the serious thing is not fear, friends , it just is) and Lewis Allen (The Uninvited), and of course Jack Clayton's turn on Henry James The Innocents, and how the master of suspense, Hitchcock, can still take you to the edge of your seat, even with a piece of slow and ardent construction period like Under Capricorn. .
