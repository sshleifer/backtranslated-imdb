To prevent his gay friend Albert (Perry King) from being deported to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem with that is that Stella is a lesbian. The two have their separate lives when, one night after Albert's birthday party, they go to bed and then fall in love. Later in the film, after falling in love, Stella suspects that Albert cheated and shows up at work late one night after closing. What you find will leave the viewer stunned. This is a great movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it's amazing that they have not been better recognized for their work here. Very controversial about its release in 1978, the film with "R" rating is now "PG" in this much more liberal time. <br /> <br /> Recently released on DVD, the disc contains a segment "Making Of" in the special features and it states that the film was based on a true story, so the viewers say that the movie is not "real" are wrong. Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons: these are the themes explored in this wonderful movie for all who ever loved!
