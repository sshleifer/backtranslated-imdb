A highly recommended masterpiece, not only for the underlying themes of the story, but also for Angelopoulos' incredibly brilliant and ingenious image work, not to mention the performance of the giants, Mastroianni and Moreau, and the extraordinary interpretation of characters from Ilias Logothethis. The performance of Gregory Karr may seem overshadowed by his "hard" teammates in the first position, but in fact perfectly interprets his character, which is revealed in his last scene with the girl (Khrysikou) and the man (Mastroianni), although hinted earlier. (Therefore, the spoiler). <br /> <br /> Clarify your expectations! It is an "art film" in the sense that the phrase has to offer and requires attention. Not to spend free time, but to see a work of art with the necessary concentration to read a book or attend a concert. Due to the general photographic style, the large-screen display is recommended. <br /> <br /> The dialogues are used sparingly. But the film includes, in addition to the standard fragments of Greek and English speech, spoken in Albanian, Kurdish and Turkish, which will be attractive to those who are delighted with the beauty of listening to several languages.
