I have not read all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version could be abbreviated. I'm curious about that because the last parts of the movie just did not make much sense to me, even when I saw them again. 30 minutes seems to be really short for a movie in 1917 as well. "Poor Little Rich Girl", which was the next Tourneur movie, is 65 minutes long and "Pride of the Clan", which was his previous film, was 84 minutes. So I'm relieved to see that I was not crazy, part of this film must be missing and that's why the resolution did not make much sense. <br /> <br /> It's hard to review or comment on a movie that you can only see half of ... but I would recommend this movie anyway because of the really fascinating insight that the inside of a movie studio gives us. the East Coast of the time. It is the first film I have seen personally, based on the film industry itself. The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick, who was later the lead actor in Hollywood and appeared in almost every Preston Sturges movie. He plays a Western actor, perhaps vaguely inspired by William S. Hart, whom Warwick looks a bit like. After the really fascinating sequences that develop in the studio, we see them in a photo shoot where he discovers a country girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test that goes very wrong. After that point, it seems that the film is missing important pieces in the way we have now. <br /> <br /> Again, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in film history because of the documentary value, but in the way that it is not as good as a movie and is not a particularly good example of work by Maurice Tourneur.
