['Yes, it&#39;s another great Muppet magic movie and I adore them all; The characters, the movies, the episodes of television programs (it is the best comedy or musical program in history) and all the artists that support it. But here they made such a weird fatal mistake and I&#39;m probably talking about the strange ending! <br /><br /> I think it is very dangerous to involve so much in the American drama and end a love story with marriage! We, like all poor spectators, feel so free or perhaps happy about the absence of their discomfort, discomfort and misery! So we all enjoy these stories that bring together 2 beautiful heroes as a couple in love without the legitimate link like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So with all the previous couples and their likes I bet you feel safe, serenity and peace. Therefore, when you look at what the creators of this film had already done, you will be as crazy as me! <br /><br /> They made the weak and miserable creature (Kermit) marry her daily nightmare, the most irritating woman in history (Miss Piggy). This is a historic change because of the measures of the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on the audience that he simply refused to bless or believe or be satisfied with that sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog did not have the time or the right opportunity to think or decide anything!). Therefore, it is not surprising when he knows that this film is the most unsuccessful in its cinematic seriousness, collecting only 25 million compared to 65 million won by the first (The Muppet Movie - 1979) five years before! <br /><br /> Simply in this film they took Manhattan, and my rest too!']
