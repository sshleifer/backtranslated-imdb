Every country that has an active film industry has some healthy artist (and maybe a demented one) who makes films that you can only fully understand when you are part of this country. I guess Hundstage is a movie like that. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, disturbed, strange, hateful. But they still have enough money to buy tuned cars and big houses. And they are definitely doing many strange things here that may seem "normal" to them because they are doing it all their lives. From a normal human point of view, you can now easily follow the movie and feel disgusted or fascinated and see a good piece of Austrian art films. <br /> <br /> But if you LIVE here and you meet people, you see the characters in Hundred as the society's tumor. A society that is becoming crazier day by day, creating its own rules that no one else can understand, topples the social system from within. AND YOU SEE the people. Sitting in the park, standing in the opposite corner, queuing on the same line. Maybe you find them in a bar or in a disco you can visit. Maybe you even work with them at work or live near your home. You start to hate them without knowing exactly why. You will try to escape, but you can not. Maybe you'll finish like them. But it seems "normal" for you because you are doing it throughout your life now ... <br /> <br /> Life is not so bright, although Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. He has beautiful people ... but some are also ugly. There are a lot of people who work hard and try to do their best ... but there are also some who are mounted on the backs of others and destroying everything that the people of Austria have accumulated up to now. <br /> <br /> A very pessimistic. movie.
