A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs that contained two movies each. One of them had Three Broadway Girls (an alternative title for The Greeks Have a Word for Them) and this, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a behind-the-scenes musical comedy set in Scotland and it refers to an erroneous identity that involves one of the dancers who hooks up in a millionaire's limousine. Vera-Ellen is that dancer and, what legs! Ceasar Romero is her producer who takes a risk with her after the original protagonist leaves because she thinks she is dating the millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is that rich guy who, when he looks for Vera-Ellen, is confused with a reporter who is supposed to interview her but Romero stops him. What I just mentioned can be confusing, but (mostly) it makes sense if you're willing to check your brain while watching this lovely and charming comedy with wonderful musical numbers, as interpreted by the exquisite Mrs. Vera-Ellen. Romero may be a little frantic here, but Niven becomes hilariously baffled. The impression I saw was quite good, considering its age and the fact that it is in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen is doing pretty well with her lines since she is not really an actress. So in that sense, I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie lovers who love old-fashioned musical comedies.
