I am a college student who studies at-levels and I need help and comments from anyone who has an opinion on the subject of mothers in the film, in the mother. Whether you've gone through something similar or just want to comment and help me investigate more about this movie, any comments would be greatly appreciated. The comments will be used only for exam purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have an opinion, I'm sure I can use it and you could help me get an A! I'm also studying 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole', so if you've also watched these movies, I'd appreciate it if you could leave comments here on that page. Thank you.
