While prices have gone up a lot, and some of the details have become outdated, any homeowner who has had problems with home ownership should have a lot of laughs in this movie. I know I did it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings, a New York advertising executive, decides to move with his family to the suburbs of Connecticut and build a nice house there. It gets into one hilarious jam after another, from mortgages to lawsuits and construction difficulties, as the costs and schedule of construction continue to rise out of control. I thought the funniest scenes were where Blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig hundreds of feet, but they never find water. However, within walking distance, a few days later, the basement of your home-to-be floods! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give credible performances as the beleaguered Blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better as a lawyer and friend of the Blanding family. <br /> <br /> The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a kind of naive fool who has no idea how many additional problems she is causing, and there is a maid black (horrors!). So do not watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you'll enjoy it even more. <br /> <br />
