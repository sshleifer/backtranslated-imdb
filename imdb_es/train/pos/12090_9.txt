I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parents' basement on a Saturday night. He was being shown in "Chiller Theater," a regular feature of fear that he viewed religiously as a young man. Now, I've seen many old horror films thanks to Chiller Theater, but none of them hit me like "Danse Macabre", a.k.a. "Castle of Blood". Now I am 51 years old, and only last year I was lucky enough to find a relatively recent and quality DVD edition of this supernatural classic wonderfully provoking chills, thinking that I would never get to see it again. I've seen it four times, and it seems I can not get tired. <br /> <br /> They do not make more spooky movies like this one anymore. Haunted catacombs and cemeteries shrouded in fog simply do not work as well in color as in black and white in the past. Anyway, this one has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, deliciously somber, skewered in castles, restless spirits recreating their deaths ... and a perversely ironic ending. <br /> <br /> IMO, this one is up there with "The Haunting", "The Innocents" by Robert Wise (with Deborah Kerr), and the most recent "The Others".
