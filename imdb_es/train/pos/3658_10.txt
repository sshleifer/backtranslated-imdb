This movie is like an allegory of the gospel. He has such direct honesty and innocence that one can not believe it was done after the world war, when Italy was devastated and devastated, and was filled with a huge impoverished and homeless population. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as to the infinite creative resources of that land of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto is a character like the "Idiot" of Doestoevisky, a modern Christ who finds his way in a big city. It is kindness and purity fortified by love, and its acts change the people with whom it is found, as well as the dove that performs miracles. The story is told in a natural and simple way, but impregnated with a magic that is almost a premonition of Fellini's surrealist fantasies. It is one of the most inspiring and stimulating films ever made.
