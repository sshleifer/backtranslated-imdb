Although DiG! It was hailed as the closest to what is the music industry, as it is highly manufactured. The director has tricked the audience into believing that the Brian Jonestown Massacre disappeared from the face of the earth after '98. And the rivalry between the Dandy Warhols and Jonestown has been milked. The truth of the matter is not really exposed in this movie. <br /> <br /> That said, this film is endless and it's an interesting watch, since we see two groups of very talented musicians who create their art. One of the best things about this movie is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended mainly for music and the two fantastic bands.
