Who votes on these ratings? "Jacknife" is a beautifully acted piece of work, brilliantly watched, with actors at the top of their game, especially Ed Harris and the incomparable Robert DeNiro (please, do not mention Marlon Brando in the same breath as this man-see "Taxi Driver" for the confirmation of this point). Is it a 'mundane' movie because it does not have nonsense sex / action / nudity? This film is about the complexities of the characters involved. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional outburst towards the end is heartbreaking. The part where he orders a young man in a bar to take off his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and cinema take advantage of tragic situations and how real men are frustrated when they see a young man addicted to military attire While we are on this topic, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the best movies of all time, one of the best directors, starring the best film actor of all time, with the most spooky psychotic mafioso in history, just justified above average? COME ON!!!!!
