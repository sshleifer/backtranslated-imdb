SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A friend of mine said that NEXT MOVIE was the best movie of Cheech & Chong and he went out of his way to borrow it from me and THE BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, it has no rhythm, it really does not have anything that defines a movie ... but it's fun. And for what it's worth, Cheech and Chong show some heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this little paragraph I put the plot, but since it's four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that normally starts a story. I'll just say that Cheech's cousin appears. <br /> <br /> Was not there another more fun time when Chong made Cheech drink the pee twice? What's up with the rooster? Was that the first appearance of Pee-Wee Herman? You should see the movie to enjoy it. I do not think NEXT MOVIE has the balls strong enough to be impressive, but the movie has a heart and, hey, my friend lent it to me to get a 7.
