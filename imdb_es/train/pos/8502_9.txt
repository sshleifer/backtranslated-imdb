Gung Ho is one of those movies that you'll want to see again and again. Michael Keaton is put in charge of attracting a Japanese automotive company to come to his city and thus create jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is a hilarious moment after another. The two cultures collide and it is up to Keaton to keep things together. Look for the great performances of Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are perfectly fused. Do not be fooled by the low number rating. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name of the city of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
