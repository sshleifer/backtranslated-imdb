Yes, the plot is predictable; Yes, there are some holes in the plot; Yes, it has a quality made for TV; and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" the book with obvious self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget all that ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Fun in a after school program Special kind of way, but nevertheless fun. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen as the mother does a great job ... so good that I'm going to start watching her movies. She reminded me of Diane Lane for all the good reasons. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also does a good job. If I were a casting agent, I would be exploring some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are above the usual television standards and the music was really great ... better than several big budget movies I've seen it. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for the German noir, this movie is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and underestimated movie, this is a good one. It's something you can show your 10-year-old daughter, but enjoy it too.
