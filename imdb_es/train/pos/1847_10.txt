In whatever you become in your life, you must never forget that you have roots. This is the story of real events that became a beautiful and moving movie! I dare say that this movie is very undervalued. This shows us a reality of life ... the more evil surrounds you, the better you become. Trust your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live happily. ... without rancor, without living "under a rock". The concept of the film is more than interesting ... connecting the narrative with real life events ... keeping up with everything ... from facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See it, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism, it's about how to live your life!
