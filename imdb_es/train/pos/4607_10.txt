My favorite movie by Jackie Chan will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this 1985 movie, "Police Story". In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super cop who lashes out at a known crime lord and his gang, and then is assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so he can turn the state's evidence. As the story progresses, the gangster sends his thugs to send Lin, but Chan takes care of his own fists and feet, while keeping the girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay. Like "Drunken Master," "Police Story" has many of the iconic acrobatics and exaggerated action / martial arts choreographies that Chan has become famous for, culminating in a real battle in a crowded shopping mall. In his role as director, Chan excels in excellence, giving a charismatic and fun performance that accentuates the action. While the light on the general mood of "Drunken Master", in the background "Police Story" is just that, a police story, a rough police thriller that would often be copied in the coming years. <br /> <br /> 10/10
