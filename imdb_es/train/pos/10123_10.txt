Shinjuku Triad Society: China Mafia Wars is unlikely to be distributed in the West outside of film festivals. Why? Could their censors endure a film in which policemen rape suspicious men and women to talk (and the victims enjoy it) or see an old woman take her eye out of her skull? These are just some of the shocks in the store for the spectators of this story of ultraviolent policemen and mobsters. It makes Clockwork Orange, which was banned for years in the UK, look like a Disney caricature. <br /> <br /> Should you watch this movie? YES It is a fantastic and essential visualization for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moments are there to illustrate what happens in the world of these characters. If you like this, be sure to catch Dead or Alive, which is very similar (except for the crazy ones that end up in DOA, of course). Excellent for Japan who have a talent like Miike who works at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to see this movie outside a retrospective of Takashi Miike at a film festival is on DVD. If I have not discouraged you, try to find a version of Hong Kong on the web, as I am sure it will come out in that country.
