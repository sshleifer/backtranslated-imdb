I did not know the real events when I sat down to look at this, just the fact that it was based on a real story. After the death of the boy's father, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree (... she did not know that someone named her offspring) to deal with the loss. This is really for children, as is usually the case with "family" movies (with that said, go ahead, gather everyone for a visit, although I would keep teenagers out of it, unless you are sure that they are going to buy the concept), but does not detract from the death of a father, and does not really talk to anyone. The plot is interesting enough, and it goes well enough. The performance varies, with the excellent Burstyn startling most of his castmates, Mathis follows it quite well, and Ferland and his teammates (with some exceptions) are the least convincing of the group (and, frankly, they are irritating; really in the intended audience for this thing). Editing and cinematography are standard, and certainly not less than that. While humor is limited to a handful of funny lines, the tone is not unpleasant. There is an intense scene or two in this. I recommend it to fans of this type of movies. 7/10
