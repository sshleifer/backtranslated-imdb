I thought this was an absolutely delightful film centered on the lives of the characters of Mary-Kate and Ashley, Sam and Emma Stanton! Both are trying to make themselves and their parents happy, but; Unfortunately, it is not so easy for them to do it! I thought this was an absolutely charming and sweet movie, and if you are a true fan of these wonderful ladies, I'm sure you'll agree with me here! If you have not seen this movie yet, then I tell you that you really missed it; in a big way, and that you should definitely take the time to see it now! This movie is a true winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
