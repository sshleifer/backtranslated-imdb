Something about "Paulie" touched my heart like few movies do. It is an ingenious, funny but emotional film. I'm late to be a fan of this movie. I did not see "Paulie" until May 2004 and since then I ordered the widescreen DVD from an eBay seller. <br /> <br /> The special effects of showing Paulie talking are excellent. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases. Probably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in the company Gena Rowlands (Ivy) followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent role as the good-hearted human. You support him all the way to the movie. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong when renting or buying this movie !!
