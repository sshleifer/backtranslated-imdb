In Holland, a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. Spend the night with a beautiful woman, Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and have sex with her (imagining he is a child). He plans to leave the next day, but sees a picture of Christine's boyfriend, Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay and try. Then things get strange. <br /> <br /> A great art house with X rating in the USA. UU In 1983. Why was it rated with X? Let's see ... there is strangulation, frontal and frontal male nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will impact most people, a scene of gay sex in a crypt ... and everything It is a comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did this after "Spetters." "Spetters" was attacked by critics for their extreme sexual sequences and denounced as garbage. Then, Verhoeven filled this film with a very obvious symbolism, thinking that critics would think it was art and praise it. He was right! The critics loved the movie without realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke with them. Still, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully filmed by Jan de Bont (right now director) and there is so much symbolism and obvious layers "hidden" in the dialogue that you never get bored. All the acting is great: Krabbe plays a completely despicable character but (in some way) has you encouraged for him; Soutendijk is simply stunning and plays his role perfectly: the small smile he gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body; he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and for going with Krabbe in the crypt. <br /> <br /> This is not for people easily offended or weak at heart, but if you like extreme movies that challenge you playfully (like me) this is for you! A 10 to the end.
