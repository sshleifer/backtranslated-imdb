"Shall We Dance?", A cheerful film from Japan, tells of an accountant and an overworked family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he sees from the train during his daily commute. What he finds in the studio are dance lessons and, above all, himself. Fun, moving and absolutely charming, "SWD" is an award-winning film that is worth seeing more mature viewers. (SECOND)
