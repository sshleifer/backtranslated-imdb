First things first, the female protagonist is too beautiful to lose her. Now the actress Wang Zu Xian, who played Xiao Qian in the film, is 42 years old and well aged. It is always good to review these glorious times when you see old school Hong Kong productions like this one. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential titles made in the 80s. The artistic decoration and other aesthetic facets are fascinating. More fantastically, the film had a total black humorous nuance in it. It feels like a horror movie, but in the end it's not scary, it's just fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating the second script of "A Chinese Ghotst Story", and I thought that script was a decent script. . However, when I saw the film, I was first disappointed to see the film different from the script, as on a smaller scale and involving more comedic roles. However, it turned out to be better executed in terms of entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the Lord of the Rings, you will notice the similarities in this movie with LOTR. The climax is like a mirror of Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch. It's definitely a laugh out loud. Bravo!
