Letters without destination end up in another world that is in the back rooms of the post office. Here, Alice manages to get a job hoping to find her lost father. What she discovers is the tormented soul of her boss, Frank. A small, quiet Australian flic that went to and from the movies. Now you find it in the dark corner of the video store, overshadowed by fifty copies of that dreaded GODZILLA movie. It's a shame because it turned out to be a satisfying movie that tells a brave story with strong and simple images and an effective performance of the two drivers. This movie succeeds where Garry Marshall's other dead card office movie DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) failed, and approaches the brightness of, not the turkey Kevin Costner, but the POSTMAN of He Jianjun (1995 - China).
