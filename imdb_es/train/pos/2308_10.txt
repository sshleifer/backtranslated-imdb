I checked it as an impulse while browsing the movie store and I could not have been more pleasantly surprised! My mom and I watched this movie together, and we enjoyed it very much. It's not the typical "chick-flick" with a sappy love story and tears all the way through, but it definitely touches a nerve in the turn at the end. It is an ending where, although unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not impaired. I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this movie, her debut, and it's definitely worth watching! I did not recognize many of the support actors, but they all play their important support roles well. "The man on the moon" is such a credible story about a young teenager who falls in love for the first time. Most women can definitely relate to everything, from Witherspoon's words, their subtle glances and their not-so-subtle emotions (furious as the typical teenager). While playing a confused character about love, she is not so stupid and immature, which was much appreciated considering many movies nowadays.
