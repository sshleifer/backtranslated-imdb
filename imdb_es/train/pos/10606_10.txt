I just finished watching this movie and I thought it was very nice. It's a small, quiet movie that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It simply takes you to the lives of people who live in a small village in the wooded areas of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a good performance as Raymond Toker, a lonely young man who finds an abandoned baby in the forest. Toker's search for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a viscous swindler with a ulterior motive. And David plays the bad guy perfectly. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this movie than meets the eye. Filmed in a place in North Carolina and with a wonderful soundtrack of traditional music, it's worth seeing.
