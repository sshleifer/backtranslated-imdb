Big Rock Candy Mountain is amazing. I saw it when I was little, and I still do it to this day (senior in high school). If I could imagine the sky, it would look like that. I wish I could live in the great mountain of rock candy where sweets grow on the trees. Zach Hyman is profs, and my best friend. Little Bunny Foo Foo is the man. It is so fuzzy and colorful that I dream it at night. In fact, my 18-year-old friend saw him for the first time and loved him. I recommend that people of all ages watch this movie. I'm going to have a big party this weekend with all my friends to watch this amazing movie. We are going to ask for pizza and see the giggle of the teddy bears. I am constantly observing the clouds and wishing to be that girl who visited me. Thank you. goodbye.
