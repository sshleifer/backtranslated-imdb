The goal of making this film, one of the first and best international releases of cinematic opera color, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And he got it admirably. The general public would not stand still for a love story about two exotic young lovers in ancient Egypt if it were played by the typical 300 pounds over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal team to sing the glorious music correctly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful directors (a young Loren, the beautiful Della Marra and a Miss Maxwell) that make the story much more credible, which gives those who are not familiar with the plot or the music a better opportunity to be seduced by history. Lovely arias that otherwise could not be. All in all, a lovely introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in high school and it certainly aroused my interest in opera, a form I did not know well. I still consider this film with love and I would strongly recommend it to those who appreciate good music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for the public he did not appear in any other movie.
