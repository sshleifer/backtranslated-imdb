['A beautiful and moving film that deserves a wider visualization than you are likely to get. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second generation of Turkish immigrants, who tries to break the mold. Neither completely at home with her moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with her Danish liberal friends, the experience of Aicha&#39;s martial arts becomes a struggle to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be who she wants to be in spite of the family and friends. <br /><br /> The director Natasha Arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative so that it has depth without becoming a heavy philosophical discourse, and the use of Xian Gao&#39;s choreography skills translates into spectacular sequences of struggle. In the end, however, it is the surprising debut of Semra Turan that gives this film the spirit. The raw charisma and the necessary martial arts skills are complemented with the heart to make your personal drama credible. <br /><br /> Good worth it.']
