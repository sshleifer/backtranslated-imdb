The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture in which we are bathed. Naturally, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. Attacks stand-up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, successful Hollywood movies and touches in many other media. Eventually, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set in motion. The film is five years old and sounds more and more true every day. It's the best description of the post-punk anger I've seen. It is also one of my 10 best favorite movies.
