David Zucker has directed one of the funniest comedies of the year with this silly farce. Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends on a lot of sophisticated gags, but it's always fun, unlike some recent comic efforts. The movie is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from blatantly obvious to the most subtle, in which you must pay attention to everything that appears in the frame or, probably, you will lose them. Like his previous efforts, which include "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun", humor flies almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it is easy to overlook the few that fall. What distinguishes this film from other pale imitations in the parody genre is that it has a real story. While others have relied on making fun of too many famous scenes in movies almost at random (take "Mafia!", Please), this film tells a new story with nice characters. He plays sports movies in general and satirizes the real sports industry instead of cheating specific movies. Even for people who do not care about "South Park", its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of lead actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos from athletes, sports announcers and other celebrities, especially a little hilarious with Robert Stack's "Unsolved Mysteries". By the way, stay with the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved, in words perhaps by applying to the sports mix of the film, a dunk at home.
