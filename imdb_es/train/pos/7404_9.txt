I just watched the Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The program notes said it was - A perfect delight - made, moving, funny, dramatic and movingly significant. I could not agree more. I just hope that the rest of the Festival films reach this level of entertainment and I hope to see more Chinese films planned to be screened in Sydney in the coming months.
