"Kalifornia" is a good odyssey of suspense and terror of Hollywood that speaks of two couples traveling to California across the country to share the cost of gasoline: a pair of losers (Lewis and Pitt) and two wannabee artists, a photographer and a writer. (Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt "nails" his character, which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller. A good watch for those in the psycho-killer.
