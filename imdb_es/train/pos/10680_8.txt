As is almost always the case, when Britain presents an entertaining and / or successful question and answer program, the Yanks will appear and steal the format and produce their own, far inferior version. The Man About the House, of course, is not an exception to that rule. The version of the Yankees (Three's Company) was unappealable, brain head paper that seems to work forever. An excellent example of quantity over quality (nonexistent). The original, on the other hand, is a lovingly remembered gem that had the ability (like Fawlty Towers) to disconnect at the precise moment (unlike the 637 episodes of "hilarity" invented by the Company of Three). Jo was cute, there was a brilliant chemistry among the Ropers, Richard O'Sullivan made everything look so easy, the scripts, although they were not exactly Oscar Wilde's standard, they were always fun and Chrissy was the most beautiful woman who has walked the Face of this planet from the Dead Sea simply felt bad. 'Nuff said.
