This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave, pretending that you know or care what communism was about and what the Russians or the British are like, if you accept and do not mind conventions, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, touching and funny. Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely overtaken by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does a good job too. The final is moving, and logical - movie logic, of course. It's worth seeing, if you accept the rules of the game.
