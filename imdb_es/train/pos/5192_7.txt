I'm a fan of kung fu, but I'm not a fan of Woo. I'm not interested in gangster movies full of exaggerated weapon games. Now, martial arts; *that is beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here by producing a very entertaining kung fu movie, which has almost * too much * fight, if such a thing is possible! This is good. <br /> <br /> Many of the fight scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are fun and enjoyable. The bad guys are a little too unbelievably bad, but, nevertheless, they are entertaining. You have to see the sleeping magician! He can only fight when he is asleep, he is hysterical! <br /> <br /> When you see it repeatedly, however, Last Hurray For Chivalry can get a little boring and a lot of breath, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not so good. Therefore, I qualify it as "only" with a 7 out of 10. But in reality it is almost an "8". <br /> <br /> In summary, one of the best kung fu movies, made in the heart. of the best of kung fu cinema. All really good kung fu movies are from the mid to late seventies, with some notable exceptions from the late sixties and early seventies (and early eighties, to be fair).
