I enjoyed the movie and would suggest anyone to go out and have a good time. Do not take the film too seriously because you remember that it is Disney and it is classified as G. It is good to have fun, although adults can recognize some parts, but children will never notice it, especially the "triangle" between Cruella, Le Pelt and the faithful of Cruella. valet alonso Glenn Close is fantastic and has really made Cruella her own and she is incredibly terrifying, even when she is "cured" of her love forms, she can instill fear in the audience with her highs that literally shake the theater. (I even found myself jumping in my seat when he catches you by surprise with his 'bipolarity' like the dog that loves Ella). In general, I will see him again in theaters, I found myself enjoying it a lot.
