Well, this show is nothing but AWESOME! It has a great story and plot and great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is very good and is perfect for the role! He is gunna to be great in Hollywood. He has a bright future ahead! This program will last a lot longer because I really love this program, and I hope it is very successful! It's so interesting. I've been waiting for it to come out for around 6 or 7 months and it's finally here, and it's great! I also record it. I can see it whenever I want now! Too bad it's only once a week. I wish I was on at least twice a week because now I would like it to be Tuesday every day! I hope everyone likes this show! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
