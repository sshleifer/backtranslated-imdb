I love this movie, but I can not understand what's in this movie, that's not to like. People who do not like this movie should be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe that Mr. Carrey is behind all that makeup. And I'm sure that most of the actors and actresses of the film have made movies before this. And there is a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Who. As it opens, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And it causes a bit of fun for whos in Whoville. Sicne we know that those who love Christmas. While the Grinch does not like Christmas. And he even makes fun of little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the city's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the voice of the narrator is made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is chosen as the mayor of Whoville. Who does not like to talk about the Grinch near the Christmas season.
