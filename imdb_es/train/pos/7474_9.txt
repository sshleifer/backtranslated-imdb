This is one of those movies that is difficult to review without revealing the plot. Suffice it to say that there are strange and unexpected twists, beyond the initial superficial plot of "Tom Cruise is screwed with several women." <br /> <br /> The quality of the cast elevates this film above the norm, and the whole cast adapts well to its parts: Cruise as the irritating and conceited playboy who has it all, and then loses it all, Diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged lover, Cruz as the new exotic girl on the scene and Russell as the fatherly psychologist. The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense and science fiction and is generally an entertaining journey. <br /> <br /> I must add that the photography is also excellent and the insertion of several visual metaphors. It is beautiful once you realize what is happening. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy well-performed movies with twists and turns, and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastical Philip K Dick style resolution, then this is a must. . <br /> <br /> 9/10
