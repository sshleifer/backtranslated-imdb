Henry Fool is a better movie. But this is the perfect way to follow a movie like 'Henry Fool'. Take Henry very seriously, his 'lies' and his mysterious aura. Even the first shot of 'Henry Fool' when Simon puts his ear to the ground when Henry comes walking down the hill manifests itself most completely through 'Fay Grim'. The jokes about the top, which are more or less meta-jokes (about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves), are good, but the opening of the film is a bit saturated in them. In addition, Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is discordant, yes, it is intention, but he feels forced and overused, it goes beyond the jarring, what I would call annoying. It's a flawed movie, but a must-see for any fan of Hartley or "Henry Fool." <br /> <br /> And do not listen to stupid comments, do not look at this unless you've seen the first movie. The intrigue, satire and wit of this movie are totally lost if you have not seen Henry Fool. It is a sequel. That is simply silly.
