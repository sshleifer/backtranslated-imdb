This movie has a powerful philosophical ending. But that ending only makes sense if you watch the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The alienation of young people at the end of the 60s, from the point of view of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious subject of "Zabriskie Point". Backed by pricing. Mark Freche promover and Daria Halprin did not miss a terminalollaED Emotional considerate ojos, a crane thatgine the Animals inches. Having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism, as both players seem emotionally separated from the turmoil that surrounds them. <br /> <br /> This is not a film guided by scripts. With the exception of the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with impressive cinematography. The beautiful naturalistic images seem from another world, and perfectly synchronized with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria. <br /> <br /> I would have replaced the weakly weak music of Pink Floyd with the most compelling music of The Doors. Many scenes claim for "Riders On The Storm". <br /> <br /> Even so, I like this movie. Is different; It's unique; It is artistic and imaginative. And the wastelands of the desert are beautiful. <br /> <br /> As the years go by, "Zabriskie Point" seems increasingly attractive. It transmits the mood of the late 1960s in America. It is amazingly artistic, in a bohemian way. And the last eight minutes of the film are fascinating and philosophically fascinating.
