This is not the typical Mel Brooks movie. It was much less slapstick than most of his films and he actually had a plot that could be followed. Leslie Ann Warren made the film, she is such a fantastic and underestimated actress. There were some moments that could have developed a bit more, and some scenes that could have probably been cut to make space to do it, but in general, it's worth paying the price to rent it and see it. The performance was good in general, Brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking directly with the audience. Once again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but "Fume" and "Sailor" played their roles well.
