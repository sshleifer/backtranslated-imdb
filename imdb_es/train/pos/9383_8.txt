From the director of the films 'Last Seduction' and 'Kill me again', another film comes in the noir style. John Dahl created a niche for himself by making films about the subjects of adultery, blackmail in the early 90's. Although he did not have much opinion regarding the latest seduction. But nowadays, Mr. Dahl has resorted to directing television programs. It's a shame because the man had talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** This is a pretty impressive movie that revolves around a vagabond cage) that comes to the city of Wyoming for a job. However, he has no luck and is mistaken for a hitman from Texas for the bar owner J.T Walsh. He is given the task of killing his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to split after taking the payment in advance without doing so. When leaving the city, he accidentally hits a guy on the road, whom he then takes to the local hospital. At that time, Cage agrees again with Walsh, who also appears to be the local sheriff. After that, Cage escapes his clutches, but meets the real killer who is Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl co-wrote and directed this film. Therefore, it shows that a project can be decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen. The direction is of good level, however, while I watch the movie, I have a TV movie feel. There were too many frames up close. However, this does not prevent the film from being a pleasant experience. The film had a good rhythm and the structure was perfect. Dahl wrote the script with a good length. <br /> <br /> Cage interpreted the role as a drifter realistically, although for me his performance seemed somewhat moderate. His facial expressions were in the mark. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale. His hairstyle was far away and can make any man kneel. Hopper did his part well. But I feel that it was a mistake for this role. He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit man. The role was not written with his personality in mind. <br /> <br /> When you see one, you will get a deja vu from previous movies like 'The Hot Spot' and 'A Perfect Murder'. Due to the fact that some subplots are similar. In general, if you are a fan of noir movies, this is for you. It is worth recommending. 7/10
