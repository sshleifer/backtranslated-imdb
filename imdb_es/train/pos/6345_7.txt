Costumes and makeup were great, there were some exceptionally funny lines, and the paper was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey did the job as good as it could be given the script writing quite disappointing. Of course, this was mostly a children's movie, but if you're going to spend so much money on making a movie, you should at least give the story enough body to go beyond Dr. Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. It is worth seeing, but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a great classic, in any measure.
