<br /> <br /> Shot just after the war, this story was made to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. He ended up receiving the honor of being the first Royal Premiere after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that the film entangles the Royal Air Force, the psychology of Sigmund Freud, the founding fathers of America and others on the long stairs (special effects in childhood) and beyond of the celestial doors without losing anything of their integrity. <br /> <br /> Although it sounds absurd, this clever script guides and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and presents a charming facility rarely combined in film since then. <br /> <br /> Get ready to warm your heart with this sweet, innocent and charming love story. Roger Livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show! <br /> <br /> British cinema should cry when it remembers how good it was in those early post-war years. <br /> <br />
