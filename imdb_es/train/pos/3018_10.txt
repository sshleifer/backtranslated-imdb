This movie is an exception to the rule that a sequel is worse than the original. His comedy at its best. This movie is a fast action comedy where it seems that something happens every second. On more than one occasion, the entire audience laughed out loud at a joke. <br /> <br /> It is a great advantage to have seen the first movie, but it is not a requirement. <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta kanal 2 also has the advantage of being a parody in the last decades of reality production series as a survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish film for the Swedish public. Therefore, do not see it if you are not familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
