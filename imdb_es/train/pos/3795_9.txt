After watching this film at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to know how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q & A) about the film after which he presented his ironic situation: how to obtain distribution for a film that portrays minorities (women, not white) working on the resolution of controversial problems (teen pregnancy, adolescent motherhood , racial identity, etc.). homes of single mothers), and how to write a faithful script about all these subjects being a white man of the mid-thirties. The multiracial and multi-genre adult audience mostly commented on the fantastic story, the detailed characters and the fantastic depiction of the "real-life teenagers" of the film. However, most of the teenagers had left the building, which leads me to think that this is a film that adults with children see better, as a starting point for the debate, rather than, as many adults felt, "a movie that teenagers should see because it's about them. " Therefore, distribution questions: how can we have it in our hands? Internet (retailer) would be a big road, this is a movie that will be buried, like "Pups" or other radical movies for modern teenagers, and McKay seemed receptive. Regarding his credits as a writer / director, McKay was extremely sensitive and detailed in his work; He allied with the neighborhood of Crown Heights in which the film is developed, working with actors to portray the characters in their own vision of what they think they should be - with the results being very realistic.
