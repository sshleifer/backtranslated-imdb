['The most succinct way to describe Ride With The Devil is with one word: authenticity. I will not review what has already been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how appreciated was the historical research and the meticulous attention to detail that the team went through without a doubt. <br /><br /> As a history student familiar with the period and setting of this film, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fiction films regarding &quot;Kansas Bleeding.&quot; Yes, liberties were taken over real events, as it is likely to do all fiction. But the general feeling of the film is genuine. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (there is no retrospective view of PC here), even the actors seem authentic. Even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small part in the film) seemed to have formed a photograph of the mid-nineteenth century. <br /><br /> Some spectators with whom I spoke expressed their disbelief at the stylized dialogue. They can not believe that nineteenth-century farmers would &quot;speak like poets.&quot; <br /><br /> What they do not realize is that in this age of verbal babosity, the American public of the 19th century was a surprisingly cultured and eloquent group. These people were brought up in Shakespeare and the King James version of the Bible. The scriptwriters reconstructed the most probable verbal styles of these people, judging by the documentation of the time. The stylized dialogue adds to the magical atmosphere of the film. <br /><br /> But in addition to a historical document, this film also works viscerally. Beautifully photographed and made, it goes back to the days of the great Western epics. The raid in Lawrence, Kansas, performed so many times before in so many other minor films, is presented with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the middle of the action. <br /><br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This movie has everything a movie buff could want. <br /><br /> In a year that was dominated by overrated garbage such as American Beauty, this great work of art was buried by a system of indifferent study. But I&#39;m sure that Ride With The Devil will be delivered in the coming years. Please rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.']
