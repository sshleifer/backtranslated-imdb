I do not understand why they decided to release this film to present to the American audience the dynamo that is Jet Li. Legend's fist would have been a much better option. Anyway, Black Mask is not terrible, but it's certainly not great either. The final sequence of the fight is well organized by Yuen Woo Ping, who coordinated The Matrix. But the English release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I beg Hollywood studios to release these films without subtitles with subtitles.) Jet Li shows her characteristic charisma in the lead role and Francoise Yip has a fresh but brief role as the woman 701. <br /> <br /> Black The mask has a strange Gothic style that adds some interest, but is overburdened with battles and explosions of weapons. More attention to Li's fantastic physical abilities were in order. Black Mask is a decent movie, but do yourself a favor and buy Fist of Legend if you want to see a tremendous movie that really shows Li's abilities.
