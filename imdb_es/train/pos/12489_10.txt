First of all, no one can understand why this movie has such a bad rating. Not only is this the first really horrid movie for a long time to me, I'm pretty hard with a decades-old horror experience, starting with driving through dark rides (ghost trains) as a child. Secondly, the main actress Cheri Christian has a face that allows you to expect her to be the main actress in the main images of the future. Third, this woman is so tremendously beautiful that I suggest that the directors remove all those Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes, and how are the names of these ephemeral light bulbs. Mrs. Christian is not a light, but a sun. <br /> <br /> However, the "dark remains" also have a considerable metaphysical importance. The idea that photographs show creatures of the intermediary realm between reality and "imagination" that are not visible with their own eyes is not new. But I've never seen a movie before those creatures are visible in the photographs only for certain people and only at certain times. This means that the photo is not just an iconic image of reality (through which reality becomes a sign), but it becomes an alternative form of reality that can change as "real" reality can. Being a sign, the change of the image means that it influences the objects photographed, that is, the sign behaves like an object. Now, in our usual world of perception, it is common for objects to change their sign. For example, if someone grows a bird, his photograph will show him with a beard, not without, as he did before. But on the contrary, the change of objects by signs would imply that the photo with a beard is first and only then the beard grows in man. This is, very simply expressed, the case that happens with the photos taken by the main character in prison, in this film. This is new, and we should be grateful for everything new in horror films that, in general, only repeat and reorder the effects and functions that are already known, mainly from the moment of silence.
