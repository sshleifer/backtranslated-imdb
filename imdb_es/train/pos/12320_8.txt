Sinnui yauman, is undoubtedly one of the best ghost stories ever filmed. Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, A Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin, played by Leslie Cheung, is a young man with bad luck who goes in search of a monastery where to stay, deep in the forest, a place where the villagers seem to be very afraid to approach. The trip is only dangerous for the wolves, and a crazy Taoist monk lives in the temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing, a beautiful and mysterious young woman who also lives nearby in an abandoned temple. She is forced to seduce men by her evil lover, but when she meets the innocent Ling Choi Sin, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is a kind of clumsy fool but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the forest, he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the forest. There are great martial arts, even a monk who bursts into a drunken song while performing ritual Taoist sword forms. The film does a lot of traditional martial arts acrobatics, with magic and flying through the air, jumping from tree to tree, with elegant long dresses and scarves, but the film really flows, and everything is effective. <br /> <br /> Tsing must be married to a monster of the evil tree, which can not be good, and we feel his situation in his house where we find his sisters and his stepmother who really is not nice. <br /> <br /> In the end, they must fight against a tree witch with a deadly tongue, and go with Yin to the heart of hell to fight a thousand-year evil to save their souls, and carry the ashes of Ling to your home for a proper burial so you can have a chance to reincarnate. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really pays attention to details. This movie moves you in many ways, you will laugh, you will cry and you will only have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography. And although in the end, Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride into the morning sun under a lovely rainbow, we never know if Tsing received a reincarnation, but we do know her.
