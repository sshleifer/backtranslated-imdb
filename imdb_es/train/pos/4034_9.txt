Pinjar is a really good movie, with good acting, good narrative, good presentation, touching emotions, etc. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the quality of the films produced by Bollywood is improving a lot these days, and this movie is evidence. <br /> <br /> There is no Bollywood movie that can remember that I was so shocked. I was literally thinking about the film for hours, marveling at the various emotional situations that test the human being. A human. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the great performance of Urmilla Matondkar, and also some of Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in northern India at the bottom of the partition, and all problems seem sweet when compared to the problems she faces. <br /> <br /> A movie that has to be seen. A technically superior Bollywood product, which I think is comparable to the best films that come from other countries in the world.
