This movie is pretty corny, but at least I give credit when trying to provide some characterization of its principles. There are some great moments in the film and the dialogue also has great moments. <br /> <br /> The air assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I guess I really like the idea of ​​how long it will take a veteran for another veteran. Of course it is not so well done, but the premise is not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom
