A community pool in Connecticut is the setting for this "under the radar" movie that is charming, fun, entertaining and engaging. Although it won prizes at major film festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" was not released to a multitude of theaters across the United States, but was distributed on DVD and shown in theaters selectively. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that "The Big Bad Swim" has never had the advertising hype of a Hollywood release, considering how many sinkers Hollywood has released this year, like "I Know Who Killed Me". "The Big Bad Swim", a really good independent movie, has had to swim upriver on its own. <br /> <br /> However, in "The Big Bad Swim", actress Paget Brewster is endearing and believable like Amy. the math teacher from point to point of rupture that is not only being abandoned by her husband, but is also about to lose her job and ends up betting on a new life. TV actor Jeff Branson, who is HOT, plays Noah, the serious and vulnerable swimming teacher who roams the additional area to help his students overcome their fears, and discovers that he can learn from his students. The beautiful and sexy Jess Weixler (did I just see her in a commercial bank?) Skillfully interprets Jordan, the future swimmer who works in two jobs, one as a bar dancer and the other as a blackjack dealer. His character provides the catalyst for the change between the set, but it is the least understandable of the characters, due to the lack of a "background story" or the motivation of why he does what he does. Jordan is young enough to live at home with a younger brother, omnipresent and with a video camera that spies on her. However, it does not show that his parents are involved with his life in any way, which seems strange. There is not a drunk mother or an abusive parent here to explain why a normal, attractive girl from a Connecticut suburb would choose to be a pole dancer who will self-medicate and delight with single singles. <br /> <br /> Despite this objection, "The Big Bad Swim" is successful, in large part, because it is a happy movie, of feeling good. <br /> <br /> As one might expect, learning to swim is the metaphor of life. Ultimately, it's better to jump with both feet and go for a swim, instead of sitting on the deck, because life happens to you anyway. <br /> <br /> The Big Bad Swim is a great dating movie, a great bedroom movie, a great "what I have not seen" movie, and men like it as much as women.
