The acting in this movie was excellent. As an amateur rocker, I found very few mistakes. As a human being, he touched my heart and soul. To see the actors, you would think they are the real characters. Laura Dern, one of my favorite actresses, did not leave anything out of her performance. The young actors who played the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired that eternal love / hate relationship between father and son to make him feel real. If you do not have a lump in your throat or a tear falls when the first successful rocket goes up or when the father and son come to an agreement, then they will check your pulse (it is possible that you are dead).
