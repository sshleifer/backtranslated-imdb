Well, that was a pretty good episode. Much better than the credit you receive. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is splendid. Better yet I love that final shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great and the guest cast (minus the helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this episode is that many things remain unexplained. Why does sex change? What is the purpose? and are they extraterrestrials? what type? Why were they never shown again in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I give this episode a high of THREE stars. One of my favorites yet, but the holes in the plot bother me. Still ... I'm not going to let it ruin my entertainment.
