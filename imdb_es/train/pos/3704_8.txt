In general, it is difficult to qualify these films as cut and paste. Some of the segments can be quite good, while others reduce the overall product rating. In this, for example, the scene of the girls in the doctor's office was quite exciting ... one of the best in the visualization history (limited) of this viewer. Then there is the segment of Asia ... the lady is always entertaining. And the story that unites the whole was an interesting concept. The exchange scene that closes the offer is not bad either. Technically, the production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
