The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations of what Greene wrote; for example, the silent but somber humor that bursts into the scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or the obsession of a murdered child that seizes something of the plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to ridicule. <br /> <br /> However, I do not want to suggest that the movie is bad in any way. The part always seems and the story remains in the mind as a good 'un. Some of the secondary characters were value actors who could change their hand to anything. <br /> <br /> It's a real pity that the movie is not available on DVD.
