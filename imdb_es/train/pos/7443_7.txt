An old saying says: "If you think you have problems, visit a hospital." That has been updated in recent years to "If you think you have problems, watch a television show ... especially Jerry Springer's!" This movie is one of those that is so bad, it's good! That's why I gave him a seven, it's fine, but not great. It's a great way to lose 95 minutes, just as the daily talk show is advertised as "an hour of your life you'll never come back!" All family topics are here ... unfaithful husbands / boyfriends, the wildest audience on television, women with Jerry, etc. The surprise was seeing Molly Hagan, who usually plays sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head") playing The mother of trailer-trash and Jaime Pressly ("My name is Earl") as her daughter also trash, doing favors for almost all the men with whom they had contact. The men (including the producer of the staff) presented themselves as lunkheads par excellence who deserved what they got. I do not want to ruin or reveal everything, but the movie plays like the daily program. Here in Phoenix, he shows up back to back for two hours each morning and, after that, everything else seems to pale. Once again, I give this movie a seven ... it's good, but not excellent. Jerry Springer is best taken in small doses of one hour.
