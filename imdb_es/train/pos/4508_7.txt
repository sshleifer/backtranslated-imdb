I was impressed by the beautiful photograph of this film, which was filmed in Alaska. Although technically it is a melodrama, we see many activities in which Eskimos participate, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes archival footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear-projection scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating. Spearfishing salmon, walrus hunting, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale sometimes seemed like a documentary. There was no distribution list, which reinforced the documentary flavor. The filmmakers tried to make it look very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was translated by someone on the screen or by intertitles. The introduction indicated that, with the exception of white merchants and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two main characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but they were professional actors with credits for previous films and you could see that sometimes they had makeup. But they were excellent in their roles and continued to have careers in Hollywood. In short, the movie is definitely worth seeing.
