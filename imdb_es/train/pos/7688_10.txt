Back in '74, Eric Monte made the classic T. Good Times television show. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching the Reruns in T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Rolle. Most of the time, John Amos felt a little jealous of the popularity of Jimmie Walker, who won millions of fans to sit and watch Good Times. The show would have died if JJ had not been there to save him with his usual attitude Kool Aid. Drinking KOOL HELP was like your favorite thing in the program. He had 3 when he left and 8 when he finished. Instead of 1974-1979, it should have lasted longer, like in the 1980s, when it was growing.
