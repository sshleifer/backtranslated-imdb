Intriguing. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that only touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the great LOST story that is told. <br /> <br /> From acting to the rare visual effects, LOST is the essential television program for science fans. -fiction, fantasy, action, adventure and much and much mystery. <br /> <br /> Each member of the cast is so well chosen and is so good in their roles, that you love them, hate them, or deserve them frankly that they are dead. <br /> <br /> Visual effects, when used (which is rare) are really well done considering the usual production of shows. Be it the "smoke monster", for polar bears, LOST is credible in terms of eye candy. <br /> <br /> As far as history is concerned, nothing can compare with the vast complexity that this spectacle has made viewers like. I stand it From start to finish, the continuity is virtually perfect, the characters develop and the story in constant evolution slowly responds to the questions that many crave. <br /> <br /> In general, there are virtually no defects in LOST. It makes for dramatic / sci-fi television what Arrested Development did for comedy: it has set the bar. <br /> <br /> I STRONGLY recommend those who are patient, intellectual and love every moment of the trip. It does not matter how long it takes to get to the end. <br /> <br /> See this program.
