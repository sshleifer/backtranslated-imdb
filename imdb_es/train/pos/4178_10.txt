['This film is a true reflection of the Australian ingenuity that has been required to make this country what it is for the last 200 years. Not pompous like the British, not Gung-Ho like the Americans. If any of those countries had tried what this crew did, it would have failed miserably. Either because of ignorance on the part of the British, or too much faith in the superior firepower on the American side. The &quot;real&quot; Australians (that is, those who do not matter) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult life. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Pascual Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.']
