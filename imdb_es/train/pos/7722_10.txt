['This is a movie that has it all, the handsome hero, the beautiful damsel in distress, the noble figure with the tragic flaw and a truly wonderful robot. Forbidden Planet has maintained that special magic over the years and does not lose its flavor with repeated visits (although the sexual attractiveness of the young Anne Francis helps considerably in that regard). <br /><br /> Movie fans will recognize the young Leslie Nielsen who plays the handsome and heroic Commander Adams, although those of us who have become fond of him in comic roles may be surprised by his appearance in a serious role. The distinguished and noble Walter Pidgeon is also a prominent player as the scientist with a secret (Id). Other supporting actors deserve a nod, especially Warren Stevens as the ingenious and ingenious &quot;Doc&quot;, and of course the charms of Miss Francis, as noted above. <br /><br /> This film was a pioneer in the use of electronic music, in the 1950s, nothing less. The credits call them &quot;tonalities&quot;, but those of us who try to mix the first versions of the device &quot;Theremin&quot; will recognize the mysterious and creepy moans and squeals that are sometimes used in the soundtrack. Even so, it lends itself to the image of the exotic and strange landscape of the mysterious and prohibitive world of the Krell. <br /><br /> The special effects are also quite striking. I remember my fear when I was a young man waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible &quot;Id&quot; monster, and when he finally visualized himself in the only battle scene, he literally shook my feet with amazement and amazement. The magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of Krell&#39;s scientific complex as the characters make their way through several mazes and passageways, guided by the enigmatic Dr. Morbius. <br /><br /> I remember feeling some jealousy that Dr. Morbius had such a great toy in the form of Robby the Robot. Robby&#39;s person is quite charming and somehow seems more human than some of the other characters. Spectators of follow-up shows such as Twilight Zone and Lost In Space will recognize Robby&#39;s recycled support in some of those episodes, although I remember that he never had the &quot;personality&quot; of the original Robby. <br /><br /> I must admit that I did not fully understand the intricacies of the plot until I was old enough to understand the various references to Freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage that we carry within, but we have trained ourselves themselves, through willpower. , submerge and control by adhering to social codes. Although the key to the story seems obvious once it was revealed, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately ignored) by Dr. Morbius until Commander Adams, who thinks clearly, forces Dr. Morbius to face the evil within himself. same. I still get goose bumps when Commander Adams pushes Dr. Morbius towards the Krell machine that gave him a superior intellect, which opened the floodgates of his subconscious to the power of the Krell machine: &quot;Here. His mind, artificially enlarged, consciously, he still lacked the power to operate the Great Machine, but your subconscious had been strengthened enough. &quot; Zowee! <br /><br /> Forbidden Planet is still probably my favorite science fiction movie, and it remains timeless and classic because of its carefully crafted story and its wonderful visualization and realization on the screen.']
