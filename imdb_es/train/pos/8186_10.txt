I love the pit of Satan! David Tennant is a great actor and also Billie Piper. Who else loves Will Thorp in pieces? He is so cute, is not he? He hated the parts where he was possessed by the devil and where he was told to "go to hell," as Rose put it bluntly. Of course, it was very funny when he said: "Rose, do us a favor, do you want? Shut up!" Mr. Jefferson was so brave, was not he? Die to save others. I felt very sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he came out of possession for the second time because he was very scared. I was like, "Oh, my God, if I were Rose, I'd be so scared for him." And when she hugged him I was like "grrrrrr, he's mine! Get out your hands!" But I thought it was very sweet. And the doctor ... well, I thought I was going to tell Ida "tell Rose I love her", but she did not. Oh good.
