Another powerful girl movie. This time, it revolves around Diana Gusman, who is always fighting at school. Instead of being expelled, she takes her anger to another side, to the boxing ring. She trains to be a boxer and there she meets Adrian's featherweight and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a powerful message of carrying your dreams and going with them, even if someone does not believe in you (in this case, your father does not believe in it). That alone makes the movie worthwhile. Enjoy
