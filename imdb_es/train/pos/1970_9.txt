['Finally, after years of waiting for a new movie to continue the sexual chaos of &quot;Basic Instinct,&quot; we got a great sequel that contains the right elements for a franchise like this! I remember everything about the original, the steam, the romance, the sex, the interrogation, the music (of the teacher Jerry Goldsmith) and everything else, from violence and murder, to intense confrontations of all kinds! Make no mistake, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; was a real winner for audiences around the world. I can remember in 2001, when we received the news of a sequel of this type. Five years later, we have it. I would never have thought of it to end like this. When an abandoned project was declared, time could not tell if it was ever a real possibility to start. Well, I guess now we know that everything is possible in this case. Even if the original director or writer is not present, all we need is the attractive and reliable Sharon Stone, and we have a deal made! Please listen to me ... <br /><br /> When people say that this movie is bad, I think it&#39;s only due to the fact that the style is extreme and a little outdated. I use the word &quot;dated&quot; only because we have not seen a similar film in many years, and audiences have adapted to the boring and pointless narrative seen in other movies that really make money, and the only reason why they do it. The big numbers are because those movies are familiar. Who needs a hole and clean? Of course it&#39;s a nice thing to have, but come on! Escapism is very rare these days, and &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot; gives real fans what we&#39;ve been waiting for. This film is not an Academy Award winner, nor does it try to be. It simply gives the fans what they have been waiting for. It&#39;s a movie to have fun. Today&#39;s movies seem to be taken too seriously, but this movie is simply fun and does not take itself seriously, either anyway. That said, I&#39;m going to evaluate the movie. <br /><br /> The film is a fast-paced movie from the first second, as we see Cathernine Tremell in a car, accelerating to 110 MPH, and enjoying lustful emotions in doing so. Maybe sex and driving do not mix, because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and ... well, she escapes unharmed, but her partner is not doing too well. Once again, Tremell is the main suspect in the accident and will be subjected to analysts and psychiatrists. Dr. Michael Glass (Morrissey) is automatically attracted to her from the first moment he meets her. Like another criminal investigator before him, he is fascinated and seduced, slowly and surely. Her denial of everything begins to crumble around her while she weaves a spell, only she has the power to do so. Possibly, Tramell is more dangerous now than before, but like the first, we&#39;ll never know, right? Once the seduction is in motion, jealousy, rage, drugs and a lot of erotic scenarios occur. <br /><br /> This film does not recycle the first, but briefly mentions the incidents of the previous films from time to time. This is a good thing. It allows us, as a public, to know that the script has been written so that the level goes up one level or two. Sharon Stone dazzles us again, as if 14 years had not passed. His second career of the deceitful novelist is right in the place as before. Simply amazing! David Morrissey is fine, and he manages quite well. The fact that a non-popular star was chosen makes his performance much more pleasant because we, as a public, have no record of him, only what we see he does. My last thought was 8.5 to 9 out of 10. So it&#39;s not the first, nor can it be up to the first prize-winning place. However, it can meet the standards set by the first film, and yes, the people! He does it.']
