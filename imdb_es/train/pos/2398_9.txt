I really enjoy this movie. She took a rather obscure story, that of Shakespeare's Macbeth, and wrapped it in a peculiar modern yarn, often funny and touching. Scotland together under one roof. Opposite worlds act to highlight the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love Harold Perrineau as the Chorus, a part that does not exist in the play but really helps jazz. above. The ending stands out among the little Indians I've seen for its closure and originality.
