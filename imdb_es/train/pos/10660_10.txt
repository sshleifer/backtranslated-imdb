I found that this movie was suspense almost from the beginning. When Miss Stanwyck begins her narrative, there are only a few minutes left before she realizes that problems are coming. The deserted area, the lock on the door of the deserted service station, everything prepares you to wait for it ... here it comes. At first you think it will be about the child, but very soon you begin to hold your breath watching the tide. I thought that this movie was very stressful, although I had seen it before and was ready for the outcome. Now, a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you've seen it before deserves some kind of special rating, maybe a white-knuckled prize?
