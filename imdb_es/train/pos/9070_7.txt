It started slowly after an excellent animated introduction, since the director had a lot of characters and a school environment to develop. However, once the bet is placed, the movie speeds up, as it is a race against time to see if you can eat a certain amount of worms before 7 pm. On the way home, we had a good opportunity to discuss some things with our son: bullies, help others, mind about the matter when he does not want to do something. <br /> <br /> Of special interest is the girl who played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director insults her unexpectedly, and when she is on the screen she is captivating. She is one of those "Hey, looks familiar" faces, and then I remembered that she was the girl that Pepsi introduced about 8 years ago. She was also in "Paulie", that movie about the parrot trying to find its way home. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Eisenberg made many appearances on television and movies in '99 -00, but then she did not see much in the next few years. She is now 14 years old and is growing up to be a beautiful woman. His smile really heats the screen. If you can get some better roles, you could have a career as good (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, another child actor with three names, but hopefully without some of the problems in which Osment has been lately. <br /> <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8 year old son, who just read the story, the film did not seem to follow the book so well, but it was entertaining. The end of the film seemed like a great setup for some sequels (How to eat the boiled slugs? Escargot's style for kids?), Which might not be so bad. It was nice to take the family to see a movie and not have to worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of the film was the respect / fear generated by the director, Mr. Burdock. (Boiler). Today's movies tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons. While he has a ridiculous scene in particular, he ruled the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin working a bit.
