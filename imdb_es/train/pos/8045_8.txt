Finally I settled in the mail order DVD rental to find movies that are not available to me in stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni, and I also like small films, often ignored. <br /> <br /> This is a delight! Meloni has a lot of charm in this part. It's easy to pigeonhole him: you only see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is a middle-aged, non-committal person who is hitting the skates in many ways, only to find a way to happiness in someone unexpected. <br /> <br /> The relationship established between Barry (Meloni) and the character of Tim Busfield is realistic and has not ended. I have not seen Busfield for 30 years, and it was fun to watch. But it was the whole Chris movie. I became a fan again. <br /> <br /> At the beginning it's a bit slow, I admit it. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could have been edited. But in general, this movie will enchant you, either male or female, as it has an honest and refreshing view of current relationships.
