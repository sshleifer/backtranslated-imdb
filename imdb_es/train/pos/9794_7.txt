I thought the movie could be a bit more complex, maybe in a psychological sense, but the action and the voice acting were first class. The animation was heavy CG in many scenes, but very good at that. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever movies, which includes romances and Wayne's conflicts and reasons for dating. The 007 fans would love this, and also the women, a great song! Wayne was very well represented in this film, and Penquin returned to his true form, there were no mutant genes in him this time! I liked the fact that Robin was not used too much, Tim Drake was just a good nerd of the computer, something like an Indigo child or a mind of the future. The stars, the decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the voice actors as well. Kelly Ripa was very funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> I then qualify the Phantom, the Return of the Joker and Batman against Dracula, but I liked the script smarter than Subzero's. 7/10
