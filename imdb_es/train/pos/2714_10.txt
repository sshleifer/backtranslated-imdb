['This was one of those wonderful rare moments on television that I wished I had captured forever on VHS. Will it not be ventilated again? <br /><br /> It was very creative and I remember that it was broadcast once a week and the wait for the next episode was unbearable. I want to see everything again. I want to buy it. I want what I can not have. Not even on EBAY. <br /><br /> So, having said enough, it was one of the best series of the 80s. It should be considered a classic but lost in space. At least this website and Wikipedia mention it. Sob. <br /><br /> It was absolutely attractive, fun, flirtatious and original. Maybe not like the original Sherlock Holmes, actually I think that Quintin is much more attractive and has a better chance with his protagonist than Holmes could never.']
