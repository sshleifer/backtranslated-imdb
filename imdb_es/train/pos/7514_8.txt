She is not Michael Jordan. <br /> <br /> Think of all the wonderful NBA players whose career light has dimmed for no reason other than the moment of their birth. Their names could stumble into the public's mouth as easily as Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, and the list goes on; but the volume has dropped a bit, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other great players who always lost Michael's headlines. <br /> <br /> I've seen it written that Gretchen Mol's career shot up in the wake of the cover story in the Vanity Fair number of 1998, which predicted the inevitable superstar of Ms. Mol. Later it was said that it had been exaggerated. I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that, sometime after having seen "The Devil's Advocate" in '97 or '98, I would be confused as to which actress played Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mol or Theron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was "2 Days in the Valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol was in "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> By the time I had seen "The Thirteenth Floor" (Mol) and "Sweet November" (Theron), I had practically straightened them out, but I still put them in the same mental filing cabinet. Both were very talented, they had sweet faces, similar body types, short blond hair and so on. <br /> <br /> However, Theron was offered more work. He loved her like Sara Deever and like Adele Invergordon her beauty was absolutely intimidating. <br /> <br /> In 2003 "Monster" was released and from that moment until the delivery of the Oscar, everyone knew who was the "Best Actress Award". And deservedly! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made Aileen Wuornos a real tick would be to somehow reproduce the digital video stuck in Selby's head. And for a great talent to become physically unattractive! Unheard! <br /> <br /> Then, in 2005, "The Notorious Bettie Page" was launched. Mol's performance was extraordinary. Maybe she was standing in the shadow of Mrs. Theron. It was like the ballroom for the celebration of the victory of the losing presidential candidate, nobody came and nobody cared. It was seen as a continuation of an old story, once the promising actress with a declining career plays a nudie role in a "B" movie. Ho hum! No no no! Incorrect! No matter what you think about the movie (and I like the films of the fifties), if you transmit it, you will miss one of the best performances of that year. Mrs. Moll was as Bettie as Mrs. Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately, Aileen, for the audience that goes to the movies, is the most sympathetic character. For whatever reason, an amoral and sociopathic murderer is less embarrassing to us than a naive, unsophisticated, uninhibited and religious girl, whose most serious crime was to live her life totally confident and completely exposed. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. His photos and movies are never sexual, they are never pornographic, but he presented himself as a caricature of everything evil. There was no sense of realism, only parody. Ms. Moll captured the very essence of the character. She gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally thin figure and when she posed for several photographers in the movie, her body was from Bettie. His total lack of inhibitions in the front fits perfectly with everything that has been published about Bettie. Film nudity usually represents eroticism or sexuality. In this film it is about innocence. Seeing Gretchen / Bettie naked did not make me want to jump on her, but instilled in me the desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other. If you pass this movie, you will miss one of the best performances of recent years. By the way, shame on the MPAA for giving it a rating of R.
