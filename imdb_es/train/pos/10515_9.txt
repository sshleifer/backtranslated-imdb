A small light and charming film, without a doubt, but a magnificently elaborated one. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this showcase early for her British accent, and the cast gathered around her and all the dialogue. This came at the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I do not know why that subject attracted Oscar's attention. Emma is the most accessible and least congested story of Jane Austen, told well.
