This first version of the story 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this film, he plays a double role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old movie when he sees them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold: the gold he needs to woo a countess who previously saved from drowning. <br /> <br /> Moving at an accelerated pace (the film lasts for just over an hour) and pretty well written and characterized, "The Prague Student" has echoes of the legend of Faust and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, beginning as he does with a pact with a mysterious figure of bad potential, and developing the good and bad sides of the same person.
