This movie is a large document. Follow the rap group, NWH, consisting of Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def, through their unique path to gangster rap high, low and back to highs. Through the problems with women, egos, police and whites, this group reaches the top of the rap world of gang members, as this film reaches the top of the mocumentaries. I know that Everybodies favorite is This is Spinal Tap, for very good reasons, however, I think that if he is in a good mood, this movie is simply better. Laughter never ends, even for someone who is not in rap culture. <br /> <br /> I am a white boy, who has no interest in rap music, culture or anything else related to it, however, I love this movie. . Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the script, the songs and starred in it, showed great potential and it's a pity I have not seen him since Fear of a Black Hat. However, I've seen it once more than you, and that's it, I recommend Fear of a Black Hat so you can laugh quickly. <br /> <br /> Remember, "Do not shoot at yourself to see the Whites ... of your eyes ... No, do not shoot, see the whites." <br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the movie.
