I like my scripts and ornaments Ronald Colman, the guy you see in movies like If I Were King and Kismet. I like him as the epitome of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. A meditabundo colman is not one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> But in A Double Life, precisely because his role as actor Anthony John is so unconventional for him, Colman was recognized with an Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. It became his best-known part. <br /> <br /> Colman is an actor who really takes the Method quite seriously. He just finished a successful career in a manners comedy and is a jovial guy. For a change of pace now that that play has ended his career on Broadway, Colman is bringing a rebirth from Othello to New York. The most opposite to a part you can get. <br /> <br /> His protagonist in both is his ex-wife, Signe Hasso, who loves him very much, but can not accept his mood change when he is at work. Colman loves her very much and wants her back. But he goes to a mental crisis when he begins to get confused with the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with his role of Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters, like a poor waitress who runs into a depressed colman, gets in the way. Of her madness and she ends up like poor Desdemona in the play. Murdered in the same way and now it's a matter of homicide cop Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Colman's performance is so good that one wonders if this is a job risk with the actors. I would shudder to think that yes, if there were unresolved homicides on or near Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, then they rehearsed Othello. <br /> <br /> I could never buy the story for that reason, but I certainly applaud Ronald Colman and what he did with the part. I'm sure there was a bit of regret for winning the Oscar, because one of the other nominees was his good friend William Powell for Life With Father. Others in the race that year were Gregory Peck for Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield for Body and Soul and Michael Redgrave for Mourning Becomes Electra. <br /> <br /> Colman gets support from the rest of the cast, including Edmond O'Brien who finds himself in the unwanted part of Cassio in Colman's jealous fantasy. You still will not find an equivalent of Iago in A Double Life, no one who insists on jealousy, everything is in your own mind. <br /> <br /> And that of one of the most cultured and civilized minds of the last century.
