The first time I saw Buster Keaton's first feature film and I have to admit that I really liked it and I just wish I had found it years ago. Rohauer's propaganda initially warns that the unique nitrate imprint of the Three Ages was rediscovered and recovered in 1954 just in time before combustion, and many frames that looked hopelessly stuck were separated. Therefore, it is a difficult place to see in places, but I have seen and survived much worse. <br /> <br /> It would have been fine as the 3 short films, but as a version of Intolerance is inventive and fun from the beginning the end: In the Stone Age with the evil Wallace Beery riding an elephant and a good Buster riding a pet brontosaurus; In Roman times Buster riding a car with wheels and adapted for sledding, the signs of No parking in Latin; In this Age of Speed ​​Need and Greed, your technological car falls beautifully to pieces in the first hump. Both he and Beery persecute La Niña throughout the centuries, an endless struggle. Favorite bit: like the caveman, he is knocked back on a cliff edge, but he still blows a kiss to the camera: an incredible second or two! <br /> <br /> Great things, reaffirming my love for silent film comedy.
