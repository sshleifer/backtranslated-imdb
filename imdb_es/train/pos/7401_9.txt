I found it very interesting that the film really managed to close the gap between my own American culture and that of the creators, that is, the Chinese one. It becomes a story about values, and makes the observer reevaluate his own choices in life and loyalties towards institutions. Surprisingly, he managed to do this in a gentle way, with a bit of humor, which only in retrospect seems to threaten the status quo. I enjoyed the movie, and I would see it again if I could.
