With a simplistic story and a captivating heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all. John Carpenter gives life to a nightmare that makes you nail-suck on Halloween night, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in his debut, defining role of the race) and his naughty friends plan a night of furtive fun, just to cross with a relentless psychopath from hell. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers has escaped from a close-insane aslyum ... after murdering his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now back in Haddonfield, the quiet city of Illinois where the murder was committed. Once he sets his eyes on Laurie after she leaves him a package to the abandoned house where he lived, he begins to stalk her and terrorize her, turning his night of amusement into terror as he stops anyone in his path to reach her. br /> <br /> The beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this whimsical horror movie scary ... with the long and somber shots, it feels constantly as if being stalked by the maniac serial killer. Myers is well hidden until it is fully revealed in the exciting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" is certainly obsolete, it is no less chilling. The idea alone induces goose bumps, and this little surprise is one of the most famous and memorable horror films that have been made so far ... it generated seven sequels and, finally, the equally frightening new version of Rob Zombie, and set a new standard for horror. that still exists today.
