['Is it a good idea to use live animals for shop windows? <br /><br /> No, and here&#39;s why ... <br /><br /> In &quot;Hare Conditioned,&quot; the sale that Bugs is helping to promote is over and the store manager (Nelson) is transferring it to a new department: taxidermy. Naturally, Bugs objects and the fun begins. <br /><br /> By using almost all the departments of the store (children&#39;s clothing, sports, shoes, costumes, women&#39;s nightgowns, do not ask), Bugs appears at all times, even referring to the manager as &quot;The Great GilderSNEEZE&quot;. Even when they are trapped in the confines of an elevator, Bugs makes the best of the situation. <br /><br /> Director Jones is at the top of his pictorial game as always, as do Blanc (as Bugs, natch) and Nelson (the manager, who DOES sound like the pillar of the Gildersleeves radio, ask his grandparents). <br /><br /> And a wise advice: when faced with a woman with a fuzzy appearance who wants to try on bath slippers, always check her ears. <br /><br /> Ten stars for &quot;Hare conditioner&quot;, the best argument so far for animal work laws.']
