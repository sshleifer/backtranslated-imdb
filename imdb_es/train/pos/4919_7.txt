The black cinema of Kazan won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here have extraordinary and extensive details about the film and its symbolism, and they rate it very well. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer to adopt a more attenuated approach to a forgotten film that seems to have been shot practically without a budget and in an almost documentary way. The pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and depends on a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to stop the main carrier (Palance). The film is in a bad mood, shot in black and white, and makes good use of the places. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget symbolism (crime equals illness and disease equals crime) and simply enjoy persecution. It is not always easy to see a movie like this now that we are in this new century, since it is of a particular style that was very ephemeral (from the Second World War to the beginning of the 1950s) and is unlikely to be of interest for the informal ones. movie viewer For those who will see it for the first time, sit down for the big chase at the end. It's something else, and, frankly, I do not know how they filmed some of that. I can say that it probably took as long to film the ending as the first 90 percent of the film did.
