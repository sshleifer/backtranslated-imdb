Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy movie with predictable ending and average performances, it certainly is not. When I saw the movie, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. And he was right <br /> <br /> Stardust is more of a fairy tale than an adventure movie. It has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the end of the film. The story is well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like everything else, it has some morality. Therefore, we know in our hearts that the evil brothers will not take the throne, but the innocent child who manages to overcome all the obstacles and difficulties he encounters during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, the material girl who is superficial and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to give additional credits to Claire Danes. She literally shines in this movie. His eyes have this shine that fits completely into his character. In addition, she and Cox have chemistry, which makes the romance in the film even more remarkable. The rest of the cast are well-known actors and actresses who, of course, make Stardust an interesting and "high-class" movie. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is FANTASTIC, the magical locations and the interesting plot. I was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for more prizes. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
