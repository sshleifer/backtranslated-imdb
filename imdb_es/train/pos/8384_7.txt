I read somewhere (in a fairly panoramic review) that this is something like a real-action wick anime, and I think they are on the right line. The first time I saw this movie was when I was very young and I was dying to see it again, and when I finally did, all the memories flooded me again. I do not think this should be taken too seriously, it's just a bit of the fun of almost an 80's TV movie (it's set in a pretty dark future, although this point is not emphasized too much). What I admired most about this film was that the dialogue did not sound generic, without clich√©s, without predictable lines, in general, just fun! Maybe time has not been kind to this little movie, but I can still appreciate it in me. In no way is it perfect, but it is entertaining and does not try to be anything other than that. Let the shop nerds and comics worry about the technicalities, who cares? See it yourself and make your own decision. Nobody else's opinion matters.
