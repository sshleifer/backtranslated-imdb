As a Red Sox fan, I had to go see the movie. It was great! While there may never be enough live shots of the Red Sox's miraculous season of 2004, there were excellent shots of some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the film is certainly a movie for girls, it has enough baseball images of the amazing comeback of the Red Sox of 2004 to make it one of my 10 best films of all time. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene in which Ben meets with his friends on draft day to determine who will get seats for certain games is very funny! You have to see if you are looking for a healthy movie to watch with your spouse, partner or other important person ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and even more so if you are a Red Sox fan!
