"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman" is as entertaining as the animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> Although it remains faithful to the feeling of comics, the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in animation. series. Bruce Wayne looks a lot like what he had before, but now he seems a little less imposing. The Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by the less aggressive and more youthful Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, invokes Batman's voice better than most live action actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice job than I expected. <br /> <br /> As in the Batman live-action movies, the movie lives or dies depending on the quality of the villains. My favorite of all time, the penguin, is here. Its design is more elegant than it has appeared before, alluding more to the portrait of Burgess Meredith of the 60s than to Danny DeVito's portrait of "Batman Returns". David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the voice of the penguin. The penguin is finally portrayed as a sophisticated cunning, as it most commonly appears in comics. The voice of Hector Elizondo creates a Bane that is much more memorable than the forgettable version in "Batman & Robin". And finally, Batman has to solve a mystery of descent, putting the "Detective" back in "Detective Comics" (that's what "DC" means, after all). The mystery revolution is a delightfully clever turn. <Br /> <br /> The score adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the film. It sounds like a mix between the "Poirot" score and the "Mission: Impossible" score. All in all, it's more entertaining than your average caricature.
