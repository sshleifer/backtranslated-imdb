This first Sirk melodrama, filmed in black and white, is a minor film, but it shows the talent of the German director to highlight tired story lines in something that resembles art. Set in the 1910s, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her husband and family from a small town because of the appeal of the Chicago stage. She never fulfilled her ambitions, and returns to the city she left behind because of an anxious letter from her daughter informing her that she also liked the theater (that is, a high school production). Back in her old city, she once again faces the scant mentality, and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter, her bewildered (and bored) husband (Richard Carlson) and former lover. The plot is nothing new, but Sirk is distinguished by creating significant compositions, with each frame carefully filmed, and is helped immensely by having Stanwyck as its protagonist. It lasts 76 minutes, and that's just as good, because the material does not have legs to go further.
