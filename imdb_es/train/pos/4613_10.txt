This movie has one of the most cheesy plots I've seen. For me, that's what makes it so amazing! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. While there was less slapstick, they still worked wonderfully together "comically". I wish that Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, would have had more participation in the plot. She proved that she could do comedy in the original series, but was mostly wasted in this movie. This film also stars the great Sid Caesar, but unfortunately has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think a better job could have come out of that.
