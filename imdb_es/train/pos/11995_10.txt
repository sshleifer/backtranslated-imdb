"Spin it!" <br /> <br /> The 1990s were opened with Disney's smart favorite, "TaleSpin," the television cartoon series featuring characters from "The Jungle Book." Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly the sea duck like you've never seen it before: from Cape Suzette, to Louie's, to the mountains, through jungles, over water, in volcanoes, in search of adventure, in search of treasures, in search of Fun, all in a cartoon adventure full of action! This was one of my favorites, as well as my family's. This was published in The Disney Afternoon throughout the first half of the 90s until the original cartoons were moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation once in 1996 before getting the cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And good news: today the DVDs are here !!!!! Relive the fun and excitement of "Dun, dun, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
