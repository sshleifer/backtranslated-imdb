Guys and Dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies. It is a very funny movie to watch and nothing more. It embodies what people have forgotten about musicals, musicals were made to entertain, not to preach. Today we have Rent and Chicago, which are excellent musicals and good movies, but they do not provide us with solid entertainment without compromises. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the boy can not sing! It was very annoying to hear him sing and talk when he could not understand it. If it were not for Marlon, I would have given him 10 stars. Guys and Dolls offers old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely have these days. Watch him to have a good time !!
