Lillian Hellman, one of the most famous dramatists in the United States, was a woman with a mission. His leftist views were not well considered at the time in the country. In his memoirs, he recounts his trip to the Soviet Union at the time, as he was intrigued by the so-called successes achieved by that system. "Clock on the Rhine" must have arrived as a result of those years. The left wing in America, since all over the world had a problem with the rise of fascism, not only in Europe, but also in Japan. <br /> <br /> "Watch on the Rhine" was a play produced on Broadway eight months before the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. In it, Mrs. Hellman was announcing the entry of the United States into World War II. The adaptation is credited to Mrs. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, her longtime partner. As directed by Herman Shumlin for the screen, the film was well received when it was released in 1943. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to the Muller family, when the film begins. They are crossing the border into the United States from Mexico. They must continue to Mrs. Muller's house in Washington, DC, where her mother, Fanny Farrelly, is a minor hostess. The Mullers, we realize that they are fleeing Europe due to the persecution that is taking place against the opponents of the advance of the totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact, we think, in some way, that the Mullers could have been better justified if they were Jews, fleeing from a secure extermination. <br /> <br /> We discovered that Mr. Muller has had a terrible time in his native land, as well as in other places due to his frankness in the denunciation of Fascim. Little does he know that he is arriving at his mother-in-law's house which houses one of the worst exponents of that philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film offers an excellent performance in all areas. It is a piece of curiosity due to the supporting role of Bette Davis. Paul Lukas, repeating his role on Broadway, is quite convincing as Kurt Muller, the standing man who wants to make a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas does a great job playing Kurt Muller, repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on Broadway. <br /> <br /> The other best performance is that of Lucile Watson, who plays Fanny Farrelly, the matriarch of this family. . Geraldine Fitzgerald is seen as Marthe Brancovis, a guest of the Farrelly, married to the despicable Teck of Brancovis, a Nazi sympathizer, played by George Coulouris. Beulah Bondi, Donald Woods and the rest of the supporting cast provide good performances guided by Mr. Shumlin. <br /> <br /> The film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian government, no matter where.
