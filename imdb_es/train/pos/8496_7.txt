Wow, it's been years since I last saw this movie. Seeing it in 2008 is certainly different from seeing it in 1986. Initially I did not think I would make it through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so nasty, arrogant and disrespectful that I found it hard to see him. He embodied every negative stereotype of Americans. If that was not bad enough, once it was shown to the best workers in the small American city, the image only got worse. In the opposite spectrum, the Japanese presented themselves as emotionless and robotic workaholics. The movie was not even that funny, I just stayed there for the nostalgic value of it. And I'm glad I continued the clock. <br /> <br /> As in boxing, the judges get carried away by the way you finish the round. This movie went from approximately three to seven. I qualified it by the end. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious ending and this was just that. It was great that the city could keep its jobs and the factory, but the most special thing was the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note.
