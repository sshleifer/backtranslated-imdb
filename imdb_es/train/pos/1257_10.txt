I have read several reviews of this film and I have to say "What's wrong with you?" This was an excellent movie! I thought that this movie was excellent from beginning to end and the story was very well told. I am convinced that people who did not like this movie did not pay much attention to it. There are a series of very important scenes that, if you are not paying attention, you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. I urge everyone who does not like this movie to see it again and see it alone so they can really pay attention. The story made a lot of sense to me and as I said, it was very well told. Each scene in the movie has a point and everything fits at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as Tanny Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a nice touch and she looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, really did not expect anything good from him, but he achieved a great performance. Ed Harris was the true jewel in the movie. He plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is. Look at his eyes in his scenes, simply excellent! Also, there's a very young Scarlett Johansson (like Kate) in one of her first roles ... it's not a bad place to start. Excellent cast in this movie! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers. This is a great movie and it should be seen. Do not listen to all the opinions of other people, go see the movie and draw your own conclusions. I hope you see the movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
