This is an excellent movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle, much of it is familiar, winter, canoeing, hunting, hunting and so on. It's easy to take the familiar for granted, but after seeing this movie several times, it grew on me. <br /> <br /> Gray Owl's story is well known to many Canadians who attribute themselves to director Attenborough and screenwriter Nicholson. for expanding the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan plays a complex man well, a very good performance. Annie Galipeau is charming in her first great role. The rest of the cast is solid.
