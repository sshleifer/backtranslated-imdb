This film was nominated for best film but was lost in Casablanca, but Paul Lukas defeated Humphrey Bogart as best actor. I do not understand why Lucile Watson was nominated for best supporting actor, I just do not think she did a good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and enter the United States in the first scene of the film. They go by train to the house of Davis' relatives. Davis and Lukas were on the subway to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and need to rest. But when they get home, his is a Nazi who lives there and he can not do much about it either. It turns out that the Nazis only care about the money and are willing to make a deal with Lukas. There is more to the plot, but you can discover it for yourself.
