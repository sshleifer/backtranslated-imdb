The first time I saw this movie was 3 years ago, and it was presented by the then boss of Disney Eisner and the real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago, he returned to television, and this time I recorded it. Since then, I must have seen him at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, inspiring movie that feels good, written intelligently and credibly performed by everyone involved. Resist going for every sentimental trick in the book, as well as for all the other clich√©s. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to see a movie where children are not idiots and have a whole host of behavioral problems. , and athletes are not represented as muscle heads driven by testosterone. <br /> <br /> These are normal people who dream like you and me. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood has disappeared. another extreme to what they call "harsh realism," which makes films where everyone curses and has problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a man who has a dream, and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream. The people in Big Lake, TX, seem so nice that I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not try to exaggerate with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as always, never disappoints. I've seen it since the late 70's and it's very underestimated. <br /> <br /> But this movie has excellent performances by ALL, and congratulations to the writers. <br /> <br /> A Jewel The movie is near the end when Jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game, and his wife calls him from the stands. He hurries and approaches his family. The look on the faces of the other three pitchers who are sitting on the bench in the dugout is priceless. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a change of pace, then pick up this movie.
