['Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. You know the part where Shadow falls down the ditch ... little thing, I * cried *, considering he was only six years old, I cried! I have a hard time making me cry! The dogs and the cat are excellently trained. A good family movie, * not * for people who are not fluffy or who hate animals that are completely hardened, but could be for people like me. <br /><br /> A good movie in general, 10/10!']
