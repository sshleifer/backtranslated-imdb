As winter approaches, our state broadcaster, ABC, has decided for some reason to have a partial Jane Austen Festival on Sunday nights. This began with a twelve-year version of "Emma" last Sunday; More recent versions of three other novels, "Persuasion", "Abbey of Northanger" and "Mansfield Park" are coming. <br /> <br /> The curious thing about this production of A & E Television Networks, with scripts of all time. The reliable Andrew Davies is that he appeared almost simultaneously with two versions of much cheaper films, one starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and "Clueless", a "modernized" version, starring Alicia Silverstone, who transported the plot to Beverly Hills. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale at the helm, this production sank without a trace. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, much is lost when novels are reduced to fit the length of the film. The adaptations that one tends to enjoy and remember are those that have enough space to develop the story and the characters. An outstanding example is "Brideshead Revisited", which had 13 episodes of 50 minutes in 1982. You just have to compare the very ordinary version of "Pride and Prejudice" in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 television miniseries. Not that a novel has to be filmed page by page, and some novels (often not very good ones) are wonderfully adapted to the film ("Atonement" is a recent example), but Jane Austen-type novels need some time and space to exercise them. its complete charm. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation, this production is fine. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right combination of self-confidence and vulnerability and Mark Strong is a direct Mr. Knightly (reminded me that Jane tended to recycle characters? Knightly is a more articulate version of Mr. Darcy's P & P). Samantha Morton was a pretty loose Harriet, but Prunella Scales got Miss Bates to perfection. Sybil Fawlty in speed. Bernard Hepton as Emma's weak father was also excellent. We saw the damp countryside, the mud and poverty, as well as the elegant interiors, in case anyone thought that this was a particularly idyllic time for everyone. <br /> <br /> Although this was a condensed adaptation, it was strangely slow in places ?? Some of the conversations were quite forced, even allowing the formalities of the times. I would have to look at the film again to be sure, but it could be due to insufficient use of the reaction shots. <br /> <br /> If you like things from the filmed period, this is a perfectly nice example. and it compares well with Paltrow's version. Anyway, there is more to come!
