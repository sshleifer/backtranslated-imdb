I think I usually approach the comedies of film festivals with the low expectation that they will always be "extravagant", and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the simplicity of the characters in a complicated context. What was exceptional about Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding the humor of laughing out loud scene after scene. There was a sophistication, perhaps also due in part to the sharp work of the PD, which I have rarely seen in an independent film, and even more rarely in a comedy. Of special interest here: Paget Brewster's turn as Amy the math teacher. After watching this performance, I can not understand why Brewster has not been "discovered" by a wider audience. She brings the necessary mixture of anger and sympathy to the role that really helps this image reach its potential. This is an excellent job that deserves a bigger audience. I hope more of the director and this cast!
