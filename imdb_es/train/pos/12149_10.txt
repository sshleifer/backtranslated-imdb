I agree with another user here and I have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies in history. I saw this as a child and I loved it! The scenes of the scaffolding are bright and you can really empathize with this guy because he is considered an outcast. Good humor and fantastic kung fu this movie is cool! If you like Kung Fu you would love this!
