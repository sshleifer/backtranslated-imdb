The spirit is a unique and original look to western life from the point of view of a wild horse and Native Americans. The film focuses on the friendships and dangers that a wild horse, the Spirit, encounters during its life. <br /> <br /> Very well done in the presentation, using the technology available today to offer impressive images that are impressive in their depth. and realism. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular music of Disney's 1994 success, The Lion King. <br /> <br /> The story is not very deep, but the fact that it is not as deep as some movies does not in my opinion detract from the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that I enjoyed a lot, and that is suitable for the whole family. Do not miss out (10/10)
