"Protocol" is an image of success and failure starring Goldie Hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of an Arab visitor from an assassination attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job for the government of the United States. Will the corridors of power in our nation's capital be the same? Hawn is excellent as usual, although "Protocol" is not as fun as his best movie "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
