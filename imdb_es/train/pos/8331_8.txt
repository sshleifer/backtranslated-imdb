This movie is a very relaxed romantic comedy, which is completely enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as the great niece of Albert Einstein, although she believes in her own abilities. Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when he enters his shop with his fianc√© after his car gets stuck. I loved Walter Matthau as the only and only Albert Einstein. This movie has a very relaxing feeling, but still maintains a certain seriousness (if that is really possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> Personally, I found this film extremely entertaining, especially the old scientists - I thought they were fabulous and fun! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a great sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
