This made for crime what "Not Another Teen Movie" did for the school. I laughed all the time while 2 inept bands fought each other and each other. A subtle little comedy with jokes and jokes that kept me rolling all the way. I guess the biggest joke in the whole movie was that time never seemed to move forward, leaving the characters trapped in the 30s.
