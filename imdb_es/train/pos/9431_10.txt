And this is a very disturbing movie. I may be wrong, but this is the last film in which I considered Burt Reynolds as a real actor, who transformed the paper and delivered a message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are simple and unconscious; Entrepreneurs eager to enjoy the country. Little did they know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and scenarios are realistic and natural. This was before the days of Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing part of this movie is the fact that places like this still exist. In America, the country people still detest the people of the city; It's almost a century and a half since the Civil War. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in the rural sections of South Georgia, which still exist. Just do not go to Mobile, Alabama; That area has not yet been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
