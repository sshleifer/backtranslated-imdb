['My favorite character in the movies, but in almost all of them the character of Zorro has a bit of cloth as a mask and if the villain does not know who is under that cloth, then they are stupid. <br /><br /> But in Reed Hadley &quot;Zorro`s Fighting Legion&quot; (series 1939), the mask fills his face, which makes it a real mystery about who is really Zorro. <br /><br /> But anyway, Zorro is one of the best characters in the movies and, to bring it up to date, I think Anthony Hopkins in &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998) is a delight. <br /><br /> My interest in movies is very broad, but I really like the series of the 30s and 40s ... <br /><br /> Bond2a']
