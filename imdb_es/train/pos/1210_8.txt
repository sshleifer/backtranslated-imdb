And my children love it now! Of course, I can see it now and realize that the animation was not so good, and that the plot is trivial. Hey, if all the villains showed up saying "I ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT" I think you could laugh at them, but for little kids it's a moral story with catchy music. <br /> <br /> So catchy music, of course. , who still had the words memorized after not having seen this movie in twenty years. I would definitely recommend this for younger children.
