This game is above all else until now. I had the honor of playing mine on PS2, so the graphics were really good. The voice acting was above the norm. The level of difficulty is fair. Wesker has to be the best characters in the RE series in my opinion. The story surprised me and took many different turns I did not expect. The only rating that this game deserves is great.
