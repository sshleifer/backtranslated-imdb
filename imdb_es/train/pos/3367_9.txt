['This film has a great performance, a great photography and a very strong plot that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you integrate, whether you accept to play a role or you are liberated ... There are already excellent comments on these aspects . I want to comment on the formal adjustment of the film. Basically, they are two people in a roof. There is unity of place and time, with 2 protagonists, and the radio acts as the choir. Many directors have turned Greek tragedies into films, many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, has had success as admirable as Ettore Scola in addressing the purity and strength of the great Greek tragedies. In the line of history and formal adjustment A masterpiece.']
