This movie was made in 1948, but even today it sounds true. Very very funny. Start with a family that wants to buy a small place in the country and "build" from there. Anyone who has built a house will find this film very attractive. Great cast Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delighted with this movie. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the great style of the 40s ... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons with today's costs are quite surprising. I can not imagine someone who is not enjoying this movie completely. I am surprised by the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. A true classic.
