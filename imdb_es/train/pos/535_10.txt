['A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would do justice to the genius and beauty of this movie? The visual imagination of Powell and Pressburger has no limits, each painting is full of incredibly bold compositions. The changes between the striking colors of the &quot;real world&quot; and the black and white of the sky are ingenious, and visually show us how much more vibrant is life. The final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and the jury descend the stairway to heaven to celebrate the court over the operation of Peter (David Niven). <br /><br /> All the performances are successful (Roger Livesey is a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, there has never been a more romantic movie than this one (if I have not seen it). A matter of life and death has to do with the power of love and how important life is. And Jack Cardiff&#39;s cinematography is reason enough to see the movie alone, the way it illuminates Kim Hunter&#39;s face makes her even more beautiful, what genius, she can make simple things like a game of table tennis look exciting. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way in which the sound is silenced in the vital points was a decision very advanced to its time <br /><br /> This is a true classic that can restore the faith of anyone in the cinema, little appreciated in its initial release and by today&#39;s audience, but one of my favorites of all time, that&#39;s why I give this movie a 10/10, in a word: beautiful.']
