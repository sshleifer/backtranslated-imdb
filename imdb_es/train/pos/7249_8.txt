It is difficult for me to assign the "fair" number of stars to this film, but I decided on 8 due to its high production values ​​and what was, in 1968, an innovative approach to the war movie. Remember also that I have not seen it since 1969. But it made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> The Long Day's Dying must be one of the most vivid anti-war movies ever made. This is achieved simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern Europe in 1944-45. No film before it showed the war at the level of infantry squads with so many brutal details, and all in a coldly dispassionate way that allows the actions to speak for themselves. There is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no subtlety either. Partly because of their situation, when trying to stay alive, the characters are seen as flat and familiar clichés. As "entertainment," the film does not make it, although it was clearly not meant to "entertain." It was thought to hit him in the head with the misery and horror of World War II and modern war in general. This was twenty years before Peloton and thirty before Saving Private Ryan, which are much more "visible" movies. Here, the flat and generally unpleasant characters, the lack of a real plot and the realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first vomit on screen in theatrical history) make the film difficult to interpret, although it is only 95 minutes <br /> <br /> Then, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when you finish, an extra star for having your heart in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like "The Victors" underrated by Carl Foreman, an equally scary but more interesting and stimulating movie, The Long Day's Dying does not seem to be on DVD. Why not? Both films have been cabled several times.
