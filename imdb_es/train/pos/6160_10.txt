SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I had just seen the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I wish they had left the original version on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The Portabello Road could have been reduced to the original length. It was too long and dragged the film along. Although the dance is great, it would have been much better to leave it on the DVD as a deleted scene. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great movie. My 5 year old son liked it. And it's wonderful that the films that I enjoyed as a girl happen to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins were added to my collection. <br /> <br /> As he had remembered! <br /> <br /> *** of **** <br /> <br />
