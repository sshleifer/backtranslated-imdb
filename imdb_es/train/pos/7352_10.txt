This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and now I am hooked. Well, it requires adopting a different mentality than watching movies from the USA. UU., But once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is, you will not be disappointed. The songs are superb, melodic and very catchy. The actors are visually appealing, especially Karisma Kapoor, who is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful actresses in the world of cinema. The locations, the color are fascinating. If you want something different and you want to be animated, encouraged and stimulated, I recommend you watch this movie.
