This movie seems to have bad reviews for some reason. Probably only for the mass population. Anyway, this is actually a very interesting movie. The movie is a low budget science fiction movie that really works, due to an interesting story and well done scenes. <br /> <br /> Although this movie may not be for everyone. If there is a science fiction fan that reads this, I really recommend this movie if you like good science fiction. The movie has crazy ideas. The scenario includes nations that go to war with GIGANTIC machines in which all countries invest all their money! The world has been divided into territories. Anyone can challenge someone else to a war, or rather, a "robot duel". The method of war is cleaner than nuclear war, since now everyone is wearing those masks. Definitely a movie that makes you think. Intelligent, well written and good effects for the miserable budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to like movies that have small budgets and really work.
