A visit from Hitler in Rome is the backdrop to this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stay at home while her entire family attends the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay at home since the family can not afford a maid. Although she would have loved to go, since together with the whole housing complex where she lives, she is an ardent admirer of Il Duce. <br /> <br /> However, there is an exception. On the other side of the patio, Marcello Mastroianni sits in his chair contemplating suicide. The reason? He is gay and that's why he recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The movie really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is desperate and needs a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own deceptive husband, misinterprets Mastroianni and in a scene masterfully filmed, directed and acted on the roof of the building complex, she offers her body only to be rejected. The initial wedge is replaced shortly after by his hunger for this man, this antifascist, this homosexual, this other world that is so willing to give him everything she wants. <br /> <br /> This is a beautifully designed film with two of the most talented actors in history. Loren proves here that she is a caliber actress when she is well directed. This is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and, most importantly, the human condition. Despite its sad end, there is a glimmer of hope in the outcome, things will change, someone has understood.
