I was able to watch the movie "On Thin Ice" on television in India ... I must say that the film was very well made and it really made me shiver. The basic story makes me reflect on what makes certain addicts decide to move on to where others are still addicted ... <br /> <br /> however, I felt that Diane Keaton was at her best ... the scene in the one that has cravings, and begins to rummage around in her house looking for cocaine ... it was the best ... the two guys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed how good her actress is ... The script is well done , as it is the cinematography and the direction ... and the casting <br /> <br /> It is necessary to see the film ... for all.
