When I went to see this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to see a boring teenage movie, BUT in fact the plot is interesting and well executed, the acting was convincing, especially from Melville who really shows his talent in this movie. and the fight scenes were, for a low budget movie, very well done. <br /> <br /> I think this movie deserves a wider audience than it has received. It is a film, which can be seen by the whole family, maybe it is not the smallest of the children, since it contains some rather difficult scenes. A film about love and the problems that can arise when it goes against family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very similar to "Bend it like Beckham", but in reality I think this movie accomplishes it better.
