This was an absolutely fascinating series and I regretted that I could only catch some shows when it aired late at night in the UK. The style was very different from others of its kind and everything had a disconcerting air of elegant fear. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that you can see) to realize how truly innovative this series was and how it caught the imagination. Now I understand that by reading the comments CANCELED, that is so incredible. What a bunch of "headless and overpaid turkeys" must have (or maybe still are) running to do that.
