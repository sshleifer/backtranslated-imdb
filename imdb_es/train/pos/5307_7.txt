"Pecker" is a young unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star of the public, the media and the local art scene with his photographs showing the dirty reality of everyday life, such as dirty underwear or excrement humans. It is a typical theme of independent comedies based on John Waters Baltimore to show the strange aspects of the American lifestyle between the fashion of political correctness and conservative violent reactions to explore the background of the middle class society of his hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong of "Terminator 2" plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and Water Mink Stole actress. Although the rhythm of the plot becomes a big flaw at times and can not compete with the fast and furious attacks of the brilliant "Serial Mom" ​​by Water, it still has some good laughs and some unforgettable scenes as a former addicted to the girls who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a plate of vegetables ... "Pecker" is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, the exaggerations of the media, the sexual anguish of the middle class and the strange shapes of becoming a pop star without realizing it.
