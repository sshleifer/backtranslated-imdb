['This is almost a perfect movie. The ideas would be repeated by Mamet, but never told so succinctly. This is really about the failure of trust, of the human condition. The film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, nobody is innocent. Is there anyone alive today who has not seen this game in our own society, every day? The movie is very structured like a Hitchcock thriller. Except, there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely contaminated, ruined and everyone is participating in the scam. Could it be something more true? <br /><br /> Do not miss the soundtrack. It is wonderful.']
