Lin takes his horse and goes after Dutch and his men and the rifle with his friend High Spade (Millard Mitchell). The rifle is put in different hands on the road. Will it return to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and created this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950). Stewart is the right man to play the lead role. He was always the right man to do anything. The excellent Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and she is great as always. Dan Duryea is great in the Waco part of Johnnie Dean. Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend, Steve Miller. Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the film. played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell. The young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan. There are many classic moments in this movie. At one point, the group is surrounded by Indians, since this is a western. It is great to see this survival game where the fastest box and the most skillful shooter is the winner. All true Western fans will love this movie.
