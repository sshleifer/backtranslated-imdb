I really like this movie. Bozz is an ultra-cool soldier, who should not be intimidated and who does not want to go to war. His character is similar to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. This film, however, is not set in a war zone, but rather in preparation for combat before the war. This wonderful movie has to do with the unhealthy understanding that the Vietnam War was a mistake and those men who were destined to be sacrificed for a lost cause. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who showed as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier, since he made disdain and irreverence for the establishment that was trying to kill him. Bozz is totally great and does not feel perplexed, he is trying and adjusting his military superiors, getting his goat at every opportunity. He is a figure of Jesus Christ with a degree in psychology, who "saves" his fellow soldiers and shows those who really need it, the departure of this man's army. <br /> <br /> The acting and the action are clear and credible. As "Sleeper", Tigerland falls with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the three best films of Vietnam in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, one of the best options.
