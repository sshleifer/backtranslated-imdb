This film has been made by one of the most absurd comedians in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was surprised for a second to do a romantic comedy, but knowing that he was a great movie buff, he was seen in all the local festivals and in the local cinematic, I had a positive feeling about this movie. <br /> <br /> Hell, he was right. From the beginning, the stage (written by Pelletier himself) is a bit twisted and difficult to follow, but, in the manner of Pelletier, is a unique 90-minute jack-in-the-box in its class. <br /> <br /> Allusion vaguely inspired and mostly transformed into Dangerous Liaisons (by Laclos) "Les Aimants" consists of a twisted game of writing notes in the refrigerator. Throughout the film you will have the opportunity to discover who is who and who is writing whom in that damn fridge ... that appears in an interesting love story. <br /> <br /> Great story, excellent photography, Great quotes from other movies. Should we ask for more for a first movie?
