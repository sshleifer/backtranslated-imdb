An interesting way to see how humans behave so often that we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we sometimes destroy the basis of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the question of how we tend to ignore those among us who are not so frank and, in doing so, we may miss a great opportunity. The injection of comedy also makes watching the film a pleasant experience ... A must for anyone interested in a reflective but comical look at life. I look forward to your next product. I hope you continue to provide quality entertainment. Excellent work ...... Joanne
