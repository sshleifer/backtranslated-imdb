A Bugs Life is a great movie that is not only for children, but also for adults. The story revolves around a colony of ants and their fight against the evil Grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food (A Mirror of the Magnifiscent seven). There are some wonderful animations on the computer and the voices are also great. You will love it!! 8 out of 10
