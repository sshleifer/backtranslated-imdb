Very good western. This was the first time that the writer Richard Wilson directed a film, and this was the first time that Samuel Goldwyn Junior was a producer. It is a pleasure to see an Angie Dickinson very young and pretty as a girl in the living room. Robert Mitchum arrives in this city dominated by the outlaws and is hired as a tamer of the city, but people worry that he will go too far, and also because of the damage it will cause to the city's businesses. There are some similarities in the story with "Warlock" that was made in 1959. This film maintains a very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you to the limit.
