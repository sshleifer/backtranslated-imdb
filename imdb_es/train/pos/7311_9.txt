Halloween is a movie that I have to go out and look at every time it IS THAT day of the year. I even see her sometimes when it's not festive! This movie is VERY great. Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop loving. This movie may be old, but the story line still puts me there every time, and the acting was absolutely fantastic. Although I have not seen the new version, I feel it was COMPLETELY unnecessary. I think Rob Zombie should NEVER have remade a classic like that. What kills me, however, is knowing that there are some people who have seen the remake without even having heard the original. I'm getting mad just thinking about it !!! This movie was great, and will always be remembered in history as a classic.
