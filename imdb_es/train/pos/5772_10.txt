I used to watch this show as a kid, and I loved it! I saw him when he appeared on Toonami YEARS ... Sheesh, it seems very old! I should have been 13 or 14 years old when it came on ... But anyway, I had a great plot, and I'm one of those girls who saw (and LOVED) Sailormoon, and I enjoyed it a lot. The animation was not the best ... Pretty funny in some places, actually, and the voice acting was EXTREMELY boring at first, but everything was a good watch, and I found myself absorbed day after day. <br /> <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic, and one of my favorites of all time. Go ryo !!!!
