The performance of Om Puri, Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and all the chemistry go well, along with the minimalist approach of the narration and direction of Govind Nihlani. The dialogues of Vijay Tendulkar are also great. <br /> <br /> I have not seen another movie like this one. It is a whole, each piece fits very well in the plot. You can not be impressed by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri appears as the bossy and 'baap' husband of Om Puri. Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft villain. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty in the place of Sadhashiv is absolutely impressive. Smita Patil does not play a leading role, but her part is not distracted from the main plot either. <br /> <br /> And to add to all this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who has come to an agreement with the system and its operation. Saying the right things in the right places and knowing how to stay away from problems. He is also the "guru" of Om Puri and helps him when he gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> The film not only focuses on the difficulties faced by a police officer who tries to fulfill his duty, but also the other. Side of brutalities in police custody. Om Puri captures the despair and the burning desire to free himself in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> A gift for all the avid fans of Indian cinema.
