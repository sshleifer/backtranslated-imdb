The Man from Snowy River II does not reinvent the wheel, but it is a beautiful film that attracts the crowd and plays some great notes. <br /> <br /> For those fans who want the elements that made Man From Snowy River's original film a Blow, (stunning scenery, sweeping score, sweet romanticism and cracking action) that this film really offers . This story goes back a few years since the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) has been absent accumulating his fortune in a litter of horses. He returns to continue where he left him with his corpulent and sweet girlfriend Jessica (played by the Australian lady Sigrid Thornton) who is still trying to escape from her corseted education at her pen's cattle station (Harrison is now played by American Brian) Dennehy). The role of Jim and the character that shakes the plot is the well-educated upper class snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) who has his eyes on Jessica. Add to the mix some social tension surrounding the properties and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first film and that's the plot. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the acting. Tom Burlinson fits perfectly with Jim's broad-brimmed hat and laconic humor. Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine and they both manage a bit of real chemistry on the screen. Filling the solid shoes of Kirk Douglas was never going to be easy and Brian Dennehy stomps and screams, but he never feels very authentic in this part. <br /> <br /> The music is overwhelming and exuberant and the cinematography could be a roll of a Victoria tourist reel. However, there are times when I feel very self-indulgent, as if the director wanted just one more helicopter shot of the runners to show how beautiful the landscape is without any personal human drama. A little more sand would have sufficed here, we are Aussie's, we can take it! There are some very amazing moments with the stallion that challenges the belief. However, the funny thing about this movie is that, among some obvious clich√©s, there are some really inventive and moving scenes. Jim placing the chair on the stallion (VERY Horse Whisperish before his time) Jim and Jessica prepare their home, the fabulous scene in which Jim shows Alistair riding with his reliable whip. I can see why this character is such an icon. <br /> <br /> Altogether, a very nice sequel. We hope that everyone involved wants to make another one. The Man Of The Snowy River III: The CRAIGS. I'm sure we would all love to see how Jim and Jessica are at their farm. <br /> <br /> The Aussie DVD has a couple of additional scenes. It's worth it if you're already a fan.
