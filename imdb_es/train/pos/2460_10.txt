Hamlet is by far my favorite of all Shakespeare's plays. Branaugh is a great actor. Your representation of this was simply incredible. His soliloquies were impressive. While it was rare for a movie to maintain my interest, however, I was absorbed in this particular piece. I recommend it to everyone, both Shakespeare fans and those who do not. This has everything the modern world looks for in its films: murder, betrayal and deception. Not to hit Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs plays all the work. This leaves no stone unturned. When the film is over, you will feel as if you were reading the play yourself. Um how do you say "two thumbs up".
