This is a wonderfully written and well-acted psychological drama. It's not really a horror movie, so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and the subtle attention to details in the plot and the effort made to be internally coherent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil's psychobabble or the New Age revisionism. Instead of advancing in an agenda, the filmmakers simply told the story, told it well and let the viewer think about it. The scattered dream landscapes are reminiscent of Wyeth's paintings and are incredibly effective. <br /> <br /> A great example of how to make a good movie on a small budget, without big studios, star actors, renowned directors (this was much better than many of Hitchcock's films), special effects or " ingenious "plot twist.
