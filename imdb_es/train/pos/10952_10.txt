Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I read the other 'comment' on this program, as well as the things on the message board and people just do not understand it. Nothing that appears on TV is an accident. Too much money, time and work are put into the production of a television and television program to make mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted me to be stupid. This show is youthful because Sarah wanted it to be youthful. I thought the jokes were great and that the theme and the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre. It's a lot like Pee-Wee's Playhouse to sniff out the mismatched, lazy, twenty-year-old glue, Future Pornstars of America from the Valley. The cast is impressive. The scenarios and the action are of good rhythm. I hope this program is successful because Comedy Central did not allow David Spade to maintain his program. Who plays Sarah's sister? She is not in the distribution list on the program's homepage. I would love to see her standing. Does anyone know about the dates of their upcoming shows or DVDs that may be floating around?
