The big bad swimming has a low budget, indie feels about it. So many times I start to see independent films that have had very good reviews only to discover that they are a pretentious mockery, voted by people who are so blinded by the idea of ​​the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that the film is a way of Entertainment first and foremost. <br /> <br /> I do not know if The big bad swim has any higher message or meaning or metaphor, if it does, then I missed it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, BBS felt good, it was easy, warm and human, there were no important dramas or meaningful ideas, I simply connected with the characters immediately. And when, as with all good movies, the end came, I felt sad for the loss of that connection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something big, or a quick or insightful look elsewhere, look for a movie that will try it. to deliver more than he can. BBS offers a solid, pleasant and real experience, and I felt rewarded and satisfied for having seen it.
