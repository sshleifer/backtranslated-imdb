I've seen this movie more than several times, on television. I ALWAYS see it again ... NEVER turn the channel. This movie is full of chilling surprises, and it is absolutely a suspense on the edge of your seat, without being stifling or stupid. The talent of Helen Hunt is magnificently shown in this movie! I recommend this movie to anyone !!!
