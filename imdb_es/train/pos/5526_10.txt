I love movies, so what I'm going to confess, I'm deeply ashamed. I had given a thumbs down to "Che, Parts 1 and 2" without having seen the movie. Terrible I know. But I felt in a trap perpetrated by ... who? I really do not know, but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like a wild fire and, no matter how smart I think it is, I fell into it. But, fortunately, I met an Argentine film director, Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told him I was not going to see him because I knew the movie was a failure, he looked at me like he was ready to punch me in the face and Donovan is a pacifist. He took me aside and told me how much he liked the movie and why. I went to see both parts immediately and "Che, part 1 and 2" is the best movie I've seen in 2008. It's, in such a purity, that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. Respect for your audience is something we are not used to. I do not know if we ever were. Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is simply extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can really perceive it. The humanity of man is overwhelming. So, thank you, Martin Donovan, once again, for educating me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this historic film. Do not make the mistake you were about to commit. Go see it, now, on the big screen.
