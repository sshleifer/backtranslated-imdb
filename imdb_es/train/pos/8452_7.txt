Overloaded mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - Check! Weapons that almost do not need to be targeted and still annihilate everything - Check! Angelic-based robes - Check! <br /> <br /> OK - it's a Gundam series. This, Gundam Wing, has a good character development, real world complexity, interesting ideas and a little visual appeal. <br /> <br /> With characters, the initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) becomes stronger and more independent (although she is still absolutely fascinated with Heero Yuy, the main character in the series) . The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold and hard butcher, becomes more and more human, while still being the character. And seeing the lost Peacecraft Millardo (whose name is Zechs Marquise) float between OZ, freelance and the White Fang command shows how some people can really get lost in their own creations. <br /> <br /> The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good, reflecting how the real world works. However, in 49 episodes of half an hour, it becomes a small responsibility to the extent that this complexity is not used to its full potential. <br /> <br /> The ideas at the core of the series: the need for The struggle, the desire for peace, etc. they are the ones that resonate even today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, with the "War on Terrorism" and all. But his exploration of these ideas, the monologues, especially those of Treize Kushrenada, is an incredible dramatic piece, forming some of the best writings of the series. <br /> <br /> But sometimes good writing is also extremely poor. , which dramatically causes him to lose some of his advantage. <br /> <br /> In terms of goodies, which is what this has in cubes, everything from the mobile suits to the battleship Libra (No, not tampons! Idiot!) is designed for wells and explodes in large balls of orange (which is bad, because a better animation would have had better explosions). But who cares?! Things explode, and that is all that matters. <br /> <br /> In summary, the great complexity of the series means that if you miss some episodes, you've lost a lot. Bad writing can leave you shaking, and sometimes the animation makes you go "WTF?!?!" But this is offset by its classic animation style, its scale, sparks of incredible dialogues and its more mature exploration that is expected from such Japanese animations.
