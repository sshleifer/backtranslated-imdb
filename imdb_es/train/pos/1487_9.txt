['&quot;Casomai&quot; is a master story that describes the story of a young couple who enters the murky waters of marriage. The story is very credible in telling the strange seesaw between oblivion and the continuous interference of others, which is quite typical in Italy (although one may wonder if these events are different in other places). Pavignano and D&#39;Alatri were very good at writing, and that is one of the strong points of the film. The performance of Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and exciting. And the figure of the sympathetic priest is fun and complete. In short, a really worthy movie, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.']
