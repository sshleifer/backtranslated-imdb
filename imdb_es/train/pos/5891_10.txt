THE ITALIAN is a surprisingly made film for its time. Incredibly filmed, with lighting effects that are truly sublime, this is an early gem that clearly reveals that REGINALD BARKER is a pioneer director of the same reputation as D.W. GRIFFITH AND MAURICE TOURNEUR. It is difficult to know how much control Thomas Ince exerted over production, but this film still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in New York is very moving. The issues of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today. The use of close-ups is excellent and the performance of GEORGE BEBAN's power house is electrifying. What we need now is a really good impression transferred to DVD so that we can truly appreciate this masterpiece of cinema.
