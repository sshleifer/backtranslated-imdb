['When I write this, I see that with more than 15,000 votes, it has a rating of 5.8. Something is wrong with that image. Personally I give it a 10. I can see a 7 in the lowest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people who see this movie for what it really is. It&#39;s a movie based on a comic book hero. This movie won more than it is part of the awards. He won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations ... right there tells me it&#39;s better than a 5.8. Some great performances by some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion they will be, if not, already a classic for the coming years. If you are looking for pure entertainment, be sure to visit Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie that you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice.']
