<br /> <br /> I once saw No Man's Land (1987) - link IMDB http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and I found it right. The movie is about a guy who steals only Porsches. Gone in Sixty Seconds arrives 13 years later and does not add anything to it. In fact, it has many scenes that are worthless. And the end is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used ...
