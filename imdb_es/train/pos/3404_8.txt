The audiences in 1936 must have been stunned by what they were seeing: a beautiful and complete Technicolor film. I can not say for sure, but this could have been the first (3-strip). In any case, it still looks beautiful more than 70 years later on DVD. In fact, how good it looks is amazing. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Director Richard Boleslowski, Director of Photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and DVD - MGM Home Entertainment. All of them combined to give us one of the most attractive films of the classical era. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was fair: excellent in the first half, stuck in the second. He gave a nice message at the end, even though many people might not have been happy with him. I can not say more without ruining things. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I do not think so, and she certainly never played such a soft character ("Domini Enfilden"). The throbbing Charles Boyer was the male star and the object of Domini's affection, but some of the supporting characters were the most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as "Batouch"; John Carradine as "The Sand Diviner"; The most memorable, at least for me, was the dancer "Irena", played by Tilly Losch. Wow, there is a face and a dance that you will not forget! I've never seen anything like it in the thousands of movies I've seen. The mere fact of seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD. As for his IMDb curriculum, he only had four films, but they were all well-known movies. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing "Sherlock Holmes," is also here. as is C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his time. Schildkraut, by the way, will be recognized by classic moviegoers as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the hit "The Shop Around The Corner," with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> The beautiful direction, the photography and the color, and the dance of Tilly, are the things that I will remember best of this movie, which is a lot of good things and not so good, all in one. If the last half hour had been better, although I admire the end, I would have rated it even higher. He is definitely one of the movie collectors who want to add to his collection.
