This film brings many memories of the classic cinema of yesteryear, where the actors did not have to take off their clothes to make the spectators see their film. <br /> <br /> First, I think the main point in favor of this movie is The amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita is definitely the making of the movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen many comments about the film being sickly, sweet and too muddy. In response to this, I think that up to a point this is a correct analysis; however, considering that it is a Barjatya movie, I think that compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been significantly attenuated. HSSH was almost unbearable to see in some places. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, when the sentimental moments arrive, you find yourself smiling, wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them. . <br /> <br /> Another important positive point is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both have performed very well, especially Shahid, who looks great in the film. Amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as an important future star. <br /> <br /> Although I really enjoyed the movie as a whole, I think it was too long. Part of the medium could have been cut back and might have had an even greater impact. I also think that music, although it fits into the movie when you see situations is a little outdated and the movie could have benefited if there was a more up-to-date soundtrack available. Although the image of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful. <br /> <br /> In general, I definitely recommend this movie, it is romantic, it looks awesome and it has a dramatic climax (I will not go into details, in case you have not seen it. <br /> <br /> PS If you are prone to cry, take a handkerchief! (I needed several)
