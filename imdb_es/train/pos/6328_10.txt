It is so rewarding to see a great work of art converted into another without distortion or artifice. I had no idea how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a movie that was worth seeing. If he liked Bulgakov's book, understandably, he would be scared to see a misinterpretation made more for an art film project than to bring the deeper meaning of the story to the screen. There are a couple of examples of this with Maestro and Margarita. As complex and crazy as the story is, the film does not leave anything aside. It is as if the filmmaker read Bulgakov's work in the same way that an orchestra conductor reads a score, without missing a note. Why can not we find so much talent here in the United States? So now my favorite book and movie have the same title.
