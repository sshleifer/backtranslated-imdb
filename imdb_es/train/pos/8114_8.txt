If the scientists behaved in a way that H.G. Wells was confident that they would do so in the future, the story would not have turned out exactly as it did in Things To Come. It was almost 80 years beyond the point at which Wells wrote The Way of Things to Come, on which this film is based and is no closer to the world he describes, in some more distant aspects. <br /> <br /> Although well-known players such as Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are in the cast, they are more caricatures than real characters. It's the main weakness of the film, it's dedicated to Wells's philosophy of science, it will solve all the problems and the rest of us are fools. <br /> <br /> Massey characters, two generations of the same family hold that highly optimistic vision. Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels that the man is moving too fast. And Ralph Richardson is a warlord born of the destruction of another Thirty Years' War fought with modern weapons. By the way, as the atomic bomb had not been invented, it was considered that poisonous gas was a weapon that almost destroyed humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, science and conquest can never be mixed. Scientists as a group are far above the world of politics to participate in such things. In Wells' life, scientists fled the right-wing fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini. Those same people, however, to defeat them, were subordinated to the Allies and designed the atomic weapons that marked the beginning of the modern era. If they behaved like Wells would have liked, someone like Albert Einstein would have headed a meeting of scientists who would have established a new order after World War II. <br /> <br /> Wells was wrong in both time and development. Apparently, he never imagined the computer as well as the atomic power. Computer programmers are much more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at this time. Still Things To Come, helped by William Cameron Menzies and the sets created, offers an interesting insight into the mind of H.G. Wells, a respected thinker of his time, although he did not have the correct form of Things To Come.
