History has many holes, perhaps due to the demands of studio executives who did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read some of the opinions sent to IMDB comparing Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when they should be all those directors who should be considered as followers. of the great teacher himself. No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. The lucky thing is that we still have his legacy, whether in hindsight, like the one that just finished the Film Forum in New York, or his films on tape or DVD. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth was never photographed with more love. that here If she was a beauty with her red hair, like a blonde, she is too impressive for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have made this film another masterpiece that was added to the work of Orson Welles, was his own appearance in it.
