*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie, "The Divers", is really interesting. The only thing I knew about it was that it would involve Nazi history, underwater scenes and they would all speak Danish. But I decided to check it out for a reason, the fact that the story evolves around a German submarine of World War II sunk. I have a fetish for German submarines, especially shipwrecks that can be dived. So I was a bit skeptical about the Danish side, but I reasoned that the submarine could weigh that part. Knowing that Nordic movies are not always so good and I'm not sure of the size of the budget I had, to put it in some way, very skeptical. <br /> <br /> When I saw him I ... I was surprised. <br /> <br /> I had some thoughts about the actors that are inadequate, seeing how some are very young, the two main actors in particular. This was not a problem, both perform very well. Like the other actors, who are mostly people 50 and older. This makes for an interesting interaction between young and old, it is not often seen on the screen. It is not unique anyway, but something strange. And everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Regarding the Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But this was not a problem, it had subtitles. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the submarine itself, I suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater shots of the submarine. Having decided that their budget was tight, I thought that this could be appropriate at best and bad at worst. Once again I was surprised, the exterior scenes of the shipwreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for German submarines, I knew what the submarine should be like, especially inside, and I was not disappointed. The team has done a serious investigation. Everything is fine. <br /> <br /> I suspect that more people than me will see this movie just to see some scenes of submarines, so I feel I should issue a "warning". The submarine in the film is not a real model that existed during the war. It is a special sub-purpose. But to give you an idea of ​​what to expect, it's a cross between a Type VII, Type IX and a Japanese transport sub similar to I-52. God is a good design and makes a good shipwreck. <br /> <br /> The setting is on an island or Danish peninsula, I do not remember. It's summer and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the arrival of summer as they do every year. Your grandfather is a kind of sailor. The photography is quite pleasant, many beautiful summer scenes on the docks of the island, a bit of newly discovered teenage love, a pleasant climate for diving and a general feeling of "perfect". Once again, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the island receives some visitors of the suspect type, a men's meeting hires one of the boats, an old mine sweeper and his crew. One of the visitors, a man in his 50s, is tattooing the German eagle and the swastika on his back. All the elders of the island remember when a German submarine sank towards the end of World War II and since then there have been rumors of Nazi gold in the depths. The grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken submarine shortly after the German bodies began floating on land in 1945. No submarines were ever found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO EXPECT <br /> </ /> The key elements are the Nazi experiments, the Nazi history, the treasure hunt, the secret, the competition, the teenage love, the conspiracy and .. . a surprise. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I did not expect some supernatural elements to appear in this movie and it surprised me. Not being a big fan of supernatural events, however, it fitted well into the story and does not pose any problem. It's not like "From dusk to dawn," where everyone becomes a vampire towards the end. This is a little more subtle. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL: Very good movie, I gave it an 8. Some due to the fact that it is not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. I found out later that I had a fair budget and that some of the actors were experienced Danish veterans. But even if this had been a Hollywood production, I would give it a 7 or 8. It's definitely worth it. Yes, a children's story in a certain way, but again a mature story. It has a lot of suspense and a great aura of adventures, which I found very attractive. And, once again, the cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
