Emma is a true romance. If you love good things, full of wit and madness, you will love this movie! It is true to the novel, which is very important, with some changes added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my favorite actresses, but she does justice to a role that required everything she had to offer. She shines in a role that I think no other actress could have done to the proper justice. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, as the hero. How surprised you are. I never saw him so openly handsome, but heck! What the right paper can do for you! He looks as good as the sensible and regal Mr. K, who is literally looking at him from a new perspective. He makes excellent romantic leadership. The charm and character you bring to your paper is wonderful! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi, brings the rest. A good cast A good movie. If you're a Jane Austen fan, watch this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice, and most importantly, buy the books. Improve the film to heights that are extraordinary.
