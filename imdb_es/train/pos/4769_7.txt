I am sure that this is a show that nobody is familiar with and may not think about it well; after all, it is almost near Baywatch Hawaii. With the cast, the location, the style of the address and its publicity. It shows women walking on the beach and all that. It is not surprising that people have a wrong concept and decide not to see it. <br /> <br /> It was a mistake of them to do that. Because after I decide to watch the show, in reality there are more things happening, a really juicy story and conflict, which turn out to be really exciting to watch and more or less? addictive. <br /> <br /> The history of the hotel employees, the manager, the owner and their complicated love life. Also enter the problematic visitor of the hotel and the powerful man who tries to steal the hotel. Actually, it's more exciting than it seems here. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that the performance is bad, but it is not so bad that you look away. The story is not so consistent but good enough. The soundtrack fits quite well with the stage and the action is all the time. I took a couple of episodes before something really solid happens, so be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really enjoy watching this. Zillion Times is better than expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Rating: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my review after reading it, thanks.
