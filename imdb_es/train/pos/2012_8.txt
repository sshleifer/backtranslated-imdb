This is one of my favorites of all time. Good music and some funny tricks. Every time I laugh at Millie, the maid pretends to be a debutante, holding her delicate handkerchief while chatting, and polishing the furniture without thinking as she talks. I can never just ignore your French accent. It was never a problem, as they try to pass it off as the boss's daughter. <br /> <br /> Seeing a teenager Mel Torme and the very young Frank Sinatra singing is a real pleasure. My mother saw Frank Sinatra in a theater almost at the same time that this movie came out. She said that they could not erase the "bobby-soxers" between the movies (in those days you did not have to go between the presentations). This movie shows you how attractive and attractive young Frank was and allows you to appreciate his initial talent as well. And Victor Borge gets a bit into his routine, which is an advantage. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with a sweet and simple story. Very nice.
