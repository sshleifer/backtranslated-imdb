Although it has not been seen in too many movies before, it has certainly seen the basic themes of the plot in too many films since then. <br /> <br /> Neither one of Grant or Loy's best movies, they make an exceptional effort together. After all, with so much talent and a very good cast of support, you know that the laughs will be there. <br /> <br /> The film is light, has some dramatic spots but keeps the plot moving and makes you smile all over. through. <br /> <br /> A great example of the classic American cinema fare that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Final rate on Saturday afternoon, plenty of popcorn.
