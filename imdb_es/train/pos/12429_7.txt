David Duchovny plays the leading role in this film. Now, many people to discover that fact would not even bother to see it. Very unfair to say the least. David made his name in the X files and is a decent actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a doctor addicted to drugs who was fired for malpractice. By pure chance he became a private doctor of the millionaire criminal Raymond Blossom. However, the FBI is interested in using Eugene to catch Blossom. Angelina Jolie is chosen for the supporting role of Clare-The Gangster Moll. She performs a solid performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is excellent and immersed himself deeply in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people would think and, in the end, he would rate his performance as credible. Its monotonous and familiar tone is present, but it does not distract too much attention from the film.
