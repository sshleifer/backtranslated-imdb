You can do a lot with a little money. Blair Witch proved it. This movie supports it. It is nothing more than a comedy of length and complexity. However, because he has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes, he manages to be funny even with a budget that he can not afford to spend a lot of money on. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe, since the sincere and clumsy Watson, its darkness and slowness restrain Cleese's wit. If you ever run into the movie, look at it for a peculiar laugh or two.
