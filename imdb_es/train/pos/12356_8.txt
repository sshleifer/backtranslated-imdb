Contrary to the summaries of some people, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. They are oiran (prostitutes) who live outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of Tokugawa women. I can not say that the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in how typical they are. The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the art direction and the acting. I felt that I was glimpsing a moment and a place I could never glimpse. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main voice, were very exciting to watch. I would only recommend this film to people who want to try Japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. It is a great example of both.
