For Columbo fans, like me, this is the episode episode that explained why Columbo was so popular and how good he really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (as always) playing the ingenious and intelligent crime novelist Abigail Mitchell. It seems that Abigail calls his nephew to sign some papers that make him his heir. She never overcame the death of her niece, and is convinced that the husband of her dead niece (Charles Frank) did the dirty action. Saying more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a cunning role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbo is in a class by itself. It's a really well-made television movie. I highly recommend it.
