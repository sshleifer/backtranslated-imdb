<br /> <br /> I disagree with the other critic's comments for the simple reason that this is a MYSTERY MOVIE, not a supernatural one. It is not the only movie that has an apparently "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but it turns out to be very mundane. <br /> <br /> Other films that come to mind are "Before Dawn by Edgar Wallace". "and the (more famous)" Vampire Mark ". <br /> <br /> The film does a WONDERFUL job creating a" spooky atmosphere ", similar to DRACULA, when Renfield meets the Count on the staircase his castle, or in MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, when the two people look through the windows of the castle ruins and see a "corpse" playing an organ, while Luna descends with wings! VERY surreal! <br / > <br /> If one likes these atmospheric touches (often silent), THIS movie is MUST! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel
