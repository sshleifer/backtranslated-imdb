"Nothing, there's nothing" in Room 237. But anyway, you do not have any business, so stay out. <br /> <br /> There has never been such a feat of psychological horror as this film accomplishes. This is the best rated horror movie of all and rightly so. Jack Nicholson is an excellent actor and this is one of the best performances in cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a family that moves to an isolated and abandoned hotel for 5 months during the winter. Then the father (Jack) is almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel. <br /> <br /> The address of Kubricks is nothing short that perfect. The tension of the follow-up shots, the dying music, the mystical messages and the disconcerting plot make this the best horror film ever made. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film there are constant references to danger, death and horror. Red is used in EVERY scene. Is red intentionally put by Kubrick? Of course. <br /> <br /> This is a definitive Kubrick classic and this is the third of his films that I have given on 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see him in all his films. He loves to confuse his viewers in each of his films. <br /> <br /> I will talk about this movie during the next months. It has an infinite depth. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10
