The year is 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. There is only one friend he has and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), a nice man. With a herd of cattle you are running a herd of cattle. That would be your key to wealth. In Skagway they encounter problems when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle. Now Jeff just has to retrieve it and drive it across the US border. UU to Dawson. Now they have a group of other people with them, like the ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). There the two men get involved in the gold business. The fourth collaboration of Anthony Mann and James Stewart, The Far Country (194) is a good western. The acting work is excellent. Walter Brennan is an excellent partner for Stewart. Ruth Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet is charming. Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris. The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in smaller roles. It's fantastic to see how Jimmy Stewart overcame it. The problems are on his way. There's only the man and his rifle. But he is also vulnerable.
