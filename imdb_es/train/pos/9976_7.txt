Sure, it was cheesy and pointless and, at times, corny, but at least the filmmakers did not try. While most television movies are on the verge of mediocrity, this film has some redeeming qualities. The cinematography was pretty good for a television movie, and Viggo Mortensen shows the tones of Aragorn in a movie about a man who played his own rules. Most of the flashback sequences were somewhat corny, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I got a little mad about the role of Jason Priestly in the movie as a rebel sportsman, but, again, it's a TV MOVIE! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona in a prominent place in the movie.
