The silent film "Pride of the Clan," starring Mary Pickford, was supposed to be set on a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. Actually, most of the exterior shots were filmed at Marblehead Massachusett in Marblehead Neck, near several rocky coastal geographic areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the location of the movie Marblehead in my hometown and, 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a substitute for Mary Pickford during the filming of several scenes, including The "cliff scene". Both women were small (5 ') in height and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was an understudy with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the Chiefton film set. I just wanted to tell this story for future historians and filmmakers. The film itself (my DVD copy is somewhat poor) is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting, including several scenes in which Miss Pickford portrays a characterization of a strong woman. I enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy, although I'm not sure if it exists, as I have seen in several movie sites, that the remaining copies are dark due to deterioration. A very good silent genre movie with lots of action!
