In fact, I like this movie, although I do not like James Belushi very much. In this film, you can actually see several important names on the rise, such as Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox; Caine's was already big, of course. The plot in this movie is simple; It's like that movie on the sliding door. However, it was told in a happy way and I like the moments of comedy it contains. It made me try to relive my own important moments in life, for example, what would happen if I had taken that girl to a movie and not to the other, etc. It tells us that the people around us could have taken different roles in our lives if some of the minute details needed to change. It also reminds us to be careful with what we want. Life is not always as good on the other side as we think; Maybe, what we have now is the best for us, considering all things.
