['Students often ask me why I choose this version of Othello. Shakespeare&#39;s text is heavily truncated and the film contains material that earned him an &quot;R&quot; rating. <br /><br /> I have several reasons for using this production: first, I had not seen a representation of the Moor that really made me sympathize with Othello until I saw Fishburne play it. I saw James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer play Othello and Iago on Broadway, and it was wonderful. The energy of Plummer was especially remarkable. But despite Jone&#39;s incredible physical and vocal presence, the character he played seemed too passive to be unlawful to me, a complete emotional purge in the Aristotelian sense. Jones, in fact, affirmed what I felt when, in an interview, he noticed that he had interpreted Othello as passive, since he saw Iago basically as the one who was overcoming it. Unfortunately, this exhausted my sorrow for the destruction of the character. Therefore, I felt sympathy for the Moor of Jone but not the horror of his corruption by an evil man. In contrast, Fishburne&#39;s Othello is a strong and vigorous figure, familiar with the action. Therefore, Iago&#39;s temptation to actively deal with what is presented to Othello as his wife&#39;s infidelity is a perversion of the general&#39;s positive quality to be active, not passive.1 The horror of the story is that this good quality in Othello becomes perverted. The representation of Fishburne is, therefore, classically tragic. <br /><br /> Second, Fishburne is the first black actor to play Othello in a movie. Both Orsen Wells and Anthony Hopkins made good film versions, but they were white men with black faces.2 Why is this important? Why should a black actor be the black man on stage? 3 Certainly, on Shakespeare&#39;s day, they wore the black face in the same way they used children to make girls. Maybe then, the reason is the same. Female actors bring special quality to female roles on the Shakespearean stage because they better understand what the genius of Shakespeare was trying to present. A gifted black actor must play the moor because his experience in a white-dominated culture is vital to understanding what Shakespeare&#39;s genius recognized: the pain of being marginalized on the grounds of race. An important issue in Othello is the isolation caused by racism. Although it is a mistake to insert American racism into a Shakespeare play, there is no doubt that racism still works among the characters. Many, including Desdimona&#39;s father, think that a union between a white Venetian Christian woman and a black Christian man from North Africa is DENATURAL. <br /><br /> Third, Shakespeare was never rated G Never has been. His theatrical productions were always characterized by violence and strong language. But the genius of Shakespeare uses these elements not as sensationalism but for artistic honesty.']
