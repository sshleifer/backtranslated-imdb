I rented this a few years ago, the video store only had VHS at that time. The correct thing for the video was its advance (you know, where the covers of the boxes use the same source and the colors of the successful films). I did not know what to expect, other than what had been printed. The first thing I thought while looking was "what the hell is wrong with the sound?" - Obviously there was no dubbing of dialogues. The words echoed, so I stopped chewing what I had to pay more attention to, keep in mind that there is no Shakespeare here, just a simple chat! The story is quite simple, the boy meets the girl, etc. What I found humorous and sincere was that the people in the film did not look like caricatures written in the story, but that they were not actors who had been temporarily removed from their real jobs (uniforms). included). All the time, you start to feel what the filmmaker is looking for, and then you see that there are no cheap humor attempts (people who hurt their private, using vulgarities could not have affected the marketing.) There was something honest about it. If they had a bigger budget, then it would have been better, which I'm sure they considered daily, but they did it, I think that's what independent film is about. "Indy", it's like a Genre ... Ha ! That's funny!
