Kurt Russell, whose career began when he kicked the REAL Elvis in It Happened At the World Fair, will probably never surpass his performance as the King in this biopic directed by the slash and shock carpenter. There are times when you feel that you are seeing Elvis until something brings you back to reality ... perhaps the memories of a hapless Don Johnson in Elvis and the Queen of Beauty? All the performances here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as the Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to her portrayal of Momma Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurt's father, Bing, is playing. Elvis 'father Vernon, and there is a discreet performance of Robert Gray as Elvis' friend and bodyguard, Red West. <br /> <br /> A must see for rock n roll fans.
