Having the opportunity to see part of the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area, I could not wait to see his final copy. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie in the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I have not laughed out loud in a comedy in a long time! It's a great slapstick. The Russo Brothers did a good job directing. The whole cast performs its best comic performance ... Without slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and is great as the sure breaker in this movie. William H. Macy was the most perverse when the thief "Riley" and the one of Michael Jeter as "Toto" keep you "stitching". I think they have the funniest roles in the whole movie.
