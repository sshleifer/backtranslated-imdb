It is projected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. The projected figure is higher in sub-Saharan Africa, where an additional 55 million deaths can be expected. Beyond the grim statistics there are personal stories that we rarely hear. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving films of Close to Leo, produced for French television, as part of a series that deals with issues related to young people. Although fictional, it is a situation that is unfortunately too common: the effect of the diagnosis of HIV in a close family of love. <br /> <br /> When Leo (Pierre Mignard), 21, says his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) who has AIDS, the family is devastated. Due to concern for their youth, they decide to withhold information from their younger brother, Marcel (Yannis Lespert), aged 12, but he hears the conversation and starts to get angry and act erratically. When Leo goes to Paris to receive treatment, he takes Marcel with him, but the young man confronts Leo and demands to know the truth. Leo tells him he is sick and Marcel is sad but accepts. However, when he takes Marcel to meet some old gay friends, the tension between them is reduced to the surface, setting the stage for a fascinating conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I felt uncomfortable with the scenes in bed that involve physical contact between the brothers, I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances of Lespert and Mignard more than tip the balance to their favor. Seeing the events that take place from the young man's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminds me of the Quebecois film, Leolo, and The 400 Truffaut hits. Unlike some American movies that dance around the anguish of AIDS, Near Leo says a harsh truth, but it does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real.
