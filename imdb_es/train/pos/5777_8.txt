A meteor crashes on Crater Lake, the heat of impact causes a prehistoric egg to hatch. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the plot is just garbage. But despite its obvious low budget, this is presented as one of the most fascinating and entertaining moving monster movies that exist. There are also some good moments of humor. It is refreshing to discover that, in a time full of so-called "monsters", they are nothing more than creations of men in funny laughing suits or lizards disguised and forced to break one another (cheap exploitation style). The Plesiosaurus in this little gem is an excellent movement movement creature in the style of Harryhausen. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty hard movie to find, but it's worth finding.
