This supernatural thriller by Peter Weir is truly one of the most fascinating and fascinating films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his best work here as the Australian lawyer defending a group of young aborigines accused of murder. As you get closer to the case, find out more about the main defendant, Chris, and not just about himself. Chris tells him he is a Mulkurul, who seems to be a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, an extraordinary rain seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the arrival of LAST WAVE, which will drown the world. <br /> <br /> Dream sequences and supernatural effects enhance this film and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in supporting roles, as is the guy with the difficult name who plays Charlie, the former aborigine who can become an owl. The climax and the ending do not disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers that collapse after a promising hour. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is also a drama and speaks of spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterpiece by Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
