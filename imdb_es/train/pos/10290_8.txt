Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's best work since The Truman Show, and it was a pleasant surprise after his recent "Hey Hollywood: How well I can act!" Box office disappointments. It's great to see Jim recognizing and embracing his strengths. He will not receive an Academy Award, but the film itself will last longer than many of the Academy's "award-winning films." He is at his best in this most recent movie, it's like the return of an old friend. <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman and Aniston do a great job together: they feel comfortable in their comedy roles, excellent comedic moment, and obviously having fun together but without the kind of comedy "hey mom, look how funny I am". A real surprise was Steven Carrell as the enemy of Carrey (Carrell of The Daily Show), who took some of the best and funniest scenes of the film. I laughed more at Carell than anyone else in the last three years. <br /> <br /> I can foresee that the religious madmen in the United States will be above God's treatment, but the bottom line of the film is faithful to all the main theological beliefs: we are masses of protoplasms that try overcome our short lives by exercising our free will. Without being married to children to complain about, this is likely to become a target for people with poorly placed priorities (who know the guys: men adorned with gold watches on Sunday morning and the last hour of television, selling prayers to God). And, again, about 0.5% of the country will be concerned and 80% of the media will report it. <br /> <br /> The conclusion: this is a purely entertaining movie, each member of the audience laughs wondering what they would do. and a sense of well-being at the conclusion of the film. A walk on any major street in the United States has to confirm that God has a tremendous sense of humor. What a comic book genius to remind us of that Jim Carry!
