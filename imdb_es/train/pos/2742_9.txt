Richard Brooks, excellent 1967 movie from Truman's novel IN COLD BLOOD, is a perfect piece for the Oscar-winning performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman at the 2005 CAPOTE. They really play well together (try them on separate nights). It is unusual to find movies made 38 years apart that fit so well. These two really improve each other. Although different actors play the roles of assassins Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces combine well. Only the part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in the Brooks films is weaker, since they give Capote a different name. I would suggest seeing CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It is a powerful experience!
