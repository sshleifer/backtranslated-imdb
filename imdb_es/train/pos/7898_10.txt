This film received terrible criticism, but as it was unconventional and as the critics do not usually "take out" out of the ordinary movies, I thought about trying it. Unfortunately, in this case they were very right. <br /> <br /> The movie also has an uncomfortable feeling, which is most unpleasant. The kind of feeling that is impossible to describe, but not good. To make things even more confusing, the script is a dull meaningless thing that is only vaguely interesting. <br /> <br /> The immensely talented Thurman simply moves through this mess, creating hardly an impact. Hurt and Bracco try in vain to add something to the film with an enthusiastic interpretation but there is nothing in the script. It may have been less shameful for them if they had chosen to simply drift and overcome it as Thurman. <br /> <br /> One thing that the "esteemed" film critics did not mention, however, is that the film is actually quite funny. Either in moments of precise satire or extravagantly strange moments, like when the cowgirls in question chase Hurt out of his ranch with the smell of his dirty clothes ... ahem ... front bottoms. <br /> <br /> Because of the Chortles achieved at all times, although I would not recommend this movie, there's entertainment that you can watch and see Even Cowgirls Get the Blues worth for something different.
