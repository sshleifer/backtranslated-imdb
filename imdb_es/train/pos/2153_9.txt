This movie was lovely. An accountant wants more of life than approved conventional success. What makes it work so well, and what makes it so different from the standard dance movie, is that it's not really about becoming "Big" but it's just about finding a way to express yourself. The great triumph at the end is not winning a contest, it is not discovering a completely new lifestyle, but the simple joy of doing what you want to accomplish the other parts of your life. No one is discovering his passion, he is finding his soul calm. <br /> <br /> The Japanese background makes subtle oppression and the "secret life" of ballroom dancing understandable and personal. We can all see ourselves in the common man.
