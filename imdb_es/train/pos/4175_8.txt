I always wondered what happened to that kind of magical feeling that old Slovenian movies seemed to have in them ... Well, eventually I wondered if that feeling was just nostalgia. Or that "feeling" decided to pack their bags and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our film history, and then never came back? Or did he? Because for me, it came back the first time I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres". And it was his old self again. <br /> <br /> There are three qualities of this film that make it something unique and as fun as watching it: the smooth flow of the story, the warmth of the colors and, what I appreciated the most: the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (something that many other Slovenian writers (not only) should consider at least). There is no use of words, when they can be understood as well (yes, or better) by other means in use. Just look at Bakovic and Cerar. Uh <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, it's the reason why I would recommend "Ekspres, Ekspres" to all of you, like a Slovenian movie a must-see, regardless of what you've heard about Slovenian. movies (if you've ever heard something, that's ...). <br /> <br /> Oh, and that scene, where Bakovic dances with the music of Vivaldi ... A gift. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Look at it.
