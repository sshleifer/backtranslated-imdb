['What an absolutely amazing movie, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, look at it, you will not regret it, it&#39;s very funny! Rajnikanth carries the film on his shoulders and although there is nothing more than him, I still like it. The music of ARRehman takes time to grow in you, but after having listened to it a few times, you really start to like it.']
