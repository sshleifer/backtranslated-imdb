If you erase the first twenty minutes of this movie, you will be left with a fantastic comedy. As it is, it still seemed like a pretty good movie, which is no small thing considering the coma in which the initial scenes were put. To put it mildly, this movie has a grim start that was not even remotely funny, not even optimistic. However, once things get stupider, you're left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades. It's definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who want to see your previous work.
