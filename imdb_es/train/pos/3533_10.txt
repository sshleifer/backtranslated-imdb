Unfortunately, it's not available on DVD yet, but it's worth it to follow it on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes that her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and bravely takes many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleys, none of which I will mention! The sequence of the jazz band in which our heroine seeks information about the killer is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, although it has a very low budget and was made during the Second World War in white and black. Despite the low budget, Long Island seems a little mountainous, this is an original style movie and an exceptional vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew a lot about these issues, and chose the firmest women (Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan) of her time. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers (Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc.) who emigrated to Hollywood and brought a very original new vision. Unfortunately, Ella Raines was never given such an important part again, and eventually ended up in low production westerns.
