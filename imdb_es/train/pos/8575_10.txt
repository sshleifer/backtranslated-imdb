This is a movie that I can watch again and again and I never get tired of it, it has a lot of laughs, weapons, action, crime, good lines and a decent plot, with an over the top, Donald Sutherland in A pretty funny role as a Assasain Tia Carerra looks as good as ever and can act too, Thomas Ian Griffin is great at this as the main character "Max", a DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow de Frazier in television. The bad boy, "Livingston." The plot centers around Max and Diane who try to capture Livingston while fighting and arguing with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies, throws to the mix Assassain Sutherland, who has practically all the good lines, this is the Perfect Criminal Caper, is the usual love story, but interpreted very differently than you think by Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian mafia, the Italian mafia and the Chinese mafia here. The film was filmed in Boston, where you have some great shots, and the locals, excellent photography and music in this movie, this film is only the epitome of a criminal comedy, it has everything one could wish for. Take a look at Sutherland's bathroom in a particular scene, very unusual. This movie is a riot and it will make you laugh a lot more than 10 for me.
