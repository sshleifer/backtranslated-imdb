It turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from dwarves with an ax to 7m ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the drivers, not too sentimental but romantic enough to maintain interest. I also liked the mix of humor (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much / not enough), which means it did not get too dark or too deceiving. It was a great step forward with respect to other efforts of Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of history and production. They have a great website that is worth checking out. I can not wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
