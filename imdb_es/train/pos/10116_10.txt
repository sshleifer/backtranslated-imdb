An excellent and accurate film ... McGovern makes great efforts to research and document his writings and it's worth it. He is not afraid to tell the truth, even though he may generate unfavorable criticism and comments from some who like the stories to be clean, sweet and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Once again, McGovern brings Christopher Eccleston, though not in such a high profile a role as he played in Hillsborough. I found this film so precise, well acted and well presented as Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern for his moving writing without apology. Well done and I take my hat off before the writer, the actors, the production team. A great movie!
