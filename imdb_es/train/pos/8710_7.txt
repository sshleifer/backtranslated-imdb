I remember this program on Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and it scared me beyond what I believed. <br /> <br /> I would love to revisit this series and see if it was as excellent as I remember, although I suspect that my taste and my demands have changed. <br /> <br /> Although this was published before Alien and a plethora of other space thrillers, I suspect that it has its roots in horror movies of the 50s: and the political climate of the 70s: s. When I think about it, this was a true science fiction, a film that tries to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term science fiction has become bleak and has become the term for any movie that has spaceships.
