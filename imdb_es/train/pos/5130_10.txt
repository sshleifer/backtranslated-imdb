['... it may seem like an exaggeration, but it is not. <br /><br /> What is so hard to understand is: why did not they make more musical shorts like this one? Was not the beauty of this totally evident to everyone involved? I suppose not. So many shorts were made only for commercial reasons, and with some luck there may be some artistic value there. This is an exception, the only one? - Where it seems that they were, the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate music as art. Why did not anyone think of shooting Lester or Charlie Parker on a live date? Crazy man. <br /><br /> Too bad there are no sequels. If you have seen something of similar quality, please share it!']
