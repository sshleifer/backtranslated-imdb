Hidden Frontiers is more than fan fiction, it is a well thought out and organized series that keeps the Star Trek world alive and growing. From a small and fun fan project until now a well-known series of networks; Hidden Frontiers has something for every Star Trek fan. Hidden Frontier tackles the issues and problems raised in other Star Trek series with stories of characters using characters, diagrams and arcs of well-developed stories. Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken on stories of social context that Gene Roddenberry could not bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long-term spatial assignments: the real things that happen in nearby places, as well as an exciting war and space conflicts . -Love addicts know and love. Done in a "Green Screen" studio; Hidden Frontiers brings to your screen a lot of regulars on the screen and in your hearts. The great cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. The inventive use of green screen technology, accessories, makeup and costumes work to make the worlds of the Star Trek Hidden Frontier fun and credible. Hidden Frontier has gone where few step to go in the world of science fiction, and prospered once they got there. Hidden Frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought-out website, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat. I recommend taking the time to download and see.
