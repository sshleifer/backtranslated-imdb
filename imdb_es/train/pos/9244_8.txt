If you only read a synopsis of the plot, this movie would seem quite typical of the thirties. The story seems quite artificial, the main theme is maudlin. The strength and beauty of this film are found in the direct and earthly interpretations of the cast. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow exhibit a range of feelings, rich and subtle nuances on his face. If you look at their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such a deep feeling among the main characters. The raw emotions are so candidly portrayed, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably moving: when Clark Gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son, he picks it up and proudly says: "My child!", I could not help remembering that Mr. Gable's own son was born for him posthumously. This is one of the best examples of cinema from the time of the depression.
