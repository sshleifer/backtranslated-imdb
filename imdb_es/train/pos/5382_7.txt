After watching the reality television series of Next Action Star, I was pleased to see the movie of the winners immediately. I distrusted such a showcase of new talents, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Billy Zane, of course, was his usual great personality, but Corinne and Sean stayed by his side. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their special roles. Sean's character, not Billy's, is the hunted, and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well understood. Corinne walks well on the tightrope between her character that Sean likes and is only in this for the money. I loved how the game was played until the last second. And then beyond! It is not a great movie, but an entertaining one so far and a great showcase for two people in its first time at the door.
