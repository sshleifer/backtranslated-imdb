Debut? Wow: Cross-Eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable independent films I've seen in the last year, which makes it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the writer's debut film. I mean, I logged into IMDb to find more of this writer's movies ... because Cross Eyed has that unique signature: you want to see what else this writer might have to say. These days, it is rare to see a film that is well written, well directed, well edited and performed. For me, Cross Eyed summarizes what film creation is all about: combining the best of all the elements of the film to create an intelligent, artistic and moving story. More, please.
