This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy genre of the 80s, which is my favorite genre of all, so when I saw it was Free on Demand, I had to see it! It stars Caroline Munro, from the two films of Dr. Phibes (it was his wife who died!), Dracula AD 1972, The Golden Journey of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac and faceless. <Br /> <br /> Presented by the people behind Do not Open Til Christmas and Pieces, Heres my thoughts on this ... <br /> <br /> April Fools' Day opens, A group of children plays an elaborate joke on the school nerd, promising sex in the shower and giving him public humiliation and a face on the toilet (all while naked!). The coach stops him, but both parties swear revenge. But, the cool guys end up burning the nerd alive. <br /> <br /> Cut for the future, and it's the high school reunion, or so you think (bwahahha?). The only ones with invitations were the gang that burned the boy and his Day of the Innocents (or really, the day before the Innocents, but the fun begins at midnight), but they do not see the coincidence and they pass the time in front of the School until the evening. Then they finally enter the school and begin to assault. <br /> <br /> Inside they find food / drink and a small sanctuary for each of them, each of their closets and belongings, along with Marty's locker (the nerds). and yearbook. They also find the old black caretaker / caretaker who spends his time saying "Oooh yesser! Yesser! I do not want any problems, sir!" and then it kills instantly. Pretty useless character, but it's still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a page out of Alien's book, in a deliciously bloody way that you just have to see! That's when everyone realizes they're there to die, and they start going crazy, except for Shirley, who decides it would be better to take a bath in the old-school showers at a time like this. Of course, she spills blood and acid, and her face melts (very well, of course) The rest of the night goes on as usual, sex, drugs and Marty kill everyone while wearing a jester mask. What is your plan? "All we have to do is stay awake and wait until noon, Marty will not kill us at noon." Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently you can only kill at night. But will they survive all night? Who will live and who will die? And why are all bodies disappearing? Rent, buy or steal this great movie to discover it! The film is actually very good, full of clich√©s (the car does not start, DAMMIT!) And it's just a fun slasher. Not to mention that they all have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to all of you! And, not to mention, it has a Spin Off! The court class of 1989 is a consequence of this slasher gem, and that movie begins the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: 2 people having sex, the boy wants to finish but the girl does not do it "Talk dirty to me, Frank!" she screams "uh ... boobs!" "DIRECTOR!" "Uh ... boobs, F * ck, Tits, Boobs, F * ck." It seems to work for her and in her climax, the killer electrocutes them both!
