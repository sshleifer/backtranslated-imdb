I am surprised by the low IMDb rating of this movie. With all due respect, its low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it as low. They would rather see a movie with cheap emotions, a bigger budget and more gore. <br /> <br /> The first misconception of people is that this is a horror movie. It is not, nor does the movie deceive you into believing it is one. It's a psychological thriller. It is for people who really want an intellectual experience when they watch a movie. The review of Reel.com is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All the other negative reviews do not make much sense. It's almost as if trying to make an original film for a change, something very rare these days, is something bad and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I will reveal some spoilers for idiots who said it was boring and they did not. it does not make sense Martha washed her brain and experimented with herself to be a loving mother, while in reality she was an evil Nazi who would kill without warning. The evidence is in the pudding and the fact that upon seeing it for the first time, sympathizing with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the film is a testament to the direction and writing of the film. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this film should at least be classified in the range of 6 only because of its originality. I recommend this movie for people at the other end of the IQ scale, also known as intelligent people, since obviously this movie is being killed by those who prefer to see Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the performance too. For a movie with such a low budget, you're surprised that this movie has not hit your local cinema with great direction, writing and acting. Please, do not be fooled by the IMDb rating. This movie is worth it. In fact, I recommend buying the movie, since a first time you see a rental will not do it justice.
