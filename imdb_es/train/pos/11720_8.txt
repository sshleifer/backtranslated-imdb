I did not expect much, and, to be honest, I did not like this movie the first time, but I saw it again and I realized that it's something great. Sure, it's a joke movie, but it's a funny joke. <br /> <br /> Someone posted that it could be better written and could be. I think this movie had the potential to be a cousin on My Cousin Vinny. But with a horror host instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately it is a missed opportunity. With just a little more writing it could be a classic. Children are underutilized, there is no reason why they should hold onto Elvira. Apart from the obvious reasons. It would have been great to see your relationship blossom. I know it's a comedy, but it's the small differences that separate good movies from brilliant ones. <br /> <br /> Elvira in itself is always fun and attractive. Not to mention the flirtatious. Every time she smiles you will too. It's hard to hit a movie when the main character is so charming. And it really is his charm, do not let his appearance fool you into believing that it is a kind of cake. Well, she is. But she is a good one. The kind of person you would let take care of your children. However, I would not let her cook for them ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend trying it. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> She is more than a big set of tits. She is also a pair of incredible legs.
