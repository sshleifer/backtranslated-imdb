I would love to give Kolchak a higher rating, but the show quickly went from fear / suspense to foolish. Blame for ABC They moved the show on Friday nights at 8:00 p.m., which is known as the "family time." I should never have been on Friday in the first place. I was a sophomore in high school and I loved the first episodes! It was for the first time against the policewoman on the NBC network. ABC had big problems with Friday nights. Bad season for them until Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT debuted in January '75. Kolchak should have been a success. Darren McGavin begged him to leave his contract to finish the program. Too bad the writing was not up to Richard Matheson's in the original television movies. Still, McGavin made Kolchak his own, as the actors can. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker come to mind. That INS established with manual typewriters and teletype types seems strange and ancient nowadays, however, that was part of the appeal. They were very lucky to have Simon Oakland reprise "Vincenzo" from the television movies.
