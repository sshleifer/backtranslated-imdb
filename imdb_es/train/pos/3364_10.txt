I was also quite surprised to see how many people had voted in this film, and I HAD to write something about it, although my comments are quite similar to those already written. <br /> <br /> I like many things about the movie. The superb performance between Mastroianni and Loren. The way in which the film is narrated: humanity and love slowly develop between these two outsiders, and are contrasted with the rhythm of simultaneous and continuous inhuman march of the fascist radio announcer (who is a colleague of Mastroianni's side) and the fans that are coming and going from the show. "For me this is a very good movie about what it is to be human, maybe some of you would say that the antifascist" message "is too clear, but for me this did not destroy the movie No way, my vote is 10/10.
