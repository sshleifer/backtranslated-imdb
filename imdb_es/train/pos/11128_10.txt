First of all I would like to say how good this is. It is amazing and sometimes shocking. And at least I'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring movie, but this is anything but boring. It's like a journey through humanity. Its realism is manifested through this monumental masterpiece. It is a heartbreaking story of two down and outers (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) that build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT), a naive Texan stallion who comes to New York to enrich himself by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man who can barely pay the rent. Ratso becomes Joe's "manager", but soon both men can not find Joe a job that results in food theft. While trying to survive on the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. They can not get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe earns some money and soon Joe takes Ratso to a dream place in Ratso, Florida. The last five minutes are heartbreaking but some of the best moments of the movie. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we obtain an urban vision of the austere and sometimes disturbing life.
