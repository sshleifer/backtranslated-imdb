To my surprise, I really enjoyed the last installment of Disney animation. The film had its minimum, but in general I felt that the story was strong and that it was easy to relate to the characters. It was also nice to see a Disney animated movie that was not a musical. I was about to be pushed to the limit with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the music a break. Another good feature of the film is that the comedy was not completely overwhelmed (to the Hercules), but rather subtle, so it still made the children laugh without making the adults feel dizzy or just stupid. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films that occur outside of Disney studios, you would think they would move and catch up. There is something to be said about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the history of Atlantis. In general, the film was entertaining and definitely worth a trip to multiplexing. <br /> <br />
