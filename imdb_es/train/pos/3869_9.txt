I've seen the movie in Vienna a few years ago, where the audience liked it. I also liked it, Summer Phoenix's performance still haunts me, so I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in London around 1900, where a Jewish girl decides to become an actress. She desperately tries to become one, but it is not before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage, that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger human being. <br /> <br /> There was some criticism, where her performance was crushed, she was accused of being bored, of not being able to give life to her character. I think that's her strong point, which is exactly what Esther Kahn should be and Phoenix makes a brave decision to make her a pretty boring girl. So your transformation in the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is excellent, the images of London at the end of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant was life back then. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only flaw is the duration of the movie, you lose contact with the characters, after all, it's just about finding the actor in yourself, so there are no actions dramatic in the movie. . It's Phoenix's credit that we do not lose interest in the movie after the first hour.
