After watching several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers completely lack any form of originality. Here is an old science fiction resource, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept, and yet they can only, almost, make it work. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good! Male actors are reasonably proficient in their professions. Most of the characters are well drawn, with special congratulations for the hero and his side kick more than nice. And most episode plots are palatable. So, what could be wrong? What about the female characters and the cosmetically perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them? <br /> <br /> Producers insist on portraying the female characters in this series, almost good, in a way that makes the final product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader. Why, I ask, why? <br /> <br /> All episodes deflate when the guest star or the recurring character appears on the screen. These actresses are totally incredible in their roles, and you do not really have to see them to know they are unable to perform their functions. A blind person could say it. Just listen to them talk. They deliver their dialogue with all the drama and effect of a 16-year-old at the high school prom. Who would believe that these women are scientific doctors, senators, executives and doctors? <br /> <br /> In short, if the producers have the option of a Stockard Channing or a Morgan Fairchild, guess who they will be choosing - every time? And, of course, the series suffers for it. Too!
