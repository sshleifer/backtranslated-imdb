I'm from Rumania. I will try to speak in english. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my number one of all time. I have seen it over 30 times at least and will see it for many years. It has all the little things that I like about a movie, it's very moving, it makes me cry. It shows a lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality, and the real things that are important to different people. It happens that for me this is the most important thing, the love, the soul of a man, his inner being, and this I see in this movie. Perhaps for me it is much more than an image in movement, it is a test in my mind that could really exist and that you make the most of every moment you live with your soul mate. It is very far from reality to science fiction, but ... what? What would happen if all capitalism disappeared and the economy fell, fell? We would all worry about other problems and my thought is that, on your deathbed, the most important thing you remember is not wealth, nor adventure, nor the countries you visited and the people who remember you. But the true friends and your true love and the hope that after your death, everyone will be damn perfect and the people would be good and they would worry more. LOOK AT THIS MOVIE and it will probably guide you through your life as it did with me :) Hail from Romania
