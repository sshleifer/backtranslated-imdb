['Going for something far from the deliberately crude things he usually does, John Waters (happy birthday, John!) Made this parody of the world of celebrities and art. Edward Furlong plays the main character, a working class teenager in Baltimore who loves to photograph things. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers her work, she offers him his great opportunity, which he accepts. But once you hit it big, you have to reconsider everything. <br /><br /> Basically, &quot;Pecker&quot; analyzes how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity. The kind of thing we could expect, of course, but with the direction of Waters, there are always some things that will surprise us (you&#39;ll meet them when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also starring Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.']
