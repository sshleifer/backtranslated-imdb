Watching this movie again really brought back good memories of childhood. I am 34 years old now, I have not seen it since I was 12-14. I had almost forgotten about this movie, but when I saw it again recently, some scenes literally made me cry! That little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like going back to visit my childhood. It was an absolutely incredible experience for me. I will always appreciate this movie for that reason. I hope some of you readers can relate to my experience, not with this particular movie, but with any movie you have not seen in a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> -Thank you for reading
