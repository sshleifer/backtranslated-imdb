I love the characters and the story. Very fun with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances. I enjoyed the dynamic and comic interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very friendly and surprisingly friendly hit man. The three actors are among my favorites and I have them in this film made for a special gift. A good addition to my extensive DVD collection. I recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, L.A. Confidential, Good Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and, The Whole Nine Yards ... you'll love this movie.
