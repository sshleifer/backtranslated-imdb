Choosing Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was pure brilliance. Cassidy embodied arrogance, confidence, charm and wit, all with a malicious and condescending smile on her face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best killer (having appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This particular performance (and the first) is my favorite episode of Columbo of all time: without a doubt. Steven Spielberg did an amazing camera job (yes, there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors sometimes) capturing the nuances and jokes at different and intriguing angles between Columbo and Franklin. In addition, the panoramic and tight shots in Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's cabin home) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this episode yet, then you owe it to yourself to do so. It is a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was highly contagious. His death in 1976, at 49, was very sad and, in fact, very tragic: he surely had his best years ahead of him. Rest in peace, Jack, you will live eternally through your great work.
