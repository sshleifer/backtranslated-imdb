Paul Reiser did a spectacular job writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It is worthy of an Academy Award. This was one of the most moving and fun films of the year. Reiser's wit is fantastic and is as good as it looks and as it was in his long series of television comedy "Mad about You". Peter Falk did an excellent job like his father, and Peter, who is now 78 years old, made us laugh and cry at the same time. The cast of support was equal to the task, especially the beautiful and beautiful Elizabeth Perkins. It is a film that must be seen for 2005. We bet that everyone, of all ages and religions, will adore this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another. We have mothers and fathers and brothers like these in the movie. We have all had good and bad moments together and we wish things were the same but different.
