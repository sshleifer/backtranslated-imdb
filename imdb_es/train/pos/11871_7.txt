Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture that is not easily forgotten. Al Pacino becomes an impressive performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who becomes a powerful player in the drug world while relentlessly driving his own realm of crime in Florida. This gangster movie is harsh, violent, noisy, disgusting, unpleasant and must keep the record for uttering the word "f - k" as many times. Almost three hours long, and yes, it can be repulsive. A robust-hearted constitution keeps you in your seat by encouraging the demise of a ruthless crime lord. <br /> <br /> There are also interesting characters like Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of their generation. He manages to make his character a reality that leaves a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone, since they will leave thinking that they left a disaster. Is that powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay for long!
