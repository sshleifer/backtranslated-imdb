'An Itch In Time' is one of a series of home runs that Bob Clampett hit for WB in the early 1940s, including 'Horton Hatches The Egg' and 'Tortoise Wins By A Hare'. Soaked in manic time and exaggerated chaos, it is basically the saga of a flea that is busy opening the land for a new home, and the dog whose land is breaking down. Because Master Elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath if he or she scratches, the unfortunate canine is forced to endure an upward spiral of torment, as the landowner's flea uses pickaxes and power tools to clear the land. Ultimately, the little monster lights the wick of a small mountain of high-powered explosives that has been placed on the victim's backside! There is a tremendous explosion, and the unfortunate mutt covers his eyes while his back part erupts in a dazzling display of the Fourth of July! That really has to hurt, and the dog flees, but soon stops the action and says with a happy smile: 'You better interrupt him, because I think he's starting to like me.' For years, this perverse confession was censored, but current impressions have restored the clip, so now viewers can enjoy it in its original diabolic glory. Still cut, however, is the closing gag in which the cat blows his brain after he laments, "Now I've seen it all!" This was a common joke in WB, but since then it has been removed from this caricature and several others, including that of 'Horton'.
