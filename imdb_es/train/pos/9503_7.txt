A bit slow and boring, the story of an old man and his wife living in a desolate building and interacting with a cast of characters like the postman, the brothers sitting on the porch, the rich man smoking cigars. The photography of the river is wonderful, as is the interior decoration. If you like the decoration of Banana Republic stores, this is a must.
