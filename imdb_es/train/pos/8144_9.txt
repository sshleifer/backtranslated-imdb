Having seen "Fear of a Black Hat" and "This is Spinal Tap", I can honestly state that, while they are similar, both films should be seen. There will be many times in "Fear" that will make you hysterical. It's no wonder why both films have so many cult followers. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if necessary, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for you.
