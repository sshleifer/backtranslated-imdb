Now, for all the cinematic improvements that exist, this movie may not be in a high position on your list of things to see. But if you know something about the development of the plot, the profound truth and intentions that this film (the series) had, you would understand my point of view. <br /> <br /> Granted, the details of the film are representations of the writer. , who can not wait to know what will happen at the end. But the film is biblically accurate and justifiably "scares" viewers to think about what it might be. I am a Christian, not because of this movie, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed in it can notably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, but rather, a means to get your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know I will not be left behind and thanks to films like this, I can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment, acting and the budget of the film to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer. This is a movie that you should not only see, but also feel with your heart and soul.
