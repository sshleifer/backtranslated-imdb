Although most Americans have little knowledge of their work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced incredible work, particularly in the 1940s and 1950s, from dramas to outrageous comedies. I particularly love their comedies, since they are very well made and seem so natural and real on the screen, very different from the usual Hollywood rates. <br /> <br /> That said, this was the movie that sparked my interest in these movies. The plot was so strange and cute that it is very unlikely that the film was made anywhere, except at Ealing Studios, which had a special predilection for "small" movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Guinness He is a small nerd scientist who works for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, although he is not working for the company as a researcher but for cleaning work! Therefore, it tends to sneak into laboratories (either during the day if nobody suspects or at night) and tries to invent. Repeatedly, they catch him (like after he blew up the lab) and give him the boot until one day he really succeeds. Then, despite the importance of the discovery, it initiates a chain of completely unforeseen events, and then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is a wonderful satire that mocks the industry, the unions and the government. and the people in general.
