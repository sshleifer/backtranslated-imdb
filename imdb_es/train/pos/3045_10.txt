This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh, a crackling of the country, Arjun Singh, is very funny. The best thing is that laughter never stops. The plot is a story of the same age, where the child separates from the mother who sacrifices everything for her duty, with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are sluts (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather dismissed just in case. But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you remember at the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and her dialogue and her ways are very funny. Later in the film he becomes the angry young man for whom he is famous, but the humor remains. Memorable parts include his walking, speaking and speaking in English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his diceo. <br /> <br /> In general, I laughed with laughter throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at its best, here it is. It will easily give you a 10/10.
