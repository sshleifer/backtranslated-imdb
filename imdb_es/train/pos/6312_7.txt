Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," they starred in this film. George Clooney also participated in this film as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. In potential, this also seems to be a fine and entertaining project, which is in line with the remakes of films like "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this movie only succeeds by half, or at least it is not. as good as it could have been. <br /> <br /> The film in which all its characters are being played by some well-known actors, but it is a pity that the characters do not have enough space to develop. Although in their potential they could have turned into funny and pleasant characters, now they are only characters that are entertained slightly due to most of the most extravagant sequences of the film. The fact that they are playing does not change much to this, although they prevent their characters from becoming a total boredom or even something annoying, or something like that. <br /> <br /> It is, of course, because of the writing that the characters are not used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than this movie. The film is based too much on its simple story and its predictable way of telling stories. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is simply very funny to watch maybe because of that same simplicity. It's a harmless Caper movie, in which you simply should not worry too much about the story. In that sense, "Welcome to Collinwood" is a film that works and that fulfills its function. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you will not regret seeing it once you've finished it, but it is too. a movie that you can easily do without ever seeing it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
