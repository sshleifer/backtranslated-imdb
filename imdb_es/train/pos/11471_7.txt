I'm a big movie fan and I saw this movie because I heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say that it was very interesting. The two main actors are amazing, the film is never boring and the concept behind it (although obviously inspired by the murders of Columbine and the home movies of the murderers) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes that really detract from the realism observed in the first hour and the end really does not make any sense. The unstable camera can sometimes be a distraction, but in the cinema, that's a fact. But I still think that the film is very well made and director Ben Coccio deserves some credit.
