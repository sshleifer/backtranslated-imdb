This is a sublime piece of filmmaking. Flow at the right pace at all times. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. The comic parts are hilarious and even more so because of the depressing and tragic nature of the film. <br /> <br /> However, despite the many comments about the inherent tragedy of the story, it was all the less depressing for me. I enjoyed it a lot in a way that I have not experienced for a long time. That is to say, it is excellent and, however, without all the common pitfalls of modern movies like; Sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> 'Dan In Real Life' does not lack anything to be without regular vices. It has a completely mature plot that simply does not require, and in fact would be ruined by any additional adornment. At the same time, the subject is totally adult. It is a work of art in itself that encapsulates it completely and you do not want anything more than what it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that feel a bit 'Waltons' but actually make sense. In the long run, since they contrast the most dysfunctional moments. The rosier gives way to the tragic that is then given to the idyllic that becomes the darkest, etc. This undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of stability similar to lithium. The peaks and valleys are gentle but more than adequate for the pleasure they inculcate. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie, regardless of the genre you normally enjoy. Put aside any prejudice because this is a must see!
