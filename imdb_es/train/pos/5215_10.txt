All I can say is, the first movie of this season that caught my attention. I chose it for the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story seemed promising. I just saw her and I can say that I am overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, right ... but that is what makes it more realistic. We must not run away from our reality, these things are happening at this moment. And there are experts who are trying to change things and improve them and who laugh at their commitment to the cause. In fact, it seems I can not feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie ... and that's what makes it better. Both Claire and Richard did a great job, and they deserve a 10 from me.
