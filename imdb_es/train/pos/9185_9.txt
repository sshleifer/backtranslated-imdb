DOUBLE EXHIBITION was a tremendous surprise. It contains an outstanding performance (particularly Callan underestimated), a good picture and a compelling story. In other words, it is one of the best horror efforts that emerged in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models, at a time when he meets with his psychologically unstable brother. (who lacks an arm and a leg). When the models that Callan dreams of killing really die, the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity ... but there is more to the image of what he sees. <br /> <br /> This movie never received praise. It deserves The majority of the critics and spectators of the cinema group it with the horde of slasher films thrown at the same time, but it is very over the thickness of that lamentable lot. It is intelligent and unique, which is not something that one can comfortably say about most movies of this genre, but it is also done and made with passion. DOUBLE EXHIBITION is a jewel of its kind.
