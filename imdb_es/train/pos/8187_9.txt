Does anyone find it interesting that the Ood look strangely similar to the 'Great Cthulhu' of the Harvest H P Lovecraft? hmmm? <br /> <br /> A great couple of episodes (it does not refer to Billie Piper as it seems they do it more!) in The Impossible Planet and The Pit of Satan. <br /> <br /> Also the link to 'Legion' I think also used in Who before and also referring to Satan in several post-exorcist novels ... <br /> <br /> Great episodes of suspense that use elements of fear and faith. The new team for these 'who are working with great magic for television. <br /> <br /> This certainly creates new fears and feelings of 'hiding behind the couch' that have not been seen for many, many years in this continuation of an excellent BBC series. (Too bad that the BBC has confirmed that Billie Piper is resigning, perhaps not permanently, after the end of series 2): O (((
