The Ramones, whom I consider the founders of modern punk rock, lend their unique sounds to a wildly twisted movie about a noisy rock fan (PJ Soles) who confronts a ruthless and joyless director (Mary Woronov) for the right to rock. <br /> <br /> With a soundtrack full of incredible music, RRHS is fascinating in concept and execution. It is full of jokes in sight (like the mouse experiment), teenage spirit (probably my first favorite movie premiere) and strange moments outside the wall (the scenes of the straitjacket). If you are looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun at the molecular level, look no further. But if you are looking for a beautiful, dignified and dramatic epic, maybe you should look a little further. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, I'm Riff Randell, and this is Rock & Roll High School!"
