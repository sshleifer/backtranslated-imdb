An ultramodern house in a prosperous neighborhood seems to be the cause of each of its inhabitants, strange (and deadly) behavior. Or at least that's what the character of Lara Flynn Boyle, Col Kennedy, argues. After a series of deadly events in a giant house next door, Col knows something has to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also plays the mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: The House Next Door works thanks to Lara Flynn Boyle and the places (beautiful house) and the elegant sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention quite impressive. She gives credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing. Without it, I would have failed. "He's so alive," declares a potential buyer in reference to the house. Yes, he is alive. But the story itself is not so much. <br /> <br /> By preventing the presence of Boyle, here is not much, as a lot of movies are spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. Cinematography gives the film a polished look. 8/10 by Boyle, the premise of an ultramodern evil house, places and cinematography, and decor and costumes.
