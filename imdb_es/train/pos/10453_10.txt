While traveling by train in Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States of America and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite romances, in fact one of the most beautiful love stories I've seen in my life. It's a low budget movie with a very simple and real story, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogues are impressive. The direction is incredible, transmitting the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I just completed my 1,000th revision in IMDb, and I chose "Before Sunrise" for this significant number because it is a very special movie for me. I can not understand why this movie was not nominated for an Oscar, with a great script, direction and performances. Yesterday I've probably seen this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
