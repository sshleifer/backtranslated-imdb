You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it is asleep ... I can explain it, I think! Well ... Until that happened on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have freedom of expression, but when we obtained it in the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese lost their opinion, we do not use our Freedom of expression! That is all consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear! ... About the movie ... I think it has some errors in the performance of some characters, but because of the way I use to watch movies in Portuguese, it's pretty good! I like very much!
