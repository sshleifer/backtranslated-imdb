Greetings again from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 apparently unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights. A very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust as a spectator. We are so accustomed to character development in a 2-hour movie, it is a bit disarming to happen in an 8-minute segment. <br /> <br /> The idea is 18 love / relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods of this Magnificent city. Of course, some rise better than others and others opt for comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotion. Some well-known directors are involved, among them: the Coen brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many well-known faces also make appearances: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments involves a mime, and then another mime and the nerdy son, but happy of the two mimes. Red coat, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child and many other issues also play a key role. Do not miss Alexander Payne (director of "Sideways") as Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the segments makes it interesting to watch, but as a movie, it can not be described as excellent. It is still very visible and a good change of pace for the movie aficionado.
