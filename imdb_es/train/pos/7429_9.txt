She is such an extraordinary singer, who cares about anything else !!!! That final scene is one of the best moments of the entire biz show - without exception! I'm glad he kept the camera on himself for ten minutes, he deserves that iconic state, such is the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was when I was five years old and it had a big impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I can see some of the flaws (like Esther, who wants to leave the Grammy's right when her prize is announced). <br /> <br /> But some of the comments from other users are simple fake - I mean, where's the free nudity - maybe we saw different movies? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing ability is monumental, and if she has a big ego, well! <br /> <br /> She has earned it.
