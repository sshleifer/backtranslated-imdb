Some people loved "the aristocrats" and others hated it, often going out in the middle. The reactions to Eddie Izzard are probably not so extreme, if he can handle a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that makes, say, enough use of the word "f" that his program would be a beep long if it is presented on the television network. Many of Izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws in their performances. On the other hand, I thought that this show was occasionally flatter than Izzard's chest, but also very often that it was funny and, in some places, absolutely hilarious. You have a way to connect the references of the routines at the beginning of the program to your later routines. He is not a storyteller. He is not a joker. He is not a frantic ghost like Robin Williams. Play with ideas, some of which work and others: a routine with the cable car of San Francisco and Alcatraz, for example, are completely extravagant. However, he has a way to move gracefully beyond the failed routines and extend the ones that connect. I gave this performance a 7 and could be persuaded to raise it to an 8. But to a 10? No way.
