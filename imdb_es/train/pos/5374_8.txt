William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buy an old house where years ago there was a brutal murder in very bad conditions with the intention of restoring it. They move in with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and become friends with their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, spooky events occur in the house, including the death of Sophie's cat. At Sophie's birthday party, a pipe drips blood and they leave the place, revealing a secret later. <br /> <br /> "The house that bled to death" is a fear and one of the best episodes of the series "Hammer House of horror". The fantastic turn, the revelation of a secret and the tragic conclusion are really excellent. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer" ("The house that bled to death")
