I keep watching this movie over and over again. I have to see it at least once a week. I'm from Africa and seeing that movie taught me some things I did not even know about Africa. Denzel's films are full of lessons for people of life. I wish I was my own brother. I have also seen and love your Masala Mississipi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to hook up his brother at work, he reminds me of my teenage years when my brother was always mad at me for occupying me all the time. My brother was always taking care of my old father and he wants to see me the same way too. By the way, where did Denzel get that African accent in the movie Cry Freedom? The first time I saw that movie in Africa, I did not know Denzel was an American until I moved here.
