I've lost count of how many criticisms I've written on Slaughter High. I have read many of the bad ones and I will say now that this is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore became famous in a short time for his famous suicide, and although this was his only film, it is what made the film so great. At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide. Then I found out because of the current website at www.IMDb.com. He was born in 1957, in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life certainly had its strengths and weaknesses. He did a good acting job, who can disagree? I always wondered how he felt naked in a movie. It must have been quite embarrassing to say the least. The first time I saw this movie was when I was 12 years old in the sixth grade. I agree with some indicators that the girl would not take a bath after someone murdered, and that high schools DO NOT have bathtubs! I think Caroline Munro, who was 36 years old at the time, was the only other star who had a talent for acting worthy, and unfortunately for the death of Simon did not make future films. The reason (s) for his suicide is a mystery, and it is to be expected that it will be discovered in the near future. Doing the calculations on his website, he tells him that he was 29 years old when he did Slaughter High. He seemed like a teenager. I give this movie two thumbs up, the best horror movie made. Probably due to his horrible performance, the others did not become famous in the film business. -Jacob Young
