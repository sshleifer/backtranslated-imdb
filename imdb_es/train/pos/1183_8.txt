A man readjusts to life only after 45 years of marriage. She also has to solve the problem of the family's dairy cow, Tulip√°n, which refuses to allow herself to be milked. Until, that is, visualize his wife who used to milk Tulip. <br /> <br /> Tulip is based on a true story told in the family of Griffith, of the generation of his grandparents. The film is a nostalgic look at a disappearing lifestyle, one in which people still feel some mutual responsibility, set in the lush green Victorian landscape (the Australian state, not the era). <br /> <br /> Writer and director Griffiths evidently has additional ambitions in both areas, and this award-winning 15-minute short is a good start to his roll.
