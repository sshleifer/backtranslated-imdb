This is my first CG animation movie I've seen. In general, the appearance of other animated films made me reluctant to see them. It is not the ice age. I wanted to see it the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat, the funny saber-tooth squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice Age was a sporadically fun and generally entertaining movie to watch. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, with 20,000 years old. The images were great. Simply beautiful. One thing is to create convincing information, another thing is to create visually attractive things and Ice Age is great to see with your stylized images. Blue Sky Studios is a company to consider in the future.
