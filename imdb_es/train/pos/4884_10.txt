['For people of a certain age, World War II was the time that defined their lives, and what happened could never be compared. As the film begins, a woman recently widowed but still animated (Judi Dench) hears a street musician trying to play the classic song &quot;Stardust&quot;. <br /><br /> This recalls his memories of when he played in an almost female band that entertained amid bombing during the War. The drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm), happily avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies. <br /><br /> The character of Patrick and Dench meet and decide to reunite the band, which leads them to a series of mini adventures. Despite the ups and downs, the band meets and reappears successfully. <br /><br /> The film is exquisitely written and discreet, with excellent performances by everyone involved. The characters are well developed and all the people who have not stopped living, despite their years. And there&#39;s all that old and glorious swing music! <br /><br /> This is not the pontification of Steven Spielberg, but it is a serious film. The war affected everyone and that lesson is not forgotten in a film that is not afraid to entertain as it teaches.']
