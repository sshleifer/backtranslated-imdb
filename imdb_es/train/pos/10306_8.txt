As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this film got points with me even before I saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some small parts with people from Buffalo's real-life news television ... and, for once, they do not touch the area. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Theology, puh-leeze! God is still made to look and think like humans ... and, of course, be a bit of the liberal side. Being the light comedy that it is, it's nothing to win any prize, but it's still entertaining and it's a nice way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some funny scenes of laughter out loud and, hopefully, audiences - from Christians to atheists - we got something out of this besides some laughter, like what prayer really should be. Congratulations to the writers for having managed to at least correct that theology and give a good message. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good-hearted movie that should offend very few.
