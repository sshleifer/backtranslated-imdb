Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon) who was banished from his kingdom because his father (the king) was killed by the clich√© "evil counselor". This movie is about Simon's adventures. The special effects, the plot, the acting and, in general, everything related to this movie is BAD. However, it is so bad that it is fun. You will continue to watch this movie simply because it is so bad that it is fun and, as the other critic of the movie said, it is so bad that it is good.
