['Like &quot;My Sassy Girl,&quot; this film is based on a true story published on the Internet, but that&#39;s where the similarities end. The story is usually about this rebellious boy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a tutor named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from an environment poor, but happens to be the same age as him. Add to that some obstacles, the martial arts (the thugs always chase Ji-Hoon for revenge), a child of ill and despised love who persecutes him, his tendency to abandon the lessons, and can usually guess the whole story. Did I mention it&#39;s a romantic comedy? This film has good fighting scenes, great visual humor and lots of energy, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, who bring a lot of energy to the story. Romantic elements also work for that reason. And, I must say, I would like a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than that &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot; girl (at least in terms of personality). She has a little sperm, but it&#39;s more of the cute, sweet, kind-hearted way. Most of the characters are nice (so you could say I had less to upload than &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot;, an obstacle that worked for that movie), and the movie is pretty smart and interesting most of the way. . However, the type of story sinks, approximately two-thirds of the way (which is based on a standard family rate, where nothing really interesting happens), but almost at the end, it recovers a little bit again. In general, a fun, beautiful movie. 8/10']
