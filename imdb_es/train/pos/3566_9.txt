In 1954, Marlon Brando was THE hot actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had not yet reinvented himself on the silver screen. But the representation of Sinatra as the old Nathan Detroit, helped to restore Sinatra with his fans. <br /> <br /> It's a great on-screen version of a great play and the options of potential customers and support are excellent. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? This was his only role as a singer when he played Sky Masterson. In addition, the female leaders, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (repeating their role on stage as the long-suffering girlfriend of Nathan, Adelade), put all their efforts. A special mention is for the great Stubby Kaye (and very well), and with due respect to Eric Clapton, the Rockin 'The Boat version of anyone comes close to Stubby's. Sheldon Leonard, who would go on to fame as a television producer of shows like The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show does wonders in "Harry The Horse", BSPulley is excellent, as he is very coarse and resentful of "Big Julie" . and even Regis Toomey offers his excellence as "Brother Arvide". <br /> <br /> It's one of the fun musicals to watch, good comedy, and you have Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" and brother ... "are your dice"
