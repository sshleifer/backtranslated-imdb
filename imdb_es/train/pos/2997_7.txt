William Powell is Philo Vance in "The Kennel Murder Case", a 1933 film also starring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show in which Philo has entered his Scottish terrier Captain serves as background for a mystery of closed room with too many suspects. The mystery is very intelligent and the outcome is complicated and interesting. Since the conversation fans are still quite young, the camera work is a little static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job directing the action. <br /> <br /> The cast of support is excellent; The whole cast takes the film to a higher level. Many actors have played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell was the one who played the most (five times) and is the best fit for the role: very relaxed but serious at the same time. This was done before "The Thin Man" catapulted him to big stardom. He had spent about 12 years in the film by then, beginning his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man, a remarkable presence on the screen and a remarkable actor who lived almost 92 years. We are so lucky to have your movies available on DVD and on TCM today. "The Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and a funny movie, do not miss it.
