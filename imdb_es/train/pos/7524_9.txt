For a film ostensibly about sex and leather, it has no right to be as sweet as it is. The story of Bettie Page, a good Christian girl from the south that Mom would not let her out until she got married, moved to New York and became the most successful person of her age, is due to an outstanding performance by Gretchen Moll. Her page can not reconcile the images she takes (nobody can touch them, it's fun and respectful) with the pornography essays and the supposed negative effects that her images have on the world around her. <br /> <br /> Page has been an inspiration to all burlesque artists ever since, not only because he had a figure to die for, but because he invested each image with a sense of innocent fun that was exceptionally sexy and simple Same time. More like this movie, in fact. Filmde in technicolor black and white and glorious, is a lovely way to spend a couple of hours.
