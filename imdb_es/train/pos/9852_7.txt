Not a day goes by without a new computer-animated movie, so now we have possibilities to see more than some nice effects. After watching Ice Age, I felt that it was not as big an impact on me as on other films of this genre. <br /> <br /> But it's because I'm now a Big Guy, and I'm pretty sure this is a very nice Movie for the kids (maybe up to 14). The story is quite simple, and the "actors" are fun in a nice way, without any crude or complex humor. Even the "evil one" is adorable, a big, fluffy cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a small disappointment to me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way), but it's a great thing for children. And, apart from some fights, nobody dies (not even when it is trampled by a mammoth, several times), which created a caricature sensation. <br /> <br /> The computer animation part is nice but nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoon scenes, when you feel like walking in a nice painting or in the pages of a comic. [Which means a lot of work, though!] <br /> <br /> There were some gags that made me smile. I accept, the creators tried to satisfy those adults, but they are difficult to detect and (in my opinion) are better. He let go unnoticed, as it does not seem to fit into the story. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good movie, but it is rather in the cliche of Disney ideal for animals and children for children. If you do not hate cute animals doing funny things, look at them at least once.
