I just saw Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be. The performance of Toby Malone really stood out, I really worried about what happened to Matt throughout the whole movie, which in turn is very fun, very peaceful, with a good combination of well-rounded characters, a whole achievement, considering it is a short race hour. There are also a lot of good turns, it will keep you guessing until the end. Other characters to consider are the totally crazy Tiny and the attractive and clever Jesse. You may not have the big budget of a blockbuster Hollywood, but do not let that discourage you, you could do much worse than check it, you will not regret it. Good fun. 7/10
