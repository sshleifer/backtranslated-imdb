I remember that I liked this more than Nausicaa from the valley of the winds at a time when that tone of history was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected its launch in the US UU To avoid confusion in his broad Hispanic audiences, he has the caricature of the director's debut production, Conan. In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan, who jumped out of a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running. This makes him the most animated and enjoyable character to watch. Nausica technology fans may be disappointed by flying insects and retro technology in Laputa; the only exception may be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and the Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly related to environmentalism. If it has a theme at all it is against war. The importance of living in a natural way: this is related to the flying castle, it is discussed in a despicable way and it is not fulfilled. In general, I now consider that the piece is at an intersection between feeling good and cheesy.
