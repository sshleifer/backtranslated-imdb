I must admit that I did not expect much to see this movie in my Japenese film class, but this movie really impressed me. The director does a wonderful job following the title of his film, truly portraying an image of madness. I think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness, helping the viewer to experience the inner world of the characters instead of the world outside their mind. This film adds to my feelings about foreign silent films against American ones, in the sense that foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think instead of opting for the fluffy film always with the happy ending, exercising very little imagination.
