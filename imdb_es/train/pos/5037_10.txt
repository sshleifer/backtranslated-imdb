This could be the most underestimated film of its kind. I do not remember seeing any ad or ad for this, which may be why it did not work so well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and truly original horror movie. I rank it among the top 10 favorite horror films on my list. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with snapshots of photos and news articles that tell us about an assassin who calls himself "the hand of God." And then a man enters a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to a place where the victims are buried, which could help solve the case. During that trip, the man begins to tell the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father who, one day, affirms that he has received a divine message from God that asks him to kill the demons that appear to be normal human beings. He receives from God a list of the names of the demons that must be destroyed and asks his children to help him carry out this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely horrible and suspenseful movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Tension is high, innocent people (or demons?) Die and religious experiences are questioned. It does not have one but a few very smart turns at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. I own the DVD and it is one of my best horror thrillers of all time.
