Skippy of Family Ties goes from being a pretty corny girl to the metal guys. The film seems to have been made in response to all those annoying parents who said that metal music was making their children evil or making them commit suicide, except that in this case a dead Satanic metal star is trying to return from the grave (using to Skippy to help). And while the plot is corny and clich√©, the brushstroke (for example, an evil green haze that takes off a girl's clothes) and the soundtrack are what make the movie so fun (and great). And, of course, there's nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who asks what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie to invite some friends to laugh. And while it does, turn it into a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2: there is an "evil assassin" (as indicated in the video box), killer of black leather drillers with fringes. A must see for cheesy movie lovers.
