It's a fairly simple movie, not very active but very charming. There were times when I can see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close did not win at Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe winner, and Cher, BAFTA nominee, plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low-paying job whom Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) just asked him to Marry him He promises to return in a month, since his mother is sick, so she means that, meanwhile, he needs most of his family to attend the wedding. The only problem is that when she finds Johnny's hands-free brother, Ronny (Golden Globe nominee Nicolas Cage), they begin to have a relationship, and love continues in that lunar scene (where the title comes from). Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends without a wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. He won the Oscar for Best Writing, Written Script Directly for the Screen, and was nominated for Best Director by Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture, was nominated for the BAFTA for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay , and was nominated for the Golden Globes for Best Film, Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 in 100 years, 100 appointments ("Get out of this!"), It was number 17 in 100 years, 100 passions, and it was number 41 in 100 years, 100 laughs. Very well!
