Yes, some plots are a bit difficult to follow, and The Bill has a tendency to be violent, but it's actually a fascinating show, which I try not to miss. The vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is pretty good, although I miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I must admit that I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it's a shame that the program is now after the basin, since I found it easier to see when it was at 8.00. Still, the reason why I like The Bill is because not only is it absorbing, but the Cliffhangers at the end make the next episode unforgettable. However, it is true that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
