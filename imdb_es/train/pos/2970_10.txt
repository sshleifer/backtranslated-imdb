['I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I&#39;ve seen! The witty humor made me laugh all the time, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so exaggerated, reinforces the comedy of the movie. <br /><br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD and it&#39;s just one of those movies where you never get tired of watching it. I have a very short attention span and I think this movie has some funny snippets that keeps me entertained. The humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if I remember them later. <br /><br /> So, overall, I think Baseketball is a brilliant movie that everyone should see, especially if you&#39;re younger than me, as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards. <br /><br /> PD: Does anyone think it&#39;s strange that I like both? hehe']
