Although it is not as wild or as far as some of Takashi Miike's later films, this is a very good criminal drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of a Japanese police officer with Chinese parents trying to take down a Chinese mobster. To complicate matters, his younger brother is acting as the villain's lawyer and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than that, with several complications that keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative impulse. It is this complication and the loss of an hour in the film that makes it less than a great movie. (It's a very good one) It's worth seeing, especially if you do not mind a frantic pace. <Br /> <br /> A warning, violence when it occurs is explosive and unpleasant. There are also semi-graphic representations of gay sex. If that is not your cup of tea, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 of 10.
