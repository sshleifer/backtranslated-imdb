This crime thriller is something of a black cinema, although it changes the post-war context to the Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street", the cops are good guys, the criminals are real, and the only enemies are "The Commies", who ultimately differ from the good ones in that they are emotionally pleasant, driven by a care real of its own value, as shown in the constant close-ups followed that stain the film. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around the characters. The personalities of this film are quite singular and detailed: it ignores the booty that can look at any danger and, sometimes, go through their personal possessions; Moe, the informant who is trying to save up for a spectacular funeral, but manages to capture the hearts and respect of almost all the other characters (and the audience); Candy, the innocent and misnamed girl who only thinks she is doing government work and does not fully understand the conspiracy with which she is involved; and Joey, Commie's evil former boyfriend who tries to hide everything from everyone and, ironically, is the worst person who does it. Add lots of colorful support characters (like the guy with the chopsticks and the cops) and "Pickup on South Street" takes you to a splendor of personalities while hunting the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames. <Br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
