['This film has everything that makes it worthwhile to see a bad movie: sloppy editing, little or no continuity, insane dialogue, bad (you could even say it does not exist), meaningless story lines, shots that last for too long ... and it&#39;s perfect for MST3K-style riffing, not to mention the &quot;Carcass Eaters Drinking Game&quot;: Scribble on shapes ... take a picture - Sign your name ... take a picture - Catch a bad edition of Foley ... take many, many shots <br /><br /> The only reason I did not rate it above 8 is because there is not enough free nudity and because despite its madness, it only lasts one hour. Hell, a movie like this should have been at least 20-30 minutes longer!']
