SERIES 1 <br /> <br /> While the UK is eagerly awaiting the release of series two of 'Lost', series one (which has just been shown here) did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> A group of more than forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crashes on a desert island. They pray for the ransom. However, as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the tropical jungle that surrounds them, they begin to wonder if they are alone. <br /> <br /> It is true that the series has difficulty keeping up with the explosive Pilot Episodes, which throw the group a polar bear, a giant beast and the possibility of others on the island. However, the series manages to recover after a few episodes and is highlighted by the final episode. Possibly the best thing about "Lost" is the fact that we visited the life of each character before the crash in a series of flashbacks. This gives us more information and, therefore, more suspense and emotion as the events unfold in the present. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this show is an excellent combination of drama, suspense and the supernatural; it is simply unmissable. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR THE SEASON 1 FOLLOW <br /> <br /> SERIES 2 <br /> <br /> After the cliffhanger that was the end of the Series 1 of 'Lost', the Series 2 begins with our protagonists who delve into the heart of the phenomenon that is the Hatch. They discover a mysterious man who has a job to do. Meanwhile, Michael and Sawyer struggle to deal with the consequences of what happened on the raft. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, viewers will not be able to turn off their television, as each episode of The series contains more twists than a Curly-Wurly chocolate bar, one of which features a large number of new characters. With each mystery solved with 'Lost', five new ones seem to come out of the carpentry. After the 974 turn of the plot of the series, it finally occurs to the viewer that it really does not matter if the survivors of the plane crash manage to leave the island. However, the impressive end of the series responds to just over half of those questions, despite its anti-climatic end.
