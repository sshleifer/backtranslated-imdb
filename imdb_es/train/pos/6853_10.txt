Dressed to Kill (1980) is a mysterious horror movie by Brian De Palma and it really works. The environment is right there. The environment that scares you And that's not what a horror movie is supposed to do. All the actors are in the right places. Michael Caine is perfect as Dr. Robert Elliott, shrinking with a little secret. Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, the sexually frustrated mature woman is great. Keith Gordon as his son Peter is brilliant. Nancy Allen as Liz Blake, the prostitute, is fantastic. Dennis Franz plays his typical detective role. His detective Marino is one of the most colorful of this movie. There are many spooky scenes in this movie. The elevator scene is one of them. Comparisons between this and Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. Both of these movies can cause some sleepless nights.
