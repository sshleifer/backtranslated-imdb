I read the negative comments before watching this movie and without flinching, I went ahead and started watching. I admit that I had to rewind several times since the movie is incredibly complex, involved and full of details. That's a good thing, but also, quite unexpected in this culture of car chases, explosions, free sex and general violence that replace the development of the plot and character. In fact, what a welcome departure, however, I am so used to not paying much attention to what I see. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of character development and plot; the kind we used to analyze when I was in high school. It requires real mental participation on the part of the viewer. What a beautiful change I would compare it to 'All the president's men' in terms of generic stuff. That is, it is a mystery about the lack of intense behavior on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence over officials to essentially "own them." <br /> <br /> Unlike 'All the President's Men', this film makes an effort to give some of the characters a real personality. In this sense, the film is a study of characters like 'The Negotiatior' with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In that film, his characters are employees of the city and the plot is extremely intense. However, the plot depends on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other, trust each other and, ultimately, unite against the corrupt Police Department. There are more shots in this movie and the specific plot is different, but generically, there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I will say that the City Council requires much more concentration. In fact, I was surprised by the parallelism with the past and present political scandals that I have seen in my life when I returned to Watergate. The thing is that the public knows that something is wrong, sure! But following the details is hard to do. This movie is not even close to being as complex as real life, but it is actually realistic in its complexity. I think that's one of the reasons why previous posters have criticized the film: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If one sees this knowing what they are about to see and lives up to the experience, it is really excellent! I saw it 3 times in a row! The performance is excellent and the direction is impeccable. The weakest link is the John Cusak accent.
