De Grot is a very good movie. The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé, who also adapted this story for the screen. Some really first class performances, not only by Van Huêt, but especially by Marcel Hensema, who worked mainly in television before his performance of Axel van de Graaf. The movie seems to be a thriller and creates an excellent mood. Then we began to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed little by little in a very convincing flash-back structure, which adds to the more romantic aspect and the drama of the film directed by the characters. In the end, all this culminates in an emotional ending, which will catch audiences with their throats. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you go to see this movie. A must see, especially if you liked 'Spoorloos' (the original screen adaptation of The Vanishing).
