Fox's epic narrative about one of the greatest pioneering efforts in the United States comes to the DVD with some really outstanding "Extras". BRIGHAM YOUNG (the "Frontiersman" was added for the launch in Europe), telling the story of the great pioneer leader, who under inspiration led members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to the Valley of the Lake Salado in 1847, after the mobs murdered his prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as the United States was about to enter World War II. It was a bold move for Fox's boss, Darryl F. Zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air for the Mormon people, as this was the film's first attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen. Now Fox, in collaboration with James D'Arc, curator of the excellent moving image archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has taken this film to the DVD format in an outstanding edition. Mr. D'Arc, who some years ago did his doctoral thesis on the film, has provided one of the deepest commentary tracks that have been made for a DVD. He separates fact from fiction and allows listeners to understand why church leaders appreciate this movie so much, even though the trinkets to the truth are present throughout the film. One of the funniest parts of the information is with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the lead role. Many years after the movie, he married a Latter-day Saint woman and eventually converted to the LDS faith. There is a lot to learn from the knowledge of D'Arc and it is great to have this as part of the DVD! There are more than 100 photos of the Fox and BYU Archives included in the disc, as well as news images of the incredible premiere at seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks to FOX for another outstanding DVD, and thanks to James D'Arc for your excellent commentary.
