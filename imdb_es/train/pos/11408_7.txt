Etienne Girardot is just a character actor, the kind of person people would almost never know by name. However, he once again plays the coroner, one of the few actors in Philo Vance's films who played his role more than once. I've seen it twice before and I've always loved it because it was so fun and it breathed fresh air. This movie is also great to see because, in addition to Girardot, there are many other actors of wonderful characters along the journey, including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is a pretty impressive cast, and they sure made the job easier for the leader Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great actors are one of the big reasons why I love these old B movies. While the mystery itself is rarely so fantastic, due to the windy writing and acting, the movies really do satisfy. As for this movie, Vance is beautifully played by Lowe, but, as I said, the mystery itself is just a later thought, with an absurd plot that involves hypnosis and suicides. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize anyone to do something like that: I have clinical hypnosis training and if I COULD do something like the evil one could do in the movie, I would have done it! Used car dealers and some of my former bosses would have been obvious targets! <br /> <br /> In general, although it is not Philo Vance's best film, it was very good and it is a pity that Lowe has only played this role once. In fact, apart from William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series was hampered by a long and long succession of actors like Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) playing Vance. This is a similar problem that also affected the Bulldog Drummond series: too many different actors playing the protagonist. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing and it is exciting, although it is also quite impossible.
