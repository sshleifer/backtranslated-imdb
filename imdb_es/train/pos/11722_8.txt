To be honest, I watched this movie just because of my puberty needs. I mean, I could not get women at my age (I was 9 or 10 years old), so I thought that seeing Elvira's neckline was the closest thing to sex. <br /> <br /> I ended up having a great time with this cult. classic about the horror comedy, Halloween parties, cheeky humor and some sexy evil shown by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They just do not make movies like this anymore ... I had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a cable TV show late at night. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it generated many fans because of her humor and Cassandra's ability. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that reminds me of the good morning of USA Up All Night.
