During 1933, this film had many cuts because it was very exaggerated by the content of the story and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do anything to obtain great wealth and power. Lily's father had forced his daughter to prostitute herself at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel factory in a city with very poor people and her father published a talk that brought home all kinds of male characters who had his eyes on Lily. . As the story progresses, Lily meets man after man and finally finds a guy who has everything and is the president of a playboy bank. It's great to see a very young John Wayne, (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to first base with Lily, not even for lunch. A very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) stars with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave excellent performances. This is a great film from 1933 that was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and that was locked in a fault for many years and is recently showing on the silver screen. This movie is pretty smooth compared to what we see today on Hollywood screens, but in 1933 it was very bad to watch this kind of movie. Enjoy
