So we got engaged. This was a very charming movie, I liked the artistic direction (it felt much more "real" than most children's movies), and the costumes were not too tender. Child actors were not bad to watch (adult performances tended to be cheesy). It was great that they demonstrated how a bullied child harasses others, as well as others who face bullying. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many adults would want to see this for themselves, but it's a great idea. movie to take a child to. And since apparently more than 100 children attended "Barnyard" at the same time, I am very happy to have chosen the sample of "worms" with little assistance.
