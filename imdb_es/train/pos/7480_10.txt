['This movie is one of the best Tom Cruise movies. Capture the imagination of the audience with his role as David Aames. Your character can relate to all of us in some way. The story line is very intelligent and keeps the audience to the limit throughout the film. I had never seen Cruise movies before, but after seeing this, he shows me his true talent. My favorite part in the movie is the ending, where everything comes to a great conclusion and he discovers the truth. If you have not seen it yet, you should definitely try it. It&#39;s one of those movies that once you start watching it, you just have to see it to the end or it will keep you thinking and you&#39;ll regret it. My opinion is that you should go buy it and take a risk, that&#39;s what I did and it became one of my favorite movies of all time. It&#39;s A * 10/10 I promise that once you see it, it will stay with you and you will like it forever.']
