In response to the person who made the comment about how the film is prolonged and who believed that the role of Jess's brother had no purpose, here is my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of Jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have anticipated the problems associated with living life to the fullest by seeing how Jess's brother turned out. There are several cases in which Brad Pitt and their lives run in parallel, for example, when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to an uncomfortable bar and subsequently finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there, so the character of Craig Sheffer would have a greater emotional turmoil at the death of his brothers, knowing that he could have done more to avoid it and subsequently create a more convincing mood in the film.
