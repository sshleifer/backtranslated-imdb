['Lapyuta (Castle in Heaven), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s films, brings the joy of telling stories to the audience. It&#39;s the kind of movie that makes you feel like a kid again; it&#39;s just magical It&#39;s a crime that took so long to be launched in the United States, but now that it&#39;s here, take a look! And stay with the original language; The dub changed my impressions of the characters a bit, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in the translation of a movie (or book, whatever). <br /><br /> I give it a ten / ten.']
