First of all I am a straight white male, butch. But even with that disadvantage I love this movie. It's about real people. A real time and place. And of course the city of New York in the 80s. I had many gay friends when I grew up in New York in the eighties and the only thing I always admired about them was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them. It does not matter what the consequences are. That is brave. You have to admire that. This is a great movie, watch it and discover what it was like to be an African-American or Hispanic gay man in the New York of the eighties. It's real life In a nutshell it's real life.
