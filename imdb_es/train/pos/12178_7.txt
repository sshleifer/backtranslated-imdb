['I think this movie got a low rating because it was judged by its worst moments. There is a joke of diarrhea and a shameful scene of scratching the nut, but apart from that, there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee is doing a wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to be quite a lot of fun. Besides that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes, you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, better movies to watch, but it&#39;s definitely not the worst choice ... Greetings']
