I found this very moving as Spike and Heaton are kept together throughout this movie, not to say there are not some betrayals on the way. I thought that the persecution had been put aside, I think the relationship between the two was in the foreground. He had already guessed that there were homosexual intentions on Heaton's part. My favorite scene had to be the part where Heaton and Spike were stuck in the swamp and Spike ran. In general I thought that Spike would not return. I must say that if it were not for our film studies teacher who made us see this, I probably would never have seen it. In general, I thought that this movie was quite good and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of British-made movies.
