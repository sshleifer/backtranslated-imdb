This film is pure Elvira and shows it on her chest ... I mean better! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating, and comes alive thanks to Elvira's wit and charm. The viewer has the opportunity to see Elvira from a new perspective while struggling against the prejudices of the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she has traveled from Los Angeles to attend the reading of her will by Aunt Morganna) and at the same time Time, try to help the suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal Chastity Pariah and the rest of the municipal council. He also has to deal with his attraction to Bob Redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (Patty) who is also interested in Bob, but who is not as deserving of his love as Elvira. And, later in the film, she also faces the complications of being a descendant of "one of the leading metaphysical celebrities" and witchcraft charges against her, which means she will be burned at the stake. Elvira manages to be sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while making crazy jokes and offering extravagant lines with two meanings. <br /> <br /> This film is inspiring because it conveys the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. In the end, Elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that can happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie countless times and I never tire of doing it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself captivated throughout the entire film. A review will not do justice to the movie itself, so I can only tell you to watch it PLEASE because it's one of the best movies ever made. Meanwhile, I wish you "unpleasant dreams! ''
