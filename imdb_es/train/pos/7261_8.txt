I totally disagree with "ctomvelu" regarding the talent of Jim Belushi. I really like Belushi. It is true that I was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene, because he was a big fan of his late brother John. But Jim has a charm on the screen that has taken him far, and has developed well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of her previous films: her weight is a gift (is not that true for most of us?) - and I like the movie, yes, it's touching and comforting, so that if you like car chases, explosions and free sex, then you may want to convey it: it's a warm movie of three lost soles that meet each other Do not get me wrong, I'm in favor of the three keys before mentioned for a successful movie, but I also like a beautiful and solid story like this. <br /> <br /> And although Belushi and Kelly Lynch provide excellent performances, the real star of this film is Alisan Porter, who is absolutely adorable . <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened to her career, but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball (the agent, the parents, herself?) must shoot. introduction to the fame more perfect than this movie, and still not s He has heard nothing from her. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
