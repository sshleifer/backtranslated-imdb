I just finished listening to the director's comments for this movie, and I think the only thing I got from her that I agree with is that this movie, like Mann's The Insider, is completely subjective. It's from Howard's POV. Therefore, any revision or attempt to contemplate a set of comments about it, as Ebert did, is really about Nolte's character in reality. If you feel, as he did, that the movie "does not work," then you're saying, I think, that Howard does not work. And, to be frank, you may be right. Howard's reasoning and personality would not really resist professional mental analysis and treatments. <br /> <br /> But, hey, that's the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
