I've known Bettie Page for many years. The soft core pornographic images of her since the 1950s have become iconographic and even today they have a strong appeal. The "Bettie Page" aspect also remains very popular in the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it was then. So I saw this movie with a bit of familiarity to begin with. The result did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was very entertaining to see the re-creation of the film of real figures such as Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager. they all consider pioneers today. Mary Harron did an excellent job creating the desired environment of sexual repression and hypocrisy in the United States of 1950 along with a sexuality that, by current standards, was extremely innocent. I especially liked the use of monochrome against color as a visual abbreviation for the emotional and spiritual climate in which Bettie was. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of Bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her absolute naivety. Bettie loved to look pretty, loved attention, saw nothing wrong with nudity and enjoyed dressing in "stupid attire" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that he evoked were completely lost in her. To this day, he still does not understand "what all the fuss was about" when it comes to his photos or the S & M content of them. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that you have no education or that it is too simple to do so. I understand that it's just that she simply does not "understand" about fetishism and never will. There is no harm there. Bettie Page is simply being who she is. The movie captured this very well. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s represented by Mrs. Harron and written by her along with Guinevere Turner makes me truly happy to live the day and age at which I do it. Hypocrisy and repression combined with massive ignorance about our sexuality combined in a terribly suffocating world. The film captures this well and makes it cheer while Bettie supports it all with her unwavering faith and her immutable naivety. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit slow at times, but it affected all the points that Mrs. Harron tried and hit. they good. I would recommend this movie even for those people with little or no knowledge of who Bettie Page was and what effect it had on American culture. For those with such interests, then this movie is a must see.
