Two sailors are on leave: the ladies Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and the shy and innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet the beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There's more, but you probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> The story (even for a 1940 musical) is ridiculous and everything is very beautiful and healthy: it becomes annoying pretty fast. Also this movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and that's too much for such a silly story. There are also some boring numbers of Jos√© Iturbi and his orchestra. Still, it's worth catching. <br /> <br /> When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing, this becomes magical. None of the songs is particularly memorable, but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice that you will not mind. It is shot in a rich Technicolor with all the brightness that MGM had. The acting is fine. Kelly is fine (although seeing him as a female is pushing him) and Sinatra is just great (although seeing him as a shy man was also pushing him!). Grayson is not given anything to do, but it's incredibly beautiful to look at. Some shots of it literally took my breath away! There are many highlights here: the great number of dancing and singing of Sinatra and Kelly; Sinatra singing anything; The two songs of Grayson and the famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry, an animated mouse! Tom makes a funny cameo too. There is also the little Dean Stockwell who steals all the scenes in which he is. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and the plot does not hold up but it's still worth seeing. This was a great success in his day.
