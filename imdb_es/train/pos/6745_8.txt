"A sequence of Turkish baths in a film noir located in New York in the 50s, that should be a sign of something! Something that curiously, in all the previous comments, nobody has pointed out, but I think it is essential for the understanding of this film <br /> <br /> the sequence of the Turkish baths: a back street at night, the entrance of A poor quality sauna, and Scalise wrapped in a sheet, receiving her massage thighs. Steve, the masseur is the young, tough boxer (Beefcake!), And another man, a bodyguard? He just got dressed. Dixon obviously hates what he sees there and gets hard immediately. We know he has a reputation for mistreating suspects. Good police but out of control easy. Why is it that he hates them so much? <br /> <br /> It may be that he hates himself. This part of himself that he inherited from his father? That dark side that could take him right to the end of the sidewalk, to the gutter? What if that dark side was hidden inside a "closet"? Remember: every time Dixon meets Scalise (3 times), the man is lying in a bed, and he only has men around him for company (the irony of the "Girls" poster stuck on the wall near his bed !). <Br /> <br /> Scalise acts in a funny way: affected manners, stretching his neck arrogantly, defiantly, sticking his inhaler (poppers?) Into his nose every time he talks to Dixon. Dixon, with a vengeance, insists on repressing Scalise, who seems not to understand: "I never saw a man as full of hate as you, I consider it almost comical the way you persecuted me alone". Four years jumping towards me. As if I was someone special! Why? "<br /> <br /> Because Scalise is really someone special: he is the direct heir of Dixon's father:" Your father liked him, "" Your father put me in motion. "He is Dixon's criminal brother, his dark side embodied, and to top it off, he prefers the company of men Dixon knows it well: "Who killed him (Paine)? You or one of your playmates? "Playmates! See how every time they meet, Dixon mistreats Scalise: he pulls the address book out of his jacket, slaps his face, punches him." Scalise: "I warn you not to touch me! "Dixon's homophobia is obvious, or to put it another way: his unspoken homosexuality, Dixon, also known as Dixon's boy, is the son of a thief." In response to this, he decided to become a policeman, a good one. but there is something of the delinquent in him, a dark side: he is a violent collector, a murderer, a liar, and he is not married, he occasionally takes "a dizzy blonde" to his family place to eat, but Nothing else, the waitress mocks and says she does not know how to make love to a woman, Dixon has a deep sense of guilt and hates himself for those reasons. " A hood and a mobster like his old man. The blood will tell. "Finally, to achieve redemption, Dixon decides to sacrifice himself: if he manages to get his alter ego Scalise to kill him, he will be freed from guilt and will also free the girl and her father. <br /> <br /> The end of the film brings us back to the opening sequence: Scalise is pushed into the ditch and Dixon deserves the right to walk on the sidewalk and wins the lady's love, finally it's straight. <br /> <br /> The tacit theme of the film could very well be that of a man who, to cover his repressed feelings, wishes to experience the love of a woman (Jean Douchet) <br /> <br /> (These notes owe a lot of Comment on Jean Douchet's film on the French DVD edited by CarlottaI.
