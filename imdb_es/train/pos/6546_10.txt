I'm probably one of Nancy Drew's biggest fans. I have read each book three times and played many of the Nancy Draw games. I really liked that movie. It kept you entertained the entire time you saw it. I went with about 10 of my friends and they all LOVED me. There were three women sitting behind us who seemed to be between 30 and 40 and I asked them if they liked it, they said they loved it! So you see that it will be an entertainment for all ages. You just have to give it a try. And it also teaches a lesson, just be yourself, even if everyone around you is exactly the same. So in general, this movement was great. I'm going to see it a second time now! So stop hitting him please. It's a really good movie!
