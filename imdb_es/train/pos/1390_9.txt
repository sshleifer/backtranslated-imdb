If you like the science fiction of cult 70, like me, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai", you'll love this one. It's a spectacular sci-fi consciousness stream of the 70s, which includes a 22nd-century scrap yard and Earth within a million years. This movie is pure from the 70's. Put on "Fly Like An Eagle" by Steve Miller or "Dark Side Of The Moon" by Pink Floyd, and that's it!
