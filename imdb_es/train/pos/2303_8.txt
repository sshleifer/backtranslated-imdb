THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving drama that focuses on a family of farmers in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who falls in love with a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) who ends up falling in love with his older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters the dynamics of this family. Forever. Here the 1950s is lovingly evoked and the script offers you characters that interest you almost immediately. Witherspoon is already beginning to show the Oscar-winning talent he would develop in this first role and London becomes a charming protagonist. Warfield gives a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister who is also effective. Congratulations to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who play the parents of the girls, and Gail Strickland, who plays the mother of London. I was unexpectedly surprised by this silent drama that affected strong emotions and gave a deeper meaning to the phrase "family ties".
