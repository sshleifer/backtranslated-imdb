This film has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, ingenious wit, great acting and a good dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this film very much and I was attracted by its original plot (based on the novel by Neil Gaiman that I am now looking to read) and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most surprising thing for me was actually how self-contained the story is. Unlike so many science fiction fantasy films that exist at the moment, which leave an open ending, it is a pure fairytale, satisfying in itself, without the need for a sequel. <br /> <br /> Original. Funny. Fantasy of feeling good.
