Famous was "famous" for its tension and style of launching cartoons where the semi-main character is in terrible danger, only to be rescued by the hero at the last second. This particular Casper is the only one I can remember where death actually takes a hand. But even in death, there is still a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The constant in Famous Studios cartoons is that "virtue always triumphs". Popeye always arrives at his spinach in time, Baby Huey always surpasses the fox, Little Audery always "learns his lesson". And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You have to give them credit. As much as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry", I do not think anyone was launching a better cartoon product at that moment than Paramount. Color, animation, music (the great Winston Sharples), edition, voices. They were consistent and a shining example of the best that the art form had to offer.
