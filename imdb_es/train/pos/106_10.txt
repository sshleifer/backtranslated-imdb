The first von Trier movie I've seen was breaking the waves. Sure, a good movie, but it's definitely in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells the story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany right after the Second World War. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purse in a luxury train. Due to his work, he travels through a Germany almost completely destroyed, meets with the murder of traitors and seeks former members of the Nazi party. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle has reduced his consciousness by focusing on the work he also has as a purse on the train. By coincidence, the main character was involved in the bombing and terrorism by a group called "werewolves" who pressed him to help them place bombs on the trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man who tries to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to awaken him in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe!!
