This film is a brilliant lesson about Japanese history that began at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before the Shogunate lost a great battle against the loyalist, who wanted the emperor to return to the throne to rule Japan. Actually, I had to read a lot of history to know the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) offers an excellent performance as Izo Okada, one of the four Hitokiri (= human). Killer) of the Bakumatsu. He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. To have a good life he becomes a retainer of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke of Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultranationalist politician who allows his Hitokiri gang to assassinate many high-ranking pro-Western politicians to achieve their political goals. Izo Okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing. As long as he has money to go drink and spend with his whore. Okada's murders become increasingly brutal during the course of the film and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> It is a splendid portrait of the life of a simple samurai who is involved in political affairs and it is really naive to realize what is happening. First, after being betrayed and tortured, and always having conversations with Sakamoto (who is a samurai who rejects violence), he changes his ideas and views about life. But too late ... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff provide a brilliant performance. Each actor reaches his role. The sword fights are very unique and fast ... probably faster than several movies today ... <br /> <br /> Take a look if you have the chance!
