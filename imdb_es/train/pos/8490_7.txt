I recently saw this movie in my International Business class. I did not expect anything more than another boring documentary (not to say that I do not love documentary, I just have a lot of bad luck with films of that kind). Imagine my surprise when this movie emerged, which is really a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a demonstration of cultural differences in the workplace and how they should cooperate to get anywhere. Cultural shock shows how different the world is and how different we perceive ourselves until someone arrives and gives us a wake-up call. I would recommend this movie to anyone in the business or who just wants to laugh, because yes, it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's it! Cheers
