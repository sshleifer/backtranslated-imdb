The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sexual comedy starring Bond's only girl, Ursula Andress. In this movie, the man was sexy. It was stacked and built like a brick house * @ #%. Ursula was smoking hot in this movie. I have never seen a nurse costume that has been filled before. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Andress plays a nurse hired to care for a rich old man. Even one in the house seems to be hitting the boots. One night, the nurse decides to take the grandson's temperature and give him some T.L.C. to your old client. The old man takes his nurse and this angers the rest of the family. For what kind of work was the family hired to do it? Will the geezer fall for the donor of his car? How can you deal with the octogenarian witch and the rest of the family? To find out, you need to find a copy of the SENSUAL NURSE! Italian but poorly bent to English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
