I have the feeling that Warner Bros. Depression-era musicals are going to be much more pertinent in the coming years. Yes, we are in the economic crisis (or have been living under a rock) and the times look bleak. But we always have movies as a way to escape from our problems. In the 30s, cinema was very popular even at the height of economic darkness. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one of those films that audiences flocked to. While this musical directed by Lloyd Bacon does not capture the social problems of the time as does "Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)", it is still a wonderful showcase of talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie for the three extravagance numbers of Busby Berkely, but it's worth waiting for me. Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her tapping is regular, but Busby's magical "By A Waterfall" moves her to it, and what appear to be another hundred chorus girls, to a wonderful world of water . Of course, Busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage (on the one hand, they defy the limits of gravity), and they contrast tremendously with the realism of non-musical scenes, difficult and full of curiosities. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney in one of his few musicals (actually, what is this man could not do?). He even takes over the leader, puts on a sailor suit and takes over the sexpot Shanghai Lil (which is actually the little Ruby with a Chinese girl's wig!). She is co-star of Joan Blondell, her adorable and loving secretary, who somehow Cagney is overlooked in favor of other women (until the final roll, that is). Apparently, Blondell was the only other woman Cagney loved apart from his wife. And you can see the mutual adoration in each scene.
