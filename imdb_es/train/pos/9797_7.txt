Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated Batman direct to video / DVD movies to be released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot revolves around a new crime fighter, Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping a major shipment of weapons. <br /> <br /> Although the film is interesting enough, it is not as good as 'Mask of the Phantasm', 'Sub-Zero' or 'Return of the Joker'. The main reason is that it does not emit the emotional appeal that the other films did. At the end of this movie, we really do not feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others, especially in 'Sub-Zero'. There is no real tragedy that has made the other animated films special to us. Even the Batwoman is not really a "tragic" character (as were Mr. Freeze or the Phantom). Not only that, but Batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly "rigid" and boring that the viewer does not care what happened to him, what made him wear the mask or what happened at the end and that's where the reason lies Mainly we do not receive this special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I found the movie nice. It has its moments, for example, when the public discovers who Batwoman really is and when she sees an old villain who was last seen in the original 'Batman: The Animated Series'. The action is also very pleasant with some moments of great suspense. <br /> <br /> If Batwoman's record was more interesting, this movie would have been better than "Return of the Joker" in my book, but as it stands now, it's in the room (out of a total of 4) . <br /> <br /> As for the animation, it's the same as the cartoon of The New Batman Adventures from the mid-to-late 90s. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 Batman animated films, but it's still being good <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it's nice. But remember, it's not as good as the other animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
