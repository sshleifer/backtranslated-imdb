['If you, like me, have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin ... do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It&#39;s such a brilliant and brilliant production. The background story about Hergé and the people and also many of the different situations in which he was influenced, for better or for worse, is incredible. There is a very good and obvious connection between the comics and only this. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be in my basement digging up Tintin&#39;s albums again. In addition, the film itself is very well told and has a great ambient sound. I really hope people find this as intriguing as I do!']
