I watched the movie before reading Michelle Magorian's book and enjoyed both. The movie, more than the book, made me cry on several occasions. This film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never abandons it. I encourage so many people to see this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible. I give it ten stars.
