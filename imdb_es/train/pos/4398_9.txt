When I heard that this movie was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to watch it. This Taiwanese director rose to fame with "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" a few years ago and then went on to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now, he turns his attention to another American icon: the Civil War. <br /> <br /> This story takes place in Missouri, a state of the Union with southern sympathies. These never officially joined the Confederate army. Instead, they formed outlaws, called "bushwhackers," grew long hair, and sometimes confiscated the Union uniforms they wore over their regular clothes. <br /> <br /> The film describes his moral dilemma, the great drama of The Times and his supposedly heroic missions of killing the shopkeepers and farmers who helped the Union. There are no stars in this movie, unless you consider "Jewel" the singer, well chosen as a young Confederate widow as a star. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire is a young German peasant who makes fun of him. His inheritance because the Germans were supposed sympathizers of the union. This young man is an excellent actor, full of young people with a fresh face, whose performance encompasses his astonishment and his subtle realizations when exposed to the horror of war. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave who travels with the kidnappers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. It gives a fine and discreet performance. <br /> <br /> However, part of the performance is of wood, especially in the long conversations they have about morality. And their suits are too new. And the theme of the "southern gentleman" of manners and the inclination of the hats and the courtesy towards women is somewhat excessive, especially because they intend to kill all the men who pull the arms of their women and then set fire to the shops . and the houses. <br /> <br /> Although I do not think this will happen as one of Lee Ang's "great" films, it fascinated me, despite the slow parts and their excessive length. of 140 minutes. I was interested in what happened next and felt empathy for each of the characters who found themselves as real and imperfect human beings trapped in the forces of history. <br /> <br /> Not as much as the usual war. Film, but still recommended, especially for fans of the Civil War. <br /> <br />
