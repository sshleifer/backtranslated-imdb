['All Dog&#39;s Go to Heaven is a lively children&#39;s movie like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, weapons and hell are prominent in the plot, and although children will get very little of that, adults will realize why this movie felt like a kind of movie of gangsters. The film itself is not explicit in any way, it&#39;s just a strange combination to make a movie for children. <br /><br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog, who owns half a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After getting drunk (a dog ... getting drunk ... in a children&#39;s movie, it just sounds weird), Charlie is cheated and killed by Carfax. When he is in heaven, he finds a way to return to Earth, but he will no longer be allowed in heaven. He still returns to Earth and meets his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise), and plans to recover Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a little orphan girl, Anne Marie, captive because of her incredible ability to talk to all animal species, which helps predict races. Charlie and Itchy free her, and try to help her find a family, while learning a lot about themselves. <br /><br /> This film is one of the few that are not from Disney and that will appeal to both children and adults. Children will enjoy the fun characters and animated animations, while adults will enjoy the sweet and pleasant plot, and the characters developed more than usual. One thing that keeps this down, is that it&#39;s a musical. Normally, that&#39;s a good thing, but the music here is honestly terrible. They tend to jump, almost sounding ad libbed, with almost no instrumental backing. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I&#39;ve ever heard in an animated movie, but fortunately, the rest of the movie is strong enough not to fall apart due to some bad grades. <br /><br /> The end of this movie works, but I honestly hate it. It&#39;s sad, but happy, but sadder than happy, and makes the movie look like it needs a sequel. Considering how bad the sequel to this was, I wish the ending would not have justified a sequel and would have ended in a nice and super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I feel that way about, but I do. <br /><br /> In general, this is a good family movie, with strange themes, but nonetheless, good entertainment. <br /><br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 85 minutes SUN.']
