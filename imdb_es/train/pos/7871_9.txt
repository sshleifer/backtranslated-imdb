Madhur Bhandarkar does everything possible to tackle taboo subjects and offers the most realistic image of modern society. One has the impression of the director even of his previous films like Satta and Chandni bar. The themes that are mentioned in this last film are explored and exhibited in full here. The casting is amazing and one can see the judgments in each scene from many angles. Above all, the movie leaves you wondering about many facts about it. As you start to guess things, you end up in most cases close by, but you miss the mark in many scenes. It leaves a lasting impression at the end. <br /> <br /> The actors to watch are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni among others. The dialogues are well written and you feel that you have lived around some of these people. There are still some scenes that make you think of more depths. The songs are in the background and the voice of Lata in a very significant song "Kitne Ajeeb" makes you feel that you are alone in the middle of modern society!
