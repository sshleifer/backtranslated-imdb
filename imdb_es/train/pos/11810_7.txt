Although I still liked it. Warren Beatty is just like the comic book hero. What saves this movie is the whole, the incredible cast and that emits a mediocre script. I really expected something more substantial in terms of action or plot, but I have very little. The main reason to see this movie is to see some of the biggest stars of Hollywood at that time in such an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> The only person who did a terrible job and who did not even belong to this movie was Madonna. She did not belong to this movie and her work as an actor was pretty bad. The movie at some points simply stopped. You expected something more and you have nothing. Al Pacino plays a really bad guy and he does it quite well. He and Beatty make an excellent good and bad boy. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a movie that is not Isthar. I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things. The good thing about this movie is that it's good, but it could have been much better. I liked it as a girl because I thought it was great, and visually the movie is amazing, the stages are incredible, the writing is fair and, with a cast in the film, I would expect a little better anyway. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I especially thought that the end was not big enough. It was interesting, but for a full-scale movie, I thought it might have ended with a bit more of an explosion. The reason to see this movie is the atmosphere. The film only uses the 7 colors of comics, which makes it even more visually excellent anyway. <br /> <br /> The costumes and makeup were also impeccable. The facial makeup for the villains was great. Beatty is not capable of a character as big as life. Still, this is a good movie that could have been much more. For me it's better than Batman, the other comic book adaptation that came out almost at the same time. Of course the movie was much bigger in terms of gross.
