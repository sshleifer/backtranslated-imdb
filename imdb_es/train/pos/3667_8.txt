Hollywood North is a satirical look at the time in the history of Canadian cinema when the Canadian government offered huge tax cuts for films made in Canada. Most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to make American movies. For example, Porky came out of that. Anyway, Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved Canadian novel. However, to get the money, you need a star with an American name. He gets a loose cannon and learns that he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book on which it was originally based. It plays well in Canada, but it may not be understood outside the Great White North. Americans will think that we are satirizing ourselves, but we will not understand the fact that we are actually satirizing them. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
