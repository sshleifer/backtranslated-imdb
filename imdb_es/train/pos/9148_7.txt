['A very undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in a spiral of domestic violence in constant decline. <br /><br /> In difficult times to see, while Morris Day is presented as the misogynist, the Prince as the gentleman on the motorcycle, he is still asked to hit a woman twice as part of the script. That he can do this and still emerge as a defective but vindicated hero is due to writing. Prince is so ego-free in this film that he not only presents himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who hits women, but his most famous song is fictional and written by his father, Wendy and Lisa. Moreover, two of his compositions, Computer Blue (the weakest track on the album) and Darling Nikki, are shown as songs that kill the public. Perhaps the only ego concession Princely is a letter that lists Apollonia (slightly shorter than the Prince) as 5&#39;6. <br /><br /> The almost complete cast of fans are mainly members of the band that play themselves (and critics who talk about the actors in terms that have never appeared in other movies are missing the point), and do it perfectly well under the direction. Morris Day receives most of the applause for his friendly ham, although Jerome Benton must also get credit for bouncing well in him, particularly in his performance on stage, which is very funny. Day and Benton even go so far as to make a routine of Abbott and Costello fun, which requires a little effort. <br /><br /> Finally, there is a prince. Although I admit that I&#39;m partial, I actually think he&#39;s a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a discrete version of himself. Acting IS NOT his profession, this was a movie made for entertainment, so anyone who points out that the main role guy is not Robert DeNiro and who thinks they are making a point, is sadly misleading. I do not want this review to be a laughable attack on other people&#39;s comments, but even this movie has a low budget and is poorly lit. How would a movie about domestic violence be filmed, then? With full bulbs and a CGI dinosaur entering the frame? <br /><br /> The film acts almost like a perfect snapshot of the era of neon light and thin tie ... until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly permanent and tin synthesizers, and this is not a retro recreation. Prince&#39;s best movie with Oscar-winning music sees it at its peak, and it&#39;s sad to realize that, although he would make some good albums, he would never get that high again.']
