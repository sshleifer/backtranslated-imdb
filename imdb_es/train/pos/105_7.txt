I have to start with Ed Furlong in this case. You have to. God bless this child. $ 5 dollars says that the character he plays in this movie is what he really likes in real life. He has one or two phrases that made me almost fly by the subtle humor of the script. You know all the evidence that this boy has gone through in recent years and it does not even look like Furlong is acting. Maybe that's why his performance was good. The same with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet this guy is really like that in real life." Does Madsen even have to act? Simply natural. Vosloo, obviously, has moved from the Mummy type. I think the biggest surprise of this movie was the performance of Jordana Spiro. Your reactions are successful in this movie. I struggled if she was hot or not, but I realized that I would like to see more of her. <br /> <br /> He's not a big fan of shooting or hostage-type movies. But what I am a fan of are the films with many twists and turns to try to keep guessing. Not only do standard thieves take over a bank, they kill hostages and the good ones win in the type of final film. The twists keep coming ... and they come. <br /> <br /> Cafe scenes work best with handheld cameras to show how it really is there. It is not overlooked a little. Think like the "lite" style of Bourne Ultimatum in some scenes in the cafeteria. <br /> <br /> And for Bo Bice fans, actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will make a double decision. These boys are twins. <br /> <br /> As I watched them, I wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what they did in this small town. It made sense in the end that these people would smuggle things to other countries / states so that they could have these accents. But it is further revealed in the additional features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars that we may not have heard of. And some of them are smoking hot. Moncia Dean? I need to say more.
