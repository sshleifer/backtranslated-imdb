Everyone knows about this event '' Day Zero ''. What I think this movie did that Elephant did not do is that they made us see what these guys were like. They showed their lives for about a year. Throughout the film, we can like to laugh with them even though we know what they are going to do. And that gives me the creeps. Because I felt guilty about being encouraged by his comments, and I just thought that Cal was a sweet guy. Even though I KNEW what was going to happen, you know? Even at the end of the movie, when they were about to commit suicide and simply deciding if they did it at 3 or 4, I thought it was funny, but even so I was horrified to see their heads blown away. Of course I was. I have to like them. They were bad, maybe, but I felt they were really normal guys, who really did not notice. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> That's it, IMO, the main strength of this movie. It makes us realize that our friends, relatives, or anyone, may be planning something crazy, and that we will not even notice it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can not go to sleep now. There is still this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies
