Pecker is another conventional movie by John Waters made in a movie smaller than Serial Mom. The title character of Pecker has the fondness to take pictures of everything he sees. It does not matter if it is dirty or shocking when you take pictures. He soon uses the photos he took and shows them in his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle class family. His father works in a bar with a claw machine, but he does not make enough money with a lesbian bar on the street. Her mother has a thrift store and she loves to disguise the poor. Her older sister, Tina, works in a gay bar where her specialty is commerce. Their youngest son, Little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar and nothing but sugary foods. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays ventriloquist with her. He also has 2 friends. Of his friends, Matt is a chronic thief and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a laundry mat as if she were a dictator. Soon, a tourist from New York buys his photos and shows them in an art gallery. Fame comes with the image, but the images expose the unusual lifestyle of the simple life of friends and family. For an R-rated film, Pecker is safer than most of Waters' previous R-rated films and even pink flamingos. Another 10 out of 10!
