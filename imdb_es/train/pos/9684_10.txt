This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to get to the heart of the audience, directing this wonderful image where life is seen through Paulie's mind and heart. From time to time we discover, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I just could not contain my tears, even though the movie has a happy ending. This is great, after thousands of movies that I saw throughout my life, "Paulie" really touched me deeply. This is, after "Ugly Duckling", the second image that really turned me around.
