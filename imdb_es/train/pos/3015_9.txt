Why can not this kind of compact and entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way. The cast is a great ensemble. William Powell exhibits true star quality. Who knows, maybe he was rehearsing his future as Nick Charles. It is a joy to see. You can also see why Eugene Pallette made more than 200 movies. He is a great supporting actor and his excellent chemistry with Powell is fun to watch. Mary Astor does an above-average job in a not very fleshy role. All other hands come together to make this a pleasant way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect that Michael Curtiz had a ball directing his. Bravo!
