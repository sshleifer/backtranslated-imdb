The synopsis of this movie does a great job explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Well shot Hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, although some shots look EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /> <br /> However, there are some photos that really look good and show some imagination on the part of Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a solid story with some great twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun and, best of all, darkened enough to turn them into real twists. <br /> <br /> The children's actors in the movie also do a great job. I usually distrust movies with children in leading roles because too often they go out as Nickelodeon rejects, but these two children do a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not bloody. It is not very scary. But it's very, very creepy.
