['He may be one of the few who really clung to this movie. I also saw this movie when it came out, and I agree with the latest publication that Up The Acedemy was way ahead of its time. The humor in the film itself is pure MAD magazine. I do not see why MAD is behind this feature. It was also one of the few films of the early 80&#39;s in which an assassin accompanied the soundtrack of the punk and new wave bands that emerged from Los Angeles at that time. I own the soundtrack and I play it constantly until today. What can I say? There are definitely worse movies than there are. I do not think Porky is as fun as Up The Academy, there are some really good laughs throughout the movie, and the jokes are based on stereotypes or sex. Hey, nobody said it was going to be the Maltese Falcon.']
