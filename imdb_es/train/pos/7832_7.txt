I finally got my desire to see this in a movie theater. I had seen Fritz Lang's movie on video a few years ago. He hoped that the ideal conditions of projection would work with his magic. <br /> <br /> Conditions were ideal at Cinematheque Ontario. Pristine full length print. Intertitles in the original Gothic-German script with simultaneous translation into English, accurate without being too literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the movie came up for a moment, but finally it could not catch it, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have a real relationship with the Wagner Ring cycle as I have already done. I knew but some may not. Wagner had adapted the 13 c. Niebelungenlied to their own ends. Part I of Fritz Lang's epic, "Siegfried", is very familiar to Wagner's listeners. <br /> <br /> "Kriemhild's Revenge" is the story of Siegfried's wife, Kriemhild, her marriage to King Etzel. (Attila) the Hun, and his desire for revenge against Hagen and Gunther, the Nibelungs renamed, for the murder of Siegfried. The spectacular conflagration in this film supposedly evolved and expanded into the Wagnerian myths in his Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods and the end of Valhalla. This movie remains on earth. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spectacular. The massive groups rival those of "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired the "Intolerance" of Griffith (1916). Its decoration establishes a new point of reference in the barbarian splendor. There is a huge cast of hordes, cunning men and Burgundian art deco. And battles. Battles that never seem to end in fact. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in her revenge plan. She manages to destroy her around. His loyalty to his martyr Siegfried does not seem to derive as much from love or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth shouted: "Stay here with me." She knew that she was not emotionally prepared for what she had to do. But Kriemhild does not show normal human emotions, and certainly nothing compares to the feminine principle. She is already "full of extreme cruelty," to borrow Shakespeare's phrase from the beginning. Margarethe Schön and her director convey this with a withering look. I do not want to exaggerate, but that expression is practically the only expression that "animates" Kriemhild's face. It's the latest in one-note presentations. However, it is clearly intentional, not simply a case of poor performance. <br /> <br /> What we have on offer is a one-dimensional sketch of a vengeful Fury. Some might see Kriemhild as an empowered heroine. I just saw the movie as misogynistic.
