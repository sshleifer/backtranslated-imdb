Or, I love the suspension of any plot of formula in this movie. I've visited again many times and it always holds me up. A bit too stylized for some, but I think any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a Canadian fellow, has huge opportunities with his films and his casting, and almost always worth it in films that are off center and, in a way, delicious, like this one. I have often wondered about Cher's lack of acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or if she does not have enough good chewing papers. I have found her to be an excellent actress who can retire to a role, as in this particular one or be noisy, daring and fierce as in "Mask". I found the broad comic traits sometimes (a hairdressing salon called "Cinderella") but this was the whole intention of both the writer and the director. Nicolas Page plays the tenor of the opera, full of anguish, all extravagant gestures, at a point that demands a knife to cut his own throat. The scenes of Brooklyn are magical, this is a Brooklyn under the light of the moon, romantic and dramatic, like the opera. In general, a very satisfying movie, not much to everyone's taste, I loved the ending, everyone gathered like a Greek choir, each part subtly nuanced and mixed with the others, the camera moves away down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.
