In the year 1990, the world of Disney TV cartoons was certainly at its best. Programs like Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already popular, and now Disney made another great cartoon and that cartoon brought the birth of Disney Afternoon. That cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about the old Jungle Book character, Baloo the Bear, while he gets a job in the aircraft business. In the series, he meets Kit Cloudkicker, former air pirate and good surfer in the cloud, business woman Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and has a lot of great word games that you may not understand as a child, but that you understand later in life. This is a cleverly written series and it's great to add it to your DVD collection. Parents, buy this for your children and do not let them see all those horrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked TaleSpin, check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spin it!
