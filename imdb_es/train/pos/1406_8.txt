['Do you remember &quot;The invisible man&quot; by HG Wells? Well, here is another movie like this, only more extreme. &quot;Hollow Man&quot; does not look like any story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who throws himself into the world of invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. At first, making the serum the easy part, making the person come back was not. Most of the first attempts ended unstable. Until one night, when he perfected the formula. And who else, but Caine would be the laboratory rat. The gorilla was the first and almost died, so when it came, it was close. So when Caine did, he decided to use it to have fun. Then, when he got tired of not being seen, the team did everything possible to return it to the world of meat. However, the visibility formula does not work as it should, and Caine would go into madness. So he ends up being a crazy and invisible murderer. It would be better to leave the city instead of taking the lives of the people who are close to you. I would care less for those who did you wrong. Great movie, lots of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!']
