Police Story is an impressive series of pieces for Jackie Chan to showcase his unique talents and bravery. Some of the acrobatics here are among Jackie's best and most dangerous. The end of the fight in the mall is probably Jackie's best fight sequence. More brutal and less comical. Then, Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight, you can almost feel the pain. The impact. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, the rest of the film does not respect this quality, since it is a policeman thriller quite formulated with some elements of comedy. I always prefer JC in films like Project A, where they shine through their natural comedic talents. In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story, it just does not work for me. Having said that, even though this is still up to date with the best Jackie films due to the incredible work of doubles and the great show. <br /> <br /> As usual in Hong Kong movies, avoid the English dubbed version of the DVD, as it is really horrible to stay with it. the subtitles. <br /> <br /> Excellent stunts, good movie, a good starting point if you have not seen a JC movie before and it's worth watching for any fan of the movie 7/10
