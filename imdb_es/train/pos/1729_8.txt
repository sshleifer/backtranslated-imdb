In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape from a prisoner of war camp using a gymnastic jumping horse in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to film his account and started a peculiar story of the Military Prison Camp of the British film genre that reached its peak in Danger Within (1959). <br /> <br /> The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest movies I've ever seen. There are no great dramatic moments, but a constant plot eventually becomes a climax that has more tension because the story does not give way to the improbable drama, sudden jumps or fucks (something is about to happen!) Music. It is completely of its time and works perfectly. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a cast of extra extras curiously low and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and silent. They keep emotion out of their roles. As many of them were, until recently, former service, I suspect they recreated their wartime roles as "Officers and Knights". <br /> <br /> This non-emotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most Wartime Escape films, the story does not end in the barbed wire: and that single fact keeps me stuck at the end.
