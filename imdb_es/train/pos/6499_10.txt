After all these years, I still consider this series as the best example of the making of documentary films of the Second World War. Interviews with the many participants from all countries differentiate it from any other project. It would be great to see a contemporary documentalist (Ken Burns?) Address this issue and try to gather information from veterans before they are finished. With modern technology to improve old archive images and the large amount of information that has been unearthed since 1974, when The World At War was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. The History Channel has done some good shows that deal with many aspects of World War II, but an expansive series like World At War has not been attempted successfully since the original version. If you are interested in this era do not miss this series. Visualization required
