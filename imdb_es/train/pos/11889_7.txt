Melodrama of low life well done but basically sad, that, according to the interview that accompanies Isabelle Huppert, the writer / director Pialat with a lot of autobiographical details; taking into account that the main characters do not sympathize, does not make any compliments, and it seems that he was a man with problems, since Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days during filming! <br /> <br /> However, the performance is uniformly excellent; Despite their relatively young age, Huppert and his co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) Were already at the forefront of modern French stars, a state that, with varying degrees of success, both continue to stand today. <br /> <br /> I have 3 more Pialat movies in my stack "VHS To Watch", although all in French without English subtitles; Due to this fact, but also to the oppressive realism of LOULOU, despite its undeniable artistic merit, I can not say that I have any particular hurry to verify them now ...
