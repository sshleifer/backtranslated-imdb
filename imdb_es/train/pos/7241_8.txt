Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual who earned his living as a waiter at <br /> <br /> "Grand Slam", directed by William Dieterle (1933). It's a surprisingly funny satire of celebrity building. The bartender and the girl in the Russian restaurant's hats check, played by Loretta Young, become the brides of America as bridge partners who do not fight. With the help of publicist and ghost writer 'Speed' McCann (the incredibly inexperienced Frank McHugh) they become mobile ads <br /> <br /> for the "Stanislavsky system", a "system" of bidding what one feels as <br /> <br /> (since the offers are not rational, there is no basis for recriminations about their stupidity). <br /> <br /> A duel with the guru of the displaced bridge Cedric Van Dorn (sounds close to Goren, right? and I suspect that the choice of the name of the character "Stanislavsky" was also a blow in another type of system) , an inflated charlatan played very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk, is broadcast on radio stations across the United States as an award-winning fight by Roscoe Karns (another great comic actor of the 1930s). <br /> <br /> Bridge players are even in a roped square, although the public is <br /> <br /> above them, unlike in the "rings" of boxing. <br /> <br /> The great variety of American types prefigures the Preston Sturges comedies, although for the celebrity of the manufacture, "Grand Slam" most remembers two best films of the same time (before the Code) with Lee Tracy playing publicists <br /> <br /> quick conversation: "The Half-Naked Truth" and "Bombshell", but "Grand Slam" has its moments <br /> <br />, especially for anyone who has played bridge with serious points <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a clothesline. (For me, his face seems a little long <br /> <br /> and also a horse.Another notion of beauty of the time, I suppose ...) The film, unfortunately, leaves Glenda Farrell, who plays the forgetful girlfriend of McHugh <br /> <br />.
