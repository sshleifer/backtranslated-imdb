After having seen this nice little comic movie, you will surely feel better. We applaud Yves B. Pelletier for giving birth to this wonderful little film, which, in my opinion, will be recognized as a 2004 film for Quebec. The actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon offer a moving performance. I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives to those that Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain gave me. So if you like the magnificent film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I would say that you would also like the first film by Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants.
