It is a testament to Gosha's incredible cinematic prowess that he was able to complete both Hitokiri and his impressive masterpiece, Goyokin, in the same year, 1969. And it is a testament to how criminally undervalued it is to the general public (compared to the media, dear ones like the great Akira Kurosawa), both Hitokiri and Goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo: killer of crazy dogs, loyal to Tosha clan and his boss Takechi, played by another hardcore of the genre, Tatsuya Nakadai. The Tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the Emperor against the Shogunate. The historical context is quite accurate: the growing political agitation of Japan between the imperialists and the Tokugawa and the pressure of the West to put an end to 300 years of social and political isolation. It helps a lot to know one or two things about Japanese history and what eventually led to the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the Tokugawa shogunate, but it is not essential in any way. The film was made mainly for a Japanese audience, so certain things are taken for granted but they flow very well also for the uninitiated. <br /> <br /> As expected from a film by Hideo Gosha in his golden years (the late 60s) the visual palette is impressive, the use of external and internal symbolism hides behind pictorial beauty. However, the style is never decorative for Gosha, but is always used in the service of history. <br /> <br /> And speaking of a story, Hitokiri is literally and figuratively dominated by the tortured main character Izo Okada. Like most of the protagonists of chambara, Izo is in a double moral bond, divided between giri (obligation) and ninjo (natural impulse), although it takes a while to realize what exactly is his giri. In the first half of the film, Izo is trying to progress socially. Great aspirations of social rank and marriage with the daughter of an aristocrat, a great progression for someone from a past of farmers in the rigid system of social castes of the 19th century in Japan. <br /> <br /> The turning point for Izo is when he realizes at what cost comes the self-advance, the loss of identity and, therefore, the loss of himself. It is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous Tosha Clan swordsman to a "nameless" tramp without past or future, Torazo the Vagrant. Although he is not technically nameless and is not a genius of Yojimbo's style, it is the loss of his old self and the abandonment of ego, ambition and self-illusion that allows Izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself. . <br /> <br /> Hitokiri ends (which I will not reveal here) in the best way any story can end: both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives Izo the last laugh, a final sardonic comment on the face of death.
