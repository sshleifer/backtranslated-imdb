['&quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; (1970): This was especially interesting for me personally, since it takes place under identical circumstances, with identical partners, in my own life: the counterculture movement of the late 60s and early 70s, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories, which slowly intertwine. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless and pseudo-revolutionary talk in the classrooms and canteens of his campus, and the other, a young woman who goes to Phoenix to see his father and employer, and assumes a charge. &quot;Establishment&quot; of work. The film is COMPLETE of the visual notations of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni) of America, and, the confused psychedelic self-sufficiency of that era, &quot;we know everything, we will change everything for the best&quot; youth. Who is the &quot;revolutionary&quot;? What does that REALLY mean? Do you dress like one and march around the edge? &quot;You fly under the radar&quot; but you advise in advance of your arrival? Do you keep your plans for yourself, and do you deal with the business of change, without the need for group approval? &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; is definitely a &quot;period piece&quot;, full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surreal movie moments (after all, this is a film about the man who gave us the incredible &quot;Blow Up&quot; of 1966) and the artefacts of the era. , but it&#39;s more. It presents options for the cultural revolution and, following the example of Antonioni (who seems to support it), young people get too involved to see what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful and terrifying movie that applies to anyone, anytime, anywhere.']
