['This movie was very, very strange and very, very funny. All the actors are quite real and very rare. The general &quot;look&quot; of the film was also different, a kind of dream and bleached, that only added to the strange, clumsy and strange vibes of the whole thing. <br /><br /> It&#39;s not for everyone, I mean, it&#39;s not what I would call &quot;mainstream&quot;, but that&#39;s what I liked. It&#39;s different from everything I&#39;ve seen before. . . Unpredictable, with a strange rhythm and striking lines in the strangest places. Children are so heartbreaking (and with grains) that you can not help but feel them. In other words, these are far from being &quot;Hollywoodized&quot; versions of adolescents. <br /><br /> Everything, what for me, makes it something good.']
