As one of the previous commentators said, this had the foundations of a great movie, but something happened in the way of delivery. It was a waste because Collette's performance was strange and Williams was credible. I just kept waiting for it to improve. I do not think it was a bad edition or that I needed another director, it could have been just the movie. It appeared like a Canadian movie, something like the first seasons of X-Files. It's not cheap, just hokey. Also, I needed a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump out of your seat. The movie arrived at that moment and then it vanished; Something like a false climax. I can see how the fact of having been too suspenseful would have removed the "reality" of the story, but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the child. This movie must have a director cut that tries to solve these problems.
