Rupert Friend gives a performance, like Prince Albert, that elevates "The Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He is excellent. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a deep, dark depression after the death of Prince Albert and looking into the eyes of Ruper Friend, I understood. The film does not lead to his death but to an incident that could have cost him his life. An act of love I believed it, or should I say, him. I thought that what he felt was real. Nothing and nobody comes close to the delicacy and depth of Friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good, but I did not believe Victoria for a minute. There is no real sense of the time. It may not have been his fault, but his prince deserved the crown.
