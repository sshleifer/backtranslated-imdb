I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was great! Now I'm 26 years old, and my friend has it on DVD! <br /> <br /> We have a beer case and we saw this classic! He did not lose ANY of his kung fu originality! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is something you should see ... the DVD is available. I think this movie is also called "Pick Your Poison". <br /> <br /> Look at it soon!
