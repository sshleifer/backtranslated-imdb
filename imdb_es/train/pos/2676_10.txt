['Every day we can see a lot of movies, soap ... on television. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great movie, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great director-director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see: the first is the Pacula? &quot;The choice of Sophie&quot; with Meryl Streep. The second is &quot;The Journey of Hope&quot;. As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love for others, about the acceptance of another civilization, another way of living. We also have to fight against racism and fascism. We must avoid judging, criticizing; We just have to love our fellow Earth. This wonderful film, helps us to achieve his dream in John (Lennon): Imagine that all the people who live live in peace. These two films are hard to see: look at this, but it sure will hurt you, but better. Great movie, great actors, terrible story, pain and crying guaranteed, but also a better understanding of others. Enjoy it.']
