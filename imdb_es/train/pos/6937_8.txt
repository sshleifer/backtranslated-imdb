This restless west spins the history of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by each and every one. James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the precious Winchester in a shootout, only to lose him in a robbery. The story details Stewart's search for the rifle and some man throughout the film. The rifle changes hands again and again, as if the owner were destined to lose him by violence. The image has a lot of action and suspense when Stewart approaches his quarry. A great cast supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems like a disaster here and the purpose of her role is quite obscure. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teenagers in recent years, have brief but good roles.
