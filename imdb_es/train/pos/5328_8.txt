['I still remember seeing this for the first time on television. I could not believe that TVNZ would leave it on! I had to own it! Much of the humor will be lost among those who are not from New Zealand, but give it a try! <br /><br /> Since I finished the series Back of the Y, Matt and Chris have moved on to bigger and better things (?). Randy Campbell, New Zealand&#39;s greatest daring specialist, has often appeared on the British television series Balls of Steel. Yes, he still f ^ @ ks up all his tricks because he is too drunk. <br /><br /> Also the &quot;house band&quot; Deja Voodoo has since released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band is formed by members of the Back of the Y team and singles like &#39;I would give you one of my beers (but I only have 6)&#39; and &#39;You were not born in the 80s&#39; continues his humor. . <br /><br /> The South-By-Southwest film festival also presented its feature film &#39;The Devil Made Me Do It&#39;, which will be released in early 2008 in New Zealand. <br /><br /> All this, if you do not find these guys fun, then you can only F% ^ K OFF!']
