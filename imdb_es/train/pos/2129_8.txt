Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan that love letters are written without either of them knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can not stand each other. You can guess the rest. It is very well played by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a clever and witty script and looks absolutely stunning. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself thinking I was watching Budapest! Everything looks as perfect and as in a dream. A unique movie Do not miss it!
