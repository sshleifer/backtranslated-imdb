I must say that this was not very exciting, but that I talk about fashion and strange ways of solving a mystery. A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... that's fantastic! I really liked that part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter) is extremely hilarious ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really hopeless ... he should have been more angry with her by the way he has treated him ... <br /> <br /> Alright, this movie is a tour and a fashion in disguise. Anyway, I recommend this movie, just for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More spy movies for teens by Emma Roberts ... Spymate ... remember? She's getting good at this complicated detective job.
