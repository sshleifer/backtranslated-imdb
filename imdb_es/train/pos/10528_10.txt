I was so impressed with Doug McGrath's film version of Jane Austen's novel "Emma" and I loved the music of Rachel Portman, that when I went to the video store one day and discovered that the two had come back together. "Nicholas Nickleby "I rented it immediately without any other consideration. <br /> <br /> I have read the book and, for those fans who are too critical of this adaptation of Jane Austen, I do not know what else McGrath could have done. to capture in a more perfect way the spirit and the main elements of the plot of Miss Austen's work, especially given the limitations of a two-hour film (some of which have complained of being too long!). And as far as Gwen Paltrow's accent is concerned, I must confess that I was not very familiar with her when I first saw her in the theater, and at that moment I was absolutely convinced that she was an English actress. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by those who criticized the film for its exuberant scenery. That is one of the things that I enjoy and I hope to see in the pieces of the time set in the English countryside. The beautiful backgrounds of the film contribute greatly to its appeal and success. If your idea of ​​an escapist fare is somewhat grimmer, then maybe you should rent something like "Death Wish III!" <br /> <br /> The configuration of the English country is as attractive and charming as the cast, and is combined with the history and soundtrack for entertainment that never tires of repeat visits. McGrath is a marvel in the choreography of the interaction of subtle expressions that are so essential to convey the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing movie could also be a clinic about how nice a movie can be. No sex, violence or even an antagonistic villain. The story is often funny, endearing and, at times, quite moving. <br /> <br /> I have seen many competent adaptations of Jane Austen's books, but this is undoubtedly my favorite.
