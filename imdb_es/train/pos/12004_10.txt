This movie is a true and historical film. It is very useful for those who investigate the LDS church, because it is 100% true. It is an excellent film and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> It is very objective, exciting and motivating. There are those who think that it is not a fact, but it is. <br /> <br /> It's about the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the Prophet, Joseph Smith, who restored it. He has events in his life like the illness he had when he was a little boy, his courtship to Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, childbirth, etc. But the most important thing is that it reveals the restoration of the church.
