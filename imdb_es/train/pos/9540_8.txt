Most of the comments I've heard about Meatball Machine have been quite varied. A couple even saying that they think it "stunk". Well, to those people that I say, get some imagination f @ ckin and go to yourself. This was a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical error that attacks and somehow transforms your hosts into these Gwar costumes, the Deathbots called Necroborgs. Over time you learn that these mechanical insects also adhere to a small parasite, which is then able to control your actions due to the hot wiring of your nervous system. Unfortunately for two lonely young adults who are looking for love, they cross paths with the mechanical insect and, before they know it, transformations are taking place and blood is splashing. Is there any way to stop the transformation? Maybe a way to stop this threat of mechanical error? Why do the Necroborgs fight with each other? Can the two desperate singles express their feelings for each other and make the unpleasant? Only one way to find out. <br /> <br /> Upon entering Meatball Machine, I had a bit of caution due to the reactions found, but it turned out to be a big surprise. A few unanswered questions, an average performance at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points that come to mind. From the feel of the anime to the fact that the parasites become small characters and even the feeling of low budget, this film reaches the correct mark much more than what is lost. With a story in constant development that is interesting enough to keep asking questions combined with the effects of make-up and blood spatter, this is a movie that bizarre / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans should review. 8 out of 10
