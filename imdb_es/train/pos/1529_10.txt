Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs I watch regularly on television now. The way in which all the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so different to today's programs, where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and all the others are pushed aside. The way Mark's brain works is also so dark that he never really knows what he's thinking, and if he thinks he's doing it, he's wrong. <br /> <br /> Diagnosis Murder has addressed a wide range of issues, not only in the cases but in each of the characters live personal lives. Everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> As for it being for the elderly? I'm 24 years old!! I still do not think it can be classified as old. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they will release the 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) to be able to see them all in order. It seems that they are doing it with many other programs of the same period, so they can hurry a bit!
