['The director Edward Montagne does in little more than an hour what other more expensive and exaggerated films can not do. Mr. Montagne shows us a police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. that, while not one of the best in the genre, keeps the viewer involved in everything that is happening. <br /><br /> This is clearly a type B movie. In fact, the best thing for &quot;The Tattooed Stranger&quot; is the opportunity to take a look at the appearance of New York in those years. The crystalline cinematography of William O. Steiner has either remained that way over the years, or has been restored with love. <br /><br /> There are excellent views of New York in the opening sequence. Later, they take us to Brooklyn to the Dumbo section and then the film travels to the Bronx and the Gun Hill Road area with its many monument stores in the area. <br /><br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella made a great team of detectives. Patricia Barry is perfect as the plant expert at the Museum of Natural History. Jack Lord, who went to more important things in his career, is seen in a paper that does not speak. <br /><br /> It was very fun to see a city, as it was, because it no longer exists.']
