['This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher / high school baseball coach, who is inspired by his players to prove to professionals and fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the majors. Dennis Quaid, who is no stranger to sports movies, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job recreating the real-world events that led Morris to participate briefly as relief pitcher for the pitiful Devil Rays of Tampa Bay. The first half of the film, which is about his group of high school baseball players (all of whom seem too old to be in high school) is less effective and probably too long. In general, the film suffers some rhythm problems and some additional subplots that we probably could have done without it. However, it is still a fairly immersive film with an inspiring theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason. GRADE B-']
