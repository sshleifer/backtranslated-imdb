I've only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being done almost 30 years ago, I thought that the moments of fear would be rather docile. Boy was wrong There are some great moments that made me feel chills. Even the performance was excellent, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was excellent. <br /> <br /> On the downside, it can be quite slow to start, but once it starts up, there is nothing to stop it. Does all copycats, for example. Nightmare on Elm Street, the scream seems very docile. I can not really say that he is the best of Carpenter because I have not seen many of his, the only one I remember about him is Starman (I think he did it). Halloween is the supreme achievement of the horror genre.
