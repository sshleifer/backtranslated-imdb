A woman who was left alone after her husband's death is attracted to her son's friend and skillful man. In a slightly twisted story, the woman begins to sleep with the practical man in an effort to revive herself. The twisted part? The skilled man is also the love interest of his daughter. <br /> <br /> As if this was not strange enough, the mother falls in love with this man and when her daughter finds out, she not only blames her. A dysfunctional relationship, but also his disordered life with respect to his poor mother. <br /> <br /> Although you may think badly of this woman, the truth is that the film portrays her in a positive way. Very well played by Anne Reid, this character has dimension and portrays a great emotion. <br /> <br /> A truly brilliant performance and a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
