I could not wait to get this in my hands, when I read that Fred Astaire partnered with George Burns and Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music of the Gershwins. Definitely worth seeing, but it lacks the cohesive quality of Fred and Ginger's films. <br /> <br /> The story would probably be better read in a Wodehouse book, where humor is better. Part of the performance is frankly painful to watch (especially the boy and the damsel). <br /> <br /> But ...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but this girl in this movie. Have you ever tried to stand still on one of those spinning disks in a fun house? Imagine tapas in one of high heels! Follows wonderfully with Astaire and adds to the overall quality of the image. <br /> <br /> Several nice, particularly fun songs are Nice Work if you can get it and Riff Upper Lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns and Allen. I had to go back and see the funhouse dance again as soon as the credits ended.
