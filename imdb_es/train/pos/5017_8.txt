I was 15 years old when this movie premiered on television. Being raised in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenage life there. This film touched my impressionable teenage heart and I remembered it fondly for the last 12 years. Recently I was able to watch it for the second, third and fourth time thanks to the channel LOVE. I still cry because the movie arrives and touches my inner confused teenager.
