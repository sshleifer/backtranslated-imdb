A good effort for an Australian show. which is probably not surprising, since there seems to be a resurgence in Australian quality drama. Do I dare to compare this show with the brightness of love in my own way? do not. but it is reminiscent of the early secret life of us. The cast is great, Gibney works his magic in the first two episodes I've seen, the British cast is strong, especially the characters of Callum and Lizzie. but, on the contrary, it may be the saving light (it is not that you need to save) if this show is to get another season. I was not a fan of his performance in the amazing and amazing series of mini time series a few years ago, but it was great as Hal in an ever greener game. It's also good to see Brooke Satchwell again. Hopefully the show continues to improve with each episode.
