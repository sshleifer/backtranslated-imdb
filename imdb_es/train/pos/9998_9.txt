When seeing that the average of votes was quite low, and the fact that the employee of the store of videos thought that it was "well", it did not have many expectations when renting this film. <br /> <br /> But contrary to the above, I enjoyed it a lot. This is a lovely movie. I did not need to grow in myself, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks offers a great performance as the main character, I think it's something different from his usual character in his films. <br /> <br /> There are not many jokes, or something like that, but there are some pretty funny scenes. And, in general, it's a very nice movie and easy to watch. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
