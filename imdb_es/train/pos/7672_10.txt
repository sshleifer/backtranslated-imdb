I must admit that Holly was not on my follow-up list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, after the Festival's Artistic Director specifically recommended this film to an audience of more than 200 people before the screening of another film, I decided to go see it. Woohoo! <br /> <br /> This film deals with the difficult problem of child prostitution and does so without any commitment. I have found myself crying several times during the movie and laughing at the others. Speaking of an emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The main actor (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese newcomer (he was only 14 at the time of filming) and had to face this incredibly complex and difficult role. It reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider, but the role here is much more demanding, as she has to play a child prostitute. It is likely that she wins numerous awards. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl who was sold into prostitution by her family and kept as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. She meets an American (played by Ron Livingston in a strong dramatic role that we are not used to seeing him), who after spending some time with her decides to help her. At that time, however, she sells herself again and he goes to look for her in Cambodia. The story turns and turns and the audience can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The performance was solid in all areas with a very interesting international cast. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex tourist), Virgine Ledoyen (playing as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his last films). The Asian cast was also excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult subject, it focuses successfully on telling a compelling and powerful story. It was filmed in Cambodia (some scenes in real brothels) which increases the feeling that you are almost watching a documentary. It seems that the DP used many handheld cameras and close-ups and, in general, made you feel like you were there as part of the story. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I heard other members of the audience when they left and it seemed that everyone was stunned. This is not an easy movie to watch and I greet the filmmakers for not doing a "Hollywood movie". <br /> <br /> It's by far the best movie I've seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Opinion shared by my husband and a couple of other friends.
