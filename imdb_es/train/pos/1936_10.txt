There are many fantastic things about the film that the cast and the team that I had the opportunity to The encounter was absolutely phenomenal. I thought Avi did a great job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely faithful to his role for a Disney actor. I was surprised by his talent to be able to move from a teenage comedy to such an adult role without any problem. The talent in the movie was simply amazing. you want to see an independent movie, this is a reality that you should see. I think Mr. Gruver would have been so proud to have such a presentation at his festival and that his parents loved the movie when he won the audience favorite. And I saw it again. This was really a great movie. It was dark, funny, sad and truly emotional. It was fabulous Honestly, I'm so excited about this movie and I really do not want to spoil it for anyone, just watch it and really surprise me, I think these filmmakers really have what it takes to go places and I hope to see them. More work from them in the future.
