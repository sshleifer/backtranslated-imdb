THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous work about a television journalist named Felix Unger, who is an obsessive fanatic, moving in with his divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, a complete sports journalist and villain, as his wife. Frances kicks him out of his apartment. Already divorced, Oscar receives his best friend and regrets it from the moment he does it. The classic comedy of Neil Simon arrived for the first time at Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau to Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes over Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny on paper, it is so vividly real that it brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger. Matthau, fortunately, was able to recreate his role as Oscar, a unique comic gem that provides consistent laughter at all times. This team of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be a comic gold that was revisited in nine other films. With these two actors who are no longer with us, the visualization of this classic becomes more moving but no less hilarious. Simon's game has been extended very well for the screen with a silent prologue that recounts a suicide attempt of Felix Depressed who is a winner. The cast includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as poker partners for Oscar and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon sisters, blind dates for Oscar and Felix. Of course, it later became an excellent television series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there's nothing like the original. A joy from beginning to end.
