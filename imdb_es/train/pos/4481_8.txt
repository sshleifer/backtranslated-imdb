The only reason I give this film 8/10 stars, and not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is horrible and 2) the love interest of the character of Kelly leaves much to be desired, (IMHO). Love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is the little boy. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my personal favorites and my daughter's. I am 28 years old and she is 4 years old, so although the character is less iconic than Mickey, she is still the favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is as always captivating, her eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've seen him in, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the twentieth century. No wonder Paula Abdul "sampled" Kelly's movements. I would also mention Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you only saw one part, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
