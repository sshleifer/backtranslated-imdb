['The premise is simple. This movie begins as a movie of average lame girls on two attractive young people who are in an airport, then things take a 180 degree turn ... <br /><br /> For my part, I really dislike the kind of nonsense that stuns the love story that pollutes the average cinema. And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven, based on his previous meta-horror films (Sceam) also does it ... <br /><br /> Following this logic, it is not surprising to find that Craven takes his time sardonically to build a nauseatingly sweet &quot;seduction story&quot;, only to have an AWESOME accident of Cillian Murphy in a dream world covered in sugar ... <br /><br /> The scope of his character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper, do you understand, lame, right?) In this film is impressive, it goes from being absolutely charming to being a sickly twisted nihilist, which is an advantage in my book. As you go to scare your victim (by the way, Jennifer Garner looks like Rachel McAdams, whom I found quite annoying), you can not help but sympathize with the boy ... <br /><br /> This is Wes Craven, played in Jackson Ripner, through Cillian Murphy, hitting all the movies of brainless girls ... <br /><br /> Mr. Craven, I greet you. <br /><br /> Best appointment: <br /><br /> Jackson Ripner (after beating Rachel McAdams in the plane bathroom): &quot;Thanks for the speed!&quot;']
