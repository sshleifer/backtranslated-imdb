Have you ever wondered where the ideas for romantic novels and other published articles come from? According to 'Jake Speed', they are based on real people, living the adventures they write and publish. This film is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence, and scant clothing in the worst case. Language is not a problem either, and jokes are fun at all levels. This is a look from 'Austin Powers' to 'Indian Jones', without the antics of Michael Myers. I recommend this movie for children in the range of 10 to 15.
