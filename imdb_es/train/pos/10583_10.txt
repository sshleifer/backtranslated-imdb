The fall of the Stock Exchange of 1929 and the Depression that followed almost ruined the American Musical Theater, in fact, was the final death blow for vaudeville. Those behind the curtains were beaten as badly as those in the front. <br /> <br /> In an effort to stimulate business economics and his own personal economy, theater director James Cagney has a brilliant idea. Make relevant prologues live of the films that are projected in the different cinemas that arise from the old theaters. Some other competitors realize and the competition is under way. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite movie of Busby Berkeley. It gives James Cagney the opportunity to show some of his versatility as a dancer and as a tough guy. In his retirement, Cagney said that while he projected his few and far between musicals, he could barely bother with some of his dramatic films. I wished I had done some more musicals in his career and I wish I had done it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the staging of these Busby Berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies logic and reason. But it's so creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell sings three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is Here, Honeymoon Hotel and By a Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler further consolidating the screen team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two and she partners with James Cagney in my favorite Footlight Parade number, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is a sensible girl from Cagney on Friday at the theater. As in Blonde Crazy, she is the one with the real brains in that duo and it is her quick thinking that frees her from some domestic problems she has besides the theatrical ones. One of the best roles of Blondell on the screen. <br /> <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the chorus according to the IMDb pages of both. John Garfield is briefly seen in the Shanghai Lil number. And in a scene at the beginning of the film, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater where they show a western B starring John Wayne. The duke's voice is unmistakable. But what's even more unusual is that the short clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh, who plays another Cagney assistant in Footlight Parade. I think the Warner brothers were playing a little joke there. I have to believe that the clip was deliberate. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at its best surreal moment.
