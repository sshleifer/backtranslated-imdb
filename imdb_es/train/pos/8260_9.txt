Those Frenchmen and those Germans have a long history of not liking each other. It is interesting to note that the translation of Kamerdaschaft or camaraderie takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would besiege Germany and begin his plans to conquer the world, France being a victim of his ambitions. But these are times of serenity compared to the future. A group of miners on the border tries to cross into France to get a job. They are rejected and later in a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster occurs in the mines of the French and in a well elaborated and written scene, a group of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story, is not it? Pabst was a silent film poet and I'm not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is yet to be discovered. He is not fussy but he brings realism resistant to the test. There is even a flashback of a World War II event that marks the point of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the film makes events with pride with frankness and terseness. Smetimes, that's what a movie should be.
