It came by surprise. . The impact and resolution that this film had in my automatic way of reacting to people and situations. Most vividly was the agitation of the emotion of anger. Like the way a spoiled child would be when he reacts to not getting what they want. . A tantrum if you want. To think that he was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. What was this costing me? So much love. . .sooo many blessings. Now I am aware of how incredible it feels to humble myself and to have a constant attitude of gratitude for life. . For what is happening at the moment, without my wild expectations that life is a particular way, the way I think life or people "should" be. This film has contributed to the freedom I now feel to connect with others, without limits or expectations. . .and connect with genuine love. . .without fear of loss. . Only to love first and accept what is given.
