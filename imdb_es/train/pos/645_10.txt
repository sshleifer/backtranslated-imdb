I hate French films that are too long, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and most talented French film of all. I saw it twice in the mid-70s, and then it disappeared. But finally I was able to see him again in 1999, and I fell in love again. The most remarkable thing is that today it feels as fresh as 25 years ago. If you have not seen it, do not miss the opportunity!
