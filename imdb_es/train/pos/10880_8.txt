['It is not the worst movie ever made, the actors are not horrified and the script and the director are not completely inept. <br /><br /> It is not the best film ever made, the actors are not excellent and the script and the director are not entirely brilliant. <br /><br /> It falls somewhere in the middle. A fun somewhere. A nice place, well built somewhere. <br /><br /> There is no need to say &quot;do not take it seriously&quot; or &quot;so bad that it&#39;s good&quot; or &quot;it was not scary&quot;. None of these comments is relevant. <br /><br /> The cut has an atmosphere. It is that environment that is really unique, and the really original aspect of the film, which personally is what the film does for me.']
