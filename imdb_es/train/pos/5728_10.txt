I went to this movie waiting for a film of artistic fear. What I got was fear after fear. It's a horror movie at its core. It's not as boring as other horror movies where a haunted house only has ghosts and gore. This movie does not even show you most of the deaths, it shows the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept is that it's not just the house that torments who enters the house. They obsess no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms, etc. After reading some of the external criticism, I am surprised that the critics did not like this movie. I'm going to see him again this week and I'm excited. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars because it did what a horror movie should do. It scared me a lot.
