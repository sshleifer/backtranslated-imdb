I read most of the comments posted here and all I can say is that most of these posters have major problems in life. This show, unlike most games, was fun. Mr. Shatner, whose brilliance in EVERYTHING he does, was once again the success of the show. His genuinely bubbly personality shines like a beacon wherever he goes. It's fun and it makes you smile and that's exactly what the show does as well. The dancers and the questions, the circular fashion that they present only add to the attraction of the show. And although there is a lot of money at stake, it's fun. The pressure (stress) that exists in most game programs does NOT exist here. Several people who posted messages complained about the lack of time with dancers and choosing questions, etc., as Millionaire does not have similar time losses. All I can say is that most of you have missed the whole concept. The idea here is to have fun and ENJOY. There is something for everyone. Questions to test your knowledge, sweet eyes (the dancers), suspense, the wonderful funny personality of Mr. Shatner ... well, if that does not encourage the boys, then I feel bad for you. And if that is not enough, YOU CAN BE RICH! I really miss the show. Of ALL the games programs I've been in, and to be frank, I hate games, this is the one I really liked and really weird. The only other game program that I liked was Match Game.
