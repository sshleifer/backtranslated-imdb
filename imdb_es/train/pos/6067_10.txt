Although I am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie, I am ashamed to say that I like it a lot. Not often can you find a huge stack of 80s papers out of a Wham! video, so it's definitely worth seeing (Â£ 0.79 per night at my local store!). Beware of the incredibly obvious seams and zipper of the monster's disguise, the fact that the 'hero' looks a lot like Keith Chegwin and lines as classic as the following: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "At last we find Kor. .. "Kor:" Exciting, is not it? "<br /> <br /> Incredible! I also like the fact that, although the video frame seems quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by furious seas and a dangerous hawk ... like a bird carrying a handsome hero to safety (among other interesting and attractive suggestions) of what happens in the film itself, none of them really happens No, I'm not joking ... there really is not a sea fury or a fierce bird, just try to make you interested ... classic in my opinion. This movie gets 10 for pure entertainment value!
