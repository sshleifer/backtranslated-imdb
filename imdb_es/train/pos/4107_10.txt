I really liked that movie! It's really weird, extremely funny, morbid, witty ... It does not make sense to talk about the content of the movie, because then it would be giving the result! You have to see it without knowing what it is about! Everything is connected and has its why and why. It begins subtly and then things start rolling faster and faster until they culminate in the most demented outburst you can imagine. It's even more fun to watch the movie the second time, once you know all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a true masterpiece! I recommend this movie, it's one of the most original I've seen!
