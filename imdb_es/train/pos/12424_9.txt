I always wanted David Duchovney to enter the film business, and finally he did, and I was proud. This film lived up to what I had expected. Duchovney played his character very well, managing to remain consistent with something new, instead of playing Agent Molder to which we are accustomed. Therefore, I give him additional credit for his role, also because he could not see anyone else playing that particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that you do not get tired of throughout the movie, because it never ceases to amaze you. It has strengths and weaknesses, which makes the story even more credible. I also enjoyed the narrative a lot, joined the story and had some memorable quotes that I still use all the time. This movie also had a wounderfull score. I recommend this to anyone who likes drama, and does not care about blood.
