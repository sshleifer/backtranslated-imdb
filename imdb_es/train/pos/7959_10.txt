This is a really great movie! I remember seeing it for the first time when I was very young and I used to see it all the time once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really fun and it's great how they train animals to do all those things. However, some parts of the film are sad (like when Sassy, ​​the cat, falls down the waterfall, and when Shadow falls into the hole at the end.) I've seen the second Homeward Bound but I have to say it's not as good as the first. Shadow is the smart one, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​and Chance is the funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies or talking animals. This is one of my ten favorite movies!
