YOU MUST SEE IT! I saw WHIPPED at a press screening and it was hilarious. We are talking about non-stop laughter. It makes SOMETHING ABOUT MARY look like a sinuous drama. Amanda Peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty, intelligence and serious acting ability. Peter Cohen, the director, has made a cutting-edge film that shows the rawness of men's egos in the world of urban dating. For all his comedy, Whipped triumphs with his intelligence. Which is very rare for a director for the first time, especially with a romantic comedy. He is a great talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber complete the cast with a deep and very strong interpretation, as they would be Lady Slick's men. You have to see these guys go to work and get trapped in Peet's network. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, it's worth the 3 minute download.
