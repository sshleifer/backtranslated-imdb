The Hanson brothers: Andy (apparently has his act together) and Hank (clearly does not have his act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get some mass that will have consequences for the entire Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This movie is valid. This is a layered, full-blood roller coaster that knows exactly what it is doing. As a criminal drama / thriller, I would happily compare it to 'It's not country for old people'. While both films have a wide range of dramas and emotions of characters, 'Devil' is more on the side of the thriller because of its fast pace. 'No Country' is a colder and gloomy film that you can really admire, while 'Devil' is a bit more pleasant. There is definitely less violence in "Diablo" than in "No Pa√≠s". The performance is also delivered. Ethan Hawke, sometimes of wood in the past, brings the anxieties, sweat and stare of the deer in the headlights to the beleaguered Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, has the most difficult scenes in the film and is quickly becoming the actor, who you think can do anything. <br /> <br /> There really is not much problem with this movie. Jump from one side to the other without being confused. The events get out of control, but the film never does: the writing (of the first accountant Kelly Masterson), the direction (the veteran Sidney Lumet) and the editing remain as tight as a drum. In many categories, it is award-winning material, although perhaps films like 'The Departed' and 'No Country' brought it out into the open. If you liked those, you'll like this.
