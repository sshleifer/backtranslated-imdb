This movie is a movie that must be seen for everyone. Congress should see this truthful documentary from the point of view of the soldier, as well as everyone in the United States. The previous critic did not understand the point: the point is to reveal the truth about how to teach our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists, but who only live in the territory of our "enemy", and what this does to soldiers . We must support our troops by taking them home IMMEDIATELY, before another person dies or is injured. This also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who suffer mental injuries, with post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd, or physically, with lost members. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
