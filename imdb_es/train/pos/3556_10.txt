Oh, this is such a glorious musical. There is a bit of miscasting: Frank Sinatra is as bad as the Jew Nathan Detroit, although it only becomes evident in "Sue Me", which is a clearly Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs of the program, "Marry the Man Today", and replaced it with a lower part of Sinatra. With these two flaws in mind, the movie is magnificent. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing beans that are worthwhile, but he still takes them out anyway. Stubby Kaye beautifully repeats her role on Broadway (it was written for him). The language and rhythm and humor of Damon Runyon are quite good. This is on my list to see and get every opportunity.
