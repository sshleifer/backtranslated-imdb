I thought the children in the movie were great. I deal with children in that age group, and I thought their behaviors were very credible. I had a problem with the reference to private parties made by the 5 year old child. I did not think the comment was necessary and I actually lowered my opinion about the film a bit. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is a promising star. I would like to see more of him on the big screen. I enjoyed his reactions to the situations he was in. Often, children in this age group do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all the actors did this throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I also believe that the message of bullying should be examined more in films with this age group. It is a major problem in today's schools. <br /> <br /> The ending was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts on whether or not he won the bet were very surprising. How he handled that situation was excellent. Very often today's children are not willing to compromise. The actors in this film showed that commitment is an important part of life.
