My sister and I rented this movie because we were in the mood for something of poor quality and not so demanding to see. However, the film far exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> It is much more than a representation of a century. It has very real representations of the characters within it and most of the actors do an incredible job. The different stories are cooked with real images of the moment that give it a unique touch. As I watched him, I felt that I cared what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would also like to congratulate Julia Stiles for her performance of Katie, she was great in a way that She stood out! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone ...
