I've always been a big fan of this movie, first of all you've seen the cast, the acting is excellent and it helps to make this movie go very well. Cybill Shepherd received rave reviews for his role and they were well deserved. The beginning of this film begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect marriage suddenly stops when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Louse receives a second chance in life when he agrees to be "recycled" to earth as the newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues to live his new life forgetting his past life, while Corinne tries to continue with hers. But fate crosses Alex's path 23 years later when he meets Corinne's daughter, Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and suddenly fills with unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins, and embarrassing situations occur). The music is excellent and the scenes feel the heart and very cute. You will not be disappointed if you give it a chance, chances are you like it. Very funny and sweet!
