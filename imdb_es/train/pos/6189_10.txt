Who would have imagined it: Hal Hartley creates a film corollary for Syriana while retaining his characteristic idiosyncratic style. The fusion is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Having not seen a Hal Hartley movie for a decade, I approached it with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties impressed critics and audiences with his unique style and dialogue. The director's previous films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life, often in the Long Island region, New York, or in New York City itself, which were unconventional and insightful. <br /> <br /> My initial precaution derived from the description of this film as a "spy thriller". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to unite his well-established style and approach to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than one could imagine. Hartley's film retains the focus of dialogue and character that are its trademarks, along with a unique cinematographic style. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is very appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by Dark Elements on all sides. Hartley has taken all his skills to something new: a political film worth mentioning at the same time as Syriana. Truly he is coming to his own. The cast does a good job in interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey fans will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more mature and beautiful than before.
