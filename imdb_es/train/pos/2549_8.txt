The wonderfully urban Ronald Coleman is presented here as in many other of his films. It's literally in every scene and this comic movie stays fresh thanks to him, not in spite of him. He is handsome, witty and very intelligent here, as he stays one step ahead of his charming and wandering wife, perfectly interpreted by Anna Lee. The film is based on a French play and brings all the best qualities of that farce. Most of the cast is well known, at least on the face if you do not name ... and are absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable, as he stays one step ahead of the other characters. His multiple talents can be appreciated even more in the classic "Lost Horizon" that all moviegoers must see.
