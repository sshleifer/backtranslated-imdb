"Happenstance" is the most New York Parisian film I've seen since "When the Cat's Away (Chacun cherche are chat)". <br /> <br /> A movie from last year released to capitalize on attention. Audrey Tatou obtains by "Amelie", its title in French is more appropriate: "Le Battement d'ailes du papillon (The Striking of the Wings of Butterfly)" to summarize the theory of chaos as a controlling element in our lives. <br /> <br /> Tatou's gameplay is less annoying here because he only occasionally shows that dazzling smile in the midst of his unfortunate adventures, and because he is part of a large multi-ethnic group, so big that it took me a long time to solve it. the characters, especially when some of the cute guys and older women looked like me, and some of the characters fantasize about what they should do, so I was not sure if they were doing that or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved how urban the coincidences were, from immigrants to nests and subway cars full of people to cafes. <br /> <br /> The subtitles made both parts of a dialogue quite irritating at one time. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 8/12/2001)
