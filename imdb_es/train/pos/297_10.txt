I am glad that other people have enjoyed this movie, because I know that it does not have the best reputation and that it did not win money at the box office. I thought it was fantastic and there are several reasons why: Bogdanovich heads with the lightest touches, the cast (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect and Big Big Apple never looked better in the film. You've seen worse movies!
