I was watching this when my wife called to ask from the other room about my rate of choice. My comment? "I'm watching my life!" <br /> <br /> Although younger, but only about 5 years old or so, than the "Rocket Boys", I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was received by our education administrators and how the whole Fair business of Science gained momentum and brought me and others into the competitive whirlwind. My own tornado landed me at the Science Fair in my own state, in Physics in '62, although our group was less successful in obtaining the support of, for example, firefighters to whom we went for guidance and advice until, After a tragic event, our city was so up to the moment to allow us to tour the site of Nike missiles on the shore of Lake Chicago. <br /> <br /> This movie gave it back to me and I'll bet you gave it back to a group of us "UberNerds" from the late 50's and early 60's. <br /> <br / > We are in a similar period of draining science now and we really need this film as a country. Look at it!
