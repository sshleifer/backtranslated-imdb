I went to see this movie waiting for a nice and relaxing moment in the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I had to really control myself to convince her that I was not afraid. In many ways, it's still a story for children, but with a script that has great potential. It could have been one of the most terrifying movies if it had been planned for another audience.
