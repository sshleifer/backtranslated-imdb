This is one of those rare movies, it's charming and compelling, dignified and peculiar, a true gift. I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or any vacation, because it reminds you that you open yourself to a wider experience (yes, find magic). I especially loved Josie Lawrence, as Lottie Wilkins, but every lead actor and supporting actor is impeccable in this movie. In addition, the costumes, if you are attracted to fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well made. I wish it was released on DVD because I'm running out of tape! <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth your time, just make sure you settle in to see it, without interruptions.
