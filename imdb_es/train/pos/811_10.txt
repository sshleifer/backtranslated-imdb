When I think of Return of the Jedi, I think of epic. Yes, the Ewoks were there, so what? They are an interesting complement to the film (not to mention that they are similar to the Vietcong that could also bring down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (played by the amazing theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so evil and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what an incredible ending for such an iconic character. Vader is truly a modern Greek tragedy and I believe that people can now understand and appreciate this especially after The Revenge of the Sith came out. His redemption at the end was touching and it really brings you a happy but bittersweet feeling. The best part was, of course, the special effects. It's amazing how an early eighties movie can stand the test of time with its graphics. The scenes in Jabba's palace (Leia looks amazing in that metal bikini) and, of course, the epic three-way battle at the end are still impressive. In all the deep plot and emotional moments of Jedi (mainly between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and incredible special effects is an appropriate end to one of the most beloved franchises in the history of cinema.
