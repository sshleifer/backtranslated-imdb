I had no idea what this movie was until I read it in the L.A. Weekly Generally, I agree with the reviews in LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this movie. Movie stars Molly Parker (from my favorite television show, Deadwood) and Lukas Haas, whom I suspect we will see more in the very near future. The film is funny, moving, presents a great performance and a beautiful picture. I do not know if the film has distribution, but I hope that it has it, or has it, soon. This is meant to be a true indie gem. It even has music from my favorite band the Silver Jews! The only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not there at the screening. Even without her there ... this was unquestionably the best movie I saw at the festival.
