As a person who has seen and followed Hartley's public works for several years, I believe that much of what used to be fiction told through real stories has become a dark mental mental game. <br /> <br /> Although entertaining, Fay Grim is another Step in the line of thought of Henry Fool, where the film reflects the quality of an object within the same film. In Henry Fool, the object is memories ... In Fay Grim, the object is encrypted memories, which in turn are stolen, forged and transformed into something so dark that it really does not make sense, that is, the script process. and making movies in the modern era, where most of the highly successful films are little more than a mix of the past. That is, in a philosophical sense, what Fay Grim is about. The object, perhaps, is the tragedy that the shock is now clich√© and boring (as implied in the opening scenes in the editors' office). <br /> <br /> That said, many of the best points of the film are lost if I do not understand Henry's character and the meaning of the memories that are sought. Henry is a little veiled demon, first he visits Simon as a modern Faustus, etc. Without understanding how tragic Henry's character is, much of the quality of the plot and the story of Fay Grim is lost. <br /> <br /> And there is not enough "detail" expressed through verbal flashbacks: knowing the plot of Henry Fool can not be compared to "feeling" the quality of the characters as one did in Henry Fool, and I think that for someone who enters this movie, it's like 10 minutes. of 'and what?' Answers to highly constructed dialogues and that's it. <br /> <br /> However, Henry Fool was also my least favorite Hartley movie until I realized that it was bad - putrid and infested - precisely because Henry Fool's confessions were bad ... not only rude or dirty, but inevitably broken. Henry can not even be a proper villain, and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him more attractive ... like Gollum in Tolkien's works, Henry is pitiful. <br /> <br /> That does not appear in Fay Sinister, although Henry's dialogue is excellent. What does happen is that the whole movie is built like an encryption, a kind of mold of another plot around what ends up being another bad story to add to Henry's confessions. It's an interesting turn, but one that really can not be digested without seeing the first movie. Maybe having shown Henry more before would have been better than having the editor describe the basic story of the first movie, although this plot is not really what the first movie was about either, unless perhaps one is a casual observer. . <br /> <br /> Part of the encryption? Hard to say ... although a little disappointed with the sexual tricks. Cheesy.
