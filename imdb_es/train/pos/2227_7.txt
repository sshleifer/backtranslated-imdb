This will have reviews throughout the map because it does not fit any mold comfortably. It's horror ... but it's not a feast. It is just as suspense and horror, but without the screams of Hollywood and the abrupt camera. <br /> <br /> The sensation of the film is scarce and without special effects, because I think you should listen and look at the faces of the characters. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a Buffy universe graduate. That is a false trail. He is acting here. 'Camp' is a misinterpretation of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau is giving a solid performance, so she must believe that the script has something to say. We all know the regrettable excuses where the actors simply do not care anymore and we're just waiting for the director to make a "cut" and receive his paychecks. This is not the case, here. <br /> <br /> Forgive the fact that bodies begin to fall with an almost mondo-fun regularity. I do not think the intention was comical, but to keep you out of balance. <br /> <br /> Think of it less in a 'Film' of Terror and more in a 'Work' of Terror in a scenario: that decrepit whitewashed house. Then you could see that it really is about paranoia, fear and spiral madness in an isolated place, EE. UU <br /> <br /> And it's twisted. Travel in time, mind control, secret experiments and those of Nazi that CAN NOT be dead. . .yet. <br /> <br /> I say rent it and try it out if you're in the mood for something a bit cerebral. This would be a good option for a Saturday at midnight.
