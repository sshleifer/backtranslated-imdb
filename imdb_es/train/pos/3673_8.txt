In 2004 I saw "True", Tom Tykwer's contribution to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it I loved it and I got excited. It became my favorite short film and it made me appreciate both the format. Of course I wanted to see the whole movie, and I would even check who was attached, etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw it, courtesy of the Internet. <br /> <br /> First of All I have to say is that it looks AWESOME. The photography is BEAUTIFUL in all the shorts and shots, in the worst case it is nothing special, but it is still bright and clear. Later, I read the triviality here, and maybe it's how the 6K scan gives more justice to all the PD work. My special favorites are the first scene "Quais de Seine" (that sunlight!), Sin City-esquire (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine", and "14th Arrondisement", but you know, what the hell like all: "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still make me nervous with those bright colors (my eyes are shaking!) and "Quartier Latin" is gold engraved in silver. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some BEAUTIFUL short films. <br /> <br /> Now let's see the content. I really like (and I mean a LOT) the eclecticism that feels so successful. You never have the same themes or treatments between two shorts, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to allow all of these artists to explore beautiful and deep things within the shorts. I loved moving from a simple love story to a Chinese musical madness in Paris with Barbet Schroeder in a social commentary about a horror comedy in a humble monologue. I love surprises! And this movie has them! It's great that they had the opportunity to let all these directors do things that are not usual in conventional film (which I have come to despise to a great extent). It's not very experimental, but I can breathe the breathing space that these people had. <br /> <br /> I like the little time and I love acting. I love simplicity and love love. I like simple feelings and beauty and eclecticism and in general it is a movie that is very nice to watch, alone or with someone. To simply feel. It left me feeling very good. <br /> <br /> There's something about how serious it is ... it's so frank ... <br /> <br /> What did I not like? Well, for me there are two shorts that are not exactly the best: "Quais de Seine" (which is good, safe, and maybe even necessary, but looks too much like a commercial?) And "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" that Although I love acting, I felt that their songs were forced. But that, of course, is me. "Tour Eiffel" I did not love either, but I think it's probably due to my sensitivity very different from that of Sylvain Chomet. I do not know if this movie has a special interest for people who already know the actor and the directors, so they can delight in their interaction, in the surprises (look for Alexander Payne in a funny role) and, basically, in "what " Will this director do with this? Great question I really enjoyed it that way. <br /> <br /> I repeat now: most of the shorts that I loved and all together form a beautiful and energetic mix. I definitely recommend it. Insurance!!! So, see if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!
