A fantastic Arab adventure. A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus) seek Ahmad's love interest, which was stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is hardly a bad moment here. It's always inventing new adventures for the heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a little bored (no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is in fourth place in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a funny actor, is a great villain, and Sabu is very funny as the prince of thieves, who at some point finds a genie in a bottle. He also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the father of the princess. Collect incredible toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him by his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. This would probably count as one of the best movies for children of all time, but special effects have a horrible date today. Children will surely make fun of the superimposed images when Abu and the genius are together on the screen. And the scene with the giant spider looks especially horrible. Although most younger generations probably think that King Kong looks bad at the moment, Willis O'Brien's motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that does not even look like a spider. 8/10.
