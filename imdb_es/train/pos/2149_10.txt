['Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, are people we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama&#39;s transformation is incredibly believable. The score is so moving, it made me cry. The choreography was beautiful without looking athletic. The elegant dance and the charm of Mai gave me goose bumps. Tamako is a wonderfully charming character. You can almost see the enchanted schoolgirl on her face when she remembers seeing &quot;The King and I&quot;. The character of Aoki is both hilarious and pitiful. Masako is as overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife, who almost wants to hug her to assure her that everything will be fine. <br /><br /> This movie is truly a guardian.']
