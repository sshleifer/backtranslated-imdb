Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code movie starring some of the best of the time. It is found in the maternity ward of a hospital, especially in the ward for women who are expected to have problems. In it there is an older woman, a single hard mother (Glenda Farrell), a frail young woman, an Italian woman and the main character (Loretta Young) who spends 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second hoping to know that everything will be fine. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is excellent at her job. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and entertaining. It is not terribly shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such a careless subject on the silver screen. The acting is brilliant everywhere. Loretta Young is beautiful here at her best. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is as honest as he can be. Her innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great as always, a staple of precodes and for good reason.
