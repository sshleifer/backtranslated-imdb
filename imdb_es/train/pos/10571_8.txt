['James Cagney is best known for his tough characters and gangster roles, but he has also played many &quot;soft&quot; characters in his career. This musical is one of them and was the first, but not the last musical film that Cagney starred in. <br /><br /> Cagney even sings a bit in this and also dances a lot. And it must be said that he was not bad at that. He plays the role with great confidence. Apparently, he had some dance work in his early life before his acting career began to take off, so it&#39;s really not a strange thing that he has also assumed some musical actor roles in his career. Obviously, he also feels comfortable in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing. <br /><br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who was perhaps one of the best and most successful directors in the genre. His first musicals of the 30s defined the musical genre and was also responsible for genre films such as &quot;42nd Street&quot;. His musicals were always light and funny to watch and more comedies than anything else really. The musicals of the &#39;30s were never really about their singing, this was something that was most present in the musicals of the&#39; 40s and later, mainly from the MGM studios. <br /><br /> As usual, it has a light and simple story, set in the musical world, which, of course, is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way. However, it&#39;s a fun and simple story that also makes it an entertaining movie to watch. So do the characters and actors who portray them. Although it is strange that the total plot line of the film is abandoned towards the end of the film, when the film only begins with routines of musical numbers. <br /><br /> The musical moments towards the end of the film are also fun and well done, although I am not too much of a fan of the genre itself. Once again, the musical numbers also have a young Billy Barty. he often played small children / babies / mice and whatever earlier in his career, including the musical film &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, one year earlier. <br /><br /> An early genre movie recommended. <br /><br /> 8/10']
