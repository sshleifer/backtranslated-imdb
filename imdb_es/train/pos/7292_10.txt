I saw this last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival at Laemlee's on Beverly. This movie received the highest applause of all the movies that night. Considering that two music videos were opened first, I did not know what to expect since they were very fast and flashy, I was not sure I was ready for a short film immediately. But to my surprise I really enjoyed this. I thought that the main actor was a very good demon. I was so impressed with his performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that this was the type of Witchblade. It has become really good especially since then! Either that, either they gave him terrible roles or the director pushed him very hard for this short film. The girl did a good job. I guess it's difficult since it was his first performance and being so young. Dad also did well. There was a lot of good CG work for a short, both for this and for the next "Mexican Hat", which was also good, but I enjoyed it more because it had more depth and emotion and I really cared about the characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was quite illustrative and dark! He treated real issues using a more fantasy approach to keep ADD people like me interested. We will not even talk about the last movie in the block that I left. My only complaint is that I only wish I had seen more of the demon character and a little less of having started, so I gave it a 9 out of 10. I also thought that the final credits were a bit slower. Otherwise, it was beautifully said, directed and edited. The moment was very pleasant with a complete change of the fast MTV edition made in everything today. There will be more of this director in the future, as well as the actor. Now I will think of him as the actor of the Lost Dolores, not the Witchblade boy.
