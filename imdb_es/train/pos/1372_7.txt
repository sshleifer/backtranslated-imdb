"Party Girl" capitalizes on the tremendous charm of Parker Posey. In fact, sometimes, the film seems to be a vehicle in which Ms. Posey can interpret herself, as is usually the case in real life. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a gift to the fans of Ms. Posey. Mrs. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild trip to lower Manhattan to show us this soul aimlessly whose life is dedicated to having fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents. This is an era that was still more naive than what became that area and the adjacent districts of the Meat Market. At least, there are no pretensions in the movies and we see people going to their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that way. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. It's because of Parker Posey that we enjoy the movie more than if another actress had played Mary. She is the complete image. The rest of the cast is good.
