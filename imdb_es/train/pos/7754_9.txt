Any Way the Wind Blows is Tom Barmans (who is also known as the leader of the rock band 'dEUS') in the debut film. Filmed entirely in Antwerp (Belgium), the film begins on Friday morning and skips in a very superficial way between the events that fill the day of a dozen main characters. When the movie ends, you have many things to think about, because most of the different lines of the story are open. <br /> <br /> The movie has a sound track (purely instrumental) that will make you vibrate. socks outside. In most of the scenes, the music really improves the atmosphere and the general feeling, making the movie amazing to watch at certain moments of time. The main scene of the film, the party, is very well filmed. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use video clip techniques, as his main characters danced on one of the best sound tracks I've ever heard. listened to lately. <br /> <br /> The script is a great thing. The angles and colors of the camera are very well chosen. The 'suits' are very hot and very 'seventy' too. And I loved (most of) the acting. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the film are the subtle touches of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that intertwine. <br /> <Without pretending to be a comedy (this film is certainly not a comedy but an alternative work of art), it still manages to make its audience laugh and even laugh sometimes. <br /> <br /> This is a director's debut that should not be an end. I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I had a good time. Cheers.
