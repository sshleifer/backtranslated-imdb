One of the best cult classics of producer Roger Corman was the Ramones vehicle (originally designated for Cheap Trick), Rock N 'Roll High School. It's just a story, technically outdated (but it would serve extra dose of nostalgic humor considering these were the things that made Napoleon Dynamite's characters fun - see the Eaglebauer truck) about teenagers who love rock n 'roll. <br /> <br /> Students at Vince Lombardi High School encounter the resilience of the evil director, Miss Evelyn Togar (played by classic cult favorite Mary Woronov) who fears Rock N 'Roll will turn the children in loving and uncontrollable eaters. A free zone of Rock N 'Roll. In fact, he intends to eliminate Rock N 'Roll for all students, regardless of whether he is in school, and has the cooperation of most adults who could make the plan successful. <br /> <br /> But not if Riff Randell (PJ Soles) can help him. A Ramones fan, she has written some songs (including Rock N 'Roll High School) that she wants to give to the Ramones, and in trying to do so, she is rejected by Ms. Togar who does everything possible to keep her from going to See the ramones play in the city. It culminates in a definitive revolt between the obsolete adults who hate fun and teenagers (in an ending reminiscent of Over the Edge, somehow). After the years of punk, when the fame of garage rockers, The Ramones (and others) marked another change in the evolution of music, it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of all this and in such a humorous way and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> It's mostly soft comedy, but a great comedy to feel good, however, when you're in the mood for something more relaxed to entertain you. With Jerry Zucker (of airplane fame) and Joe Dante (of the Gremlins fame) participating in the direction, you can get an idea of ​​the kind of humor you have (and not to mention, wait to see Dick Miller, though just for a few minutes at the end of the movie). The story must have been inspired later (and, therefore, updated) by the mid-90s comedy, Detroit Rock City, that some minor character changes in the vehicle for older glam rockers, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I would recommend transmitting the Corey Feldman vehicle, Rock N 'Roll High School Forever, launched almost a decade later. The original is still the best.
