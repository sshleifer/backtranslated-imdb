Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives it to him every time he's on stage. Whether we are laughing at their jokes and pranks or wiping our eyes with one of her tremendous ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can not see it live (which is the best way to see Bette), then this is the best option. One interesting thing to consider is how amazing his voice has changed and matured over the years, but he never lost his power. His most "vocally correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses anything in the spirit of THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS. Here he is purer and more sincere than ever. I will treasure this concert for a long time.
