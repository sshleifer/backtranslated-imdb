The Rookie is based on the true story of a school teacher over 40 in Big Lake, Texas, who reaches the majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a science teacher and a baseball coach at a small town high school. His team is losing terribly until the team discovers that their coach played in the minor leagues and can throw a pitch at 98 mph. <br /> <br /> After launching the batting practice and making a bet, Jim agrees that if his team wins the regionals, he will try in the big leagues. The film tells the story of Jimmy being a boy to play in his first game in the majors. It's a great story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the film worthwhile, gives an emotional performance and has the support of an excellent cast that includes Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes a while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow, but in the end everything works fine. The baseball scenes are fun, well filmed and excellently represented. The movie really is not about baseball but about the search for a man to achieve his dream. It is inspiring, emotional and fun. I liked it, I hope you like it. <br /> <br /> The rookie. Protagonist: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
