This is an extremely powerful film based on a true story that can be irritating to watch. I say this because the brutal stalking press can be for the people, in this case an innocent Australian couple accused of killing their baby. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this movie came out. But I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's say both were excellent, but the role was a little harder for Streep because he had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned it so well that I had trouble understanding it in parts). <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything, all I can say is that this movie will exhaust you emotionally.
