"The Groove Tube" was initially shown on video, in the first "cinemas" here in Boston. In one room, there were television monitors in high places, with seats from old movie theaters, in small groups in front of the monitors. There were old refrigerators full of Pepsi, and baskets of York Peppermint Empanadas. In a second smaller room, there were no seats, only large pillows. That was the "smoking" room, that is, people used to take drugs there. That act only contributed to the hilarity of the video. <br /> <br /> I was a "frequent spectator"; The scenes that I liked the most and which I remember to this day are: Koko The Clown, The Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening), Safety Sam / VD PSA, the Chevy Chase hitchhiker with naked runs through the forest, Finger Ballet what finally revealed itself as the naked body of a woman. The last article is very reminiscent of the incredible Ernie Kovacs. Now, I have lost many readers under the age of 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs ??") but trust me, they are fun things. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why I was a "frequent spectator" was that I, and my friends, would bring other "Groove Tube" virgins to see it. We would sit down and look at the faces of the 'virgins' like the PSA of "Safety Sam". As the camera slowly approaches "Sam", we would wait for "OH!" Of recognition in the face of the 'virgin'. It was more fun than the previous one. And then that 'virgin' would bring a friend to see the show, repeating what we had done. To get this joke, you must see the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, part of it is outdated, but most of the plays, movies, television and now the videos. Just watch any video made in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I watched "The Groove Tube" in a movie theater, a grainy transfer of the original video. It had been cut, and some of the original high-point scenes were missing. <br /> <br /> The first "Saturday Night Live" show, with Chevy Chase, provoked instant commentary of "that's the kind of" The Groove Tube "", so it was a precursor to Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can not see a can of butter without listening to the voice-over ", cover your hands with a generous amount of Kramp Easy- Reduction of lubricants ..." and thinking about the recipe "Kramp Holiday Loaf " It always makes me laugh in the Needs aisle to bake at the grocery store. <br /> <br /> The early 70s were difficult times; "The Groove Tube" was fresh, new and really "got" the mood of the times. It offered a "hip generation", a humor that was not available in any other format / medium. MJH
