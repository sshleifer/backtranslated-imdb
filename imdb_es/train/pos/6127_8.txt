Jack Frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death. On the way to his death sentence, the truck of the prison in which he travels collides with a chemical tank filled with a chemist who turns his molecules with the snow on the ground turning him into a snowman. Being himself a murderer that would turn him into a murderous snowman. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him. Jack now begins his rampage again, killing people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I do not think Jack Frost has the chance to become a horror classic, but it's an entertaining movie. Just put your brain on hold and have fun with that, but do not take it too seriously.
