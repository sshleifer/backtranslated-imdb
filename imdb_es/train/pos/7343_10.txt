Why this movie has almost disappeared in the dark is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only Sword and Sorcery movie better. The brutal violence, the great designs of the characters and the good rhythm make this one of the best fantasies that exist. Without a doubt, it is the best animated film directed to a more adult audience than I have ever seen. This is not similar to Bakshi's usual frenetic style. It is a starting point for Bakshi, and in my opinion, his best work. I hope this film receives the recognition it deserves.
