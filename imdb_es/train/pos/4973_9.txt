I remember seeing this is your original broadcast in 1962 at five or six years old and REALLY enjoying this. I recently had the opportunity to see it again, for the first time since then, as it aired on "Walt Disney Presents" on the Disney Channel. I had forgotten most of it, and part of it was geared towards children, but it was still nice. I can not wait to show it to my niece and nephews.
