Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of the time, made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and everything that is precious in life. <br /> <br /> Currently, if people hear about it, they associate Marischka's name with the SISSI trilogy (1955, 1956, 1957). However, he made other excellent films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and, definitely, this, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN, which shows the young years of Queen Victoria. Although it is a slightly different subject than SISSI movies, I do not see much difference between this film and SISSI. They are surprisingly similar. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> The cast ... Romy Schneider is one of the first leading roles. It was a nice introduction to her role as Sissi since this film was made a year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian Empress. It is also a film where Romy plays with his mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director who chose Romy to play with his mother. Romy's debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) was also his performance with his mother. Therefore, there were some voices in which Romy began his Austrian career on the basis of his mother's fame. In fact, there is some truth in this. <br /> <br /> Again, as in SISSI, this movie shows love very gently. Victoria meets Prince Albert at a small inn in Dover. His sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and soft smiles. And now...? How would it show? Only sex ... But is it the only thing on which love is based? <br /> <br /> I thank Ernst Marischka for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people may call them kitsch, but I will never stop admiring these movies. They are impressive! Unfortunately, HIGHLY UNDERRADO!
