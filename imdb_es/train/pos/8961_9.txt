Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great phenomena of pop culture of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenomena we see today (in the 70s, more than ten years later, there were still endless references to this film). He made Novak a great star, put a good article on the resume of Jack Lemon, threw a new light on Jimmy Stewart and gave Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both continued to play witches and other onlookers) old bats ".", in film and television). <br /> <br /> Along with the movie of the 40s, I married a witch (who helped make Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the great fascination of film and television with everything that started with Bewitched and continued through Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> What I rarely see is that the The film is also a very interesting alternative to the Christmas movie, the story takes place during the Christmas holidays and, despite the fact that it is superficially witchcraft, it actually represents a lot of Christmas spirit (give, love, family, autosacrifici or, etc.). <br /> <br /> I will always watch this movie (I have seen it several times since the first time I saw it in the early 90s), especially if it is shown around or just after the season of holidays. It has style, substance, a great cast and excellent production values. And like Adam's Rib, he casually expresses ideas that were quite radical for his time, they are radical even now (in both films the female character is innocent and powerful), and that's why he always seems ahead of the times.
