I found myself at six and seven while I looked at this one. Altman's touch with the inside and outside approaches was there, and I expected those devices to comment on characters and situations. Unfortunately, from what I could see, they were sometimes gratuitous, sometimes witty, often sterile for not pointing out some ironic or other connection. In particular, two departures from the golden dome in the savanna simply perplexed. To be fair, however, a few approaches (outs and ins) to Branagh increased the growing bewilderment of his character, that of Pudgy McCabe or Philip Marlow. In general, the zooms were, well, inconsistent and, sometimes, even trite. <br /> <br /> Other soul devices, like the multiple glass panels between the camera and the subject, suggested the sollipsism or narcissism of the characters or opaque. states of knowledge. The windshields of the cars, the windows of the houses and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently, I felt, returning to THE PLAYER and even TO THE LONG GOOD CONDITION. A few sticky cuts, especially for a suggestive TV commercial, reminded me of such use in SHORT CUTS, with a sardonic effect. <br /> <br /> But, finally, the mismatch between the very personal style of Altman and the great weight of the impulse of the Grisham genre, did not excite me. The director's masterpieces in the 1970s revised and deconstructed several classic genres, including the Chandler detective film he resembled in a way; this time, the director seemed to have very few arrows in his analytical tremor to give a significant blow to the most vulnerable part of this bestial genre. Was he harassed by the mammonist producers, perhaps? Or am I missing something, due to my scarce knowledge of the gender that it assumes here? <br /> <br /> However, the casting was excellent in all aspects: Tom Berenger (for his terrifying ferality), Branagh for his (deflated The arrogance, the pheromonal haze of Robert Downey Jr., the method of garbage of Robert Duvall and Davidtz's hidden mortality were almost all perfect choices, and, except for a few slips from Georgia to Chicago by (the brunette?) Daryl Hannah, the accents were convincingly Southern. <br /> <br /> The suspense and the mood were absorbing, even if the story did not reach the limits.lookers The mood of a pre-hurricane barometric immersion on the coast was exquisite, meticulously performed.I felt like shouting at the usher that turn on the swamp cooler soon. <br /> <br /> In the end, I judged it a 7. <br /> <br />
