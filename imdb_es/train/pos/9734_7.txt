Well, here comes another romantic comedy ... but, unlike all the other films of this genre, this is the best I've seen in a long time .. <br /> <br /> I admit, at first I wanted to see this movie by Megan Fox, and a little bit by Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First of all, if you've seen a decent amount of movies, you know that Sidney and Alison would be together in the movie and, one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you will not know how ... <br /> <br /> Well, now this movie is made for Simon Pegg. I can not see any other actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure this would be a very weak movie if it were not for Pegg's great performance. <br /> <br /> There are a number of great jokes and jokes in this movie that made me laugh a lot, courtesy of the character of Simon Pegg, Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this movie (usually do not think of her as more than an average act). Although she was very good in this case, there is Jeff Bridges, Gillian Anderson and, of course, Megan Fox, who plays to the spoiled star Sophie Maes ... a great role for her ... <br /> <br /> In general, although I normally do not agree with her ratings on IMDb, this time I would completely agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go and see this movie, it's very happy and positive, and I highly recommend it ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
