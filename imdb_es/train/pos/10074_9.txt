quote from Nicolas Martin (nicmart) from Houston, TX: "Good movie, but DVD" reformatted for TV ", April 8, 2002 - This is a lovely and moving movie, and on the other hand, the DVD that I bought has been" reformatted " to adapt to your TV "by the clods in Columbia Tristar." There is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format, except that Hollywood treats all movies as the disposable garbage that is so accustomed to producing. br /> <br /> What (criminal!) shame, by the way. However, there is another version though. Check here for more information http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/kingofmasks.htm <br /> <br /> Wonderful performances by the two main actors (The King and Doggie) BTW.
