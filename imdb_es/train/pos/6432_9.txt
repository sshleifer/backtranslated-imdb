Thanks to an intelligent script and a firm hand of the writer / director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is an entertaining and very pleasant mystery thriller. The film begins methodically and accumulates as the tracks begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems to be. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are great, as they come together to unravel the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles, of the "Thin Man" movies. Kathleen Quinlan is excellent, as the tormented wife of Alex McArthur and the roles of the characters, played by veteran actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris are well done and provide many moments of light at the right time . There's even a cameo by Rex Linn. In general, I felt that I was reading a good book by the fire.
