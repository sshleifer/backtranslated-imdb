The first time I saw this movie was in the Eighties, but now revised, this suspense movie is still real. Some new films focus on similar themes, but do not coincide with this French milestone. <br /> <br /> A president, obviously JF Kennedy, is shot in an open car during a public appearance. The resulting huge investigation finds the figure of "Lee Harvey Oswald" guilty of this film, but a jury member insists on further investigation. It reveals some amazing proofs ... <br /> <br /> Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK, a film with the same plot, it does not play with emotions, but concentrates on an exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits. , drawing a new image of the murder. Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK, this movie is more reasonable, smart and exciting. Some parts of the plot can be found in many of the newer movies, I had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "I ... comme Icare" is a "must see". It is unique and brilliant, and the music of Ennio Morricone is wonderful. This film deserves a very good ranking, if it were a Hollywood production, it would undoubtedly be famous. <br /> <br />
