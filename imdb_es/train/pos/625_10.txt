This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow. <br /> <br /> It's strange that it completely surprises me, but possibly this is the best fantasy movie. Have I ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind and everything is the fault of Neil Gaiman. <br /> <br /> Sure, I could have been absorbed by the wonderful dialogue that was clever, flowed smoothly and was made The characters are completely believable. <br /> <br /> I could continue for days on the spectacular performance, Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines is brilliant as Yvaine and Robert Di Nero almost steals the film as Deep inside. The Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The pure joy brought about by the humor that managed to be Laugh our Loud funny, intelligent enough to make the first Shrek look like a Sitcom of the 80s, and perfectly combine with the rest of the movie would have just made this a great movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects were almost perfect, t It was not LOTR nor the extravagance of Star Wars SF, but where they were used were exactly what was requested, not too much to distract from the film itself and it was integrated perfectly in the story. <br /> <br /> Then, it's the story What can I say. How often do you come across a story that contains all the components of the classic fairy tale formula that does not present itself as another cheap imitation of Princess Bride? He manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time. <br /> <br /> Any of those things would have made this a good movie, all combined make it a great movie, but pale compared to the rich and charming world that these elements combine to give life to perfection. Once again, Neil Gaiman has done it, he has nailed another dagger in my heart by creating a fantasy world that is so beautiful and charming that he would do almost anything to live in it and just gave me a brief look. I did not want it to end, I wanted to be absorbed by a vortex to the land of Stormhold and meet Tristan and Yvaine in person, tour their fields and valleys, wander through their markets and meet their residents, both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. . It's a feeling that I've noticed every time I've read something about Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods, Coraline, they all left me with a deep sense of sadness when I finished reading them because it was over, I could not see anything else in the worlds that I had created, they seemed to be much more vibrant and alive than the one that I am forced to live and see Stardust was not different. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure Neil is writing and this movie will not have the same effect on everyone, but trust me when I tell you that you will not regret the time or money invested in seeing this movie, it's easily one of the 5 best movies I've seen and I can guarantee it to anyone. with a soul you will at least like it.
