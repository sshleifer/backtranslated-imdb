People expect nothing less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a film, and this film is no exception. Some movies that I love went wrong at the box office, but I'm happy to say that this movie is not one of them (more than nine million dollars, which I do not think was bad at the time). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not diffuse, and the music was also modern, which is unusual for an animated movie. I did not think that Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Circus" was too scary for young children (the target audience of this movie), but I thought that what happened to the creepy teacher at the end was a bit too dark for the children . movie. In general, this movie is a fun and charming classic that I have loved deeply for years.
