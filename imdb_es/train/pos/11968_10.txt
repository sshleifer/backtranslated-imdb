['Full House is a great show. I am still growing in it today. I started seeing him when he was 8 years old and now I&#39;m 12 and I still watch him. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. She is my favorite. she had so much sense of humor. In case there are people in this view that barely see the show, you should do it because you will get hooked. I hooked up with him after the first show I saw, which turned out to be the first episode, in 2002. It really is a good program. I really believe that this show should be of many generations in families. And it&#39;s also great because it&#39;s an appropriate show for all ages. and for all parents, he teaches children lessons on how to get on with their lives. Nothing terrible happens, like violence or the oath. It&#39;s just a great sit-com. I give it 5 out of 5 stars What do you think? OH and the best time to see it is when you are sick at home from school or even in the old office. It will make you feel much better. Trust me, I&#39;m almost not sick at home, but I still know what will make you feel better. and for all those who think that the program is stupid, that is very bad for you because you will not get that far in life, even if you are happy with your life. You really should see it and you will get hooked. I&#39;m just telling you what happened to me and everyone else who started watching this amazing show. Well, I need to go to lunch. Remember that you should start seeing the house full and soon!']
