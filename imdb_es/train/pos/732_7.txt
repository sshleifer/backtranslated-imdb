Well, I've finally come across "Rock 'N' Roll High School", almost 30 years after it first became a movie sensation at midnight in 1979. (As expected, probably first watch the new documentary of this summer "Patti Smith: Dream of Life" sometime around 2040!) And no, the movie does not seem to be a bit outdated, and yes, it was worth waiting for. This is a high energy comedy that presents a lot of good music and some amazing moments. Tells the story of Riff Randell, adorably played by Fr. Soles, and the battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High pay against their new repressive director, Ms. Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Movies," fairly accurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as an "evil Eve Arden.") A typical teen story against Establishment is reinforced here with an absurd humor (those explosive mice, that giant Mouse, the monitors of the Hansel and Gretel room) and some really exciting melodies. Riff is, of course, the # 1 fan of that original punk band, The Ramones, and that band delivers a dozen of their best songs during the course of the film, including five in a concert that is a total explosion. In fact, the sight of Riff dancing furiously to "Teen Lobotomy" in this explosion may be the funniest moment in the picture. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky on his Ramonesmobile, and then sliding down a street singing "I Just Wanna Have Something To Do," is quite exciting. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I imagine, the wet dream of every high school kid. Fun things indeed. On a side note, The Ramones was one of the loudest bands I've seen at a concert, so I was very surprised to note that the DVD of this movie comes with optional English subtitles for people with hearing problems. How many aged punks out there found these necessary subtitles, I wonder ...
