A great British movie of Indy! The fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters makes up some hilarious drug-fueled sets that Cheech and Chong would be proud of. It's great to see Phil Daniels again on the big screen (even if he has switched sides from Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a pleasure for the ladies! I loved the final scene of the fight with his nod to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on fire in Top of the Pops ... he's not acting ... he really is a real British hippie. !!! You do not have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's directly in my collection of repeated visits after the pub on Friday night. <br /> <br /> Try this movie and you will not be disappointed.
