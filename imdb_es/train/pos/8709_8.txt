Recently (May 2008) I discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Although I have seen a lot of high quality movies since then (late 70's (I had 10 in 1978)), this low budget episode of three episodes is still solid. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that I now saw him with my 10-year-old daughter, and she experiences the same thing I remember back then: the creepy music (I had to hold my hand, even though I raised her watching LotR and Resident Evil), changing the theories of who is really the culprit, and also complaining about the theatrical voices of a time before Norway discovered the difference between stage performance and film acting. <br /> <br /> This is the only and good science fiction movie (or series) ever made in Norway. And it's still worth seeing.
