I liked it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including little Arthur) is amazing and exciting. <br /> <br /> I could have used a little more screen time for the delightful Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham was amazingly "involved" since the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> The one that moved me the most through amazement, amazement and awe was Rupert Graves like Arthur Huntingdon. I adore it in Forsyte Saga, and everything else in which I have seen it. But he surpasses himself here as Arthur. In my wildest dreams I could not have imagined him playing an insane psychopath like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does it. And I love it. And I love it.
