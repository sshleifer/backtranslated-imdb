I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (is it well written?) On Cybil. I have not seen her for a while and I forgot how much I missed her. I thought she did a great job on this. The cast was also quite good. In some angles, the daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was pretty creepy and the story usually had some good turns. The young boyfriend was a hottie. I thought the husband definitely had something to do with that for sure. <br /> <br /> I just got Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and I love these movies. I kept my interest and will see it again when they execute it. Can anyone else recommend movies similar to this? You can post on the board or send me a private email if you wish. Thanks in advance.
