The end of the season sent mixed messages, I felt feelings of joy and also feelings of lying and cheating. Roseanne tells all her viewers that all season nine was a lie because her husband, Dan, had died. She also admits that the family never won the lottery, and that season 9 was a lie, simply because it was as she wanted or wanted it to be. I'm still confused about when he said that Becky ended with David, and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit to being pregnant. So I think that's how she wanted it to be, but it was not like that. So the end of the season was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
