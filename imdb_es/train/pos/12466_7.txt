If Jean Renoir's first film "Whirlpool of Fate" takes us for the first time to the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems right that his second film deals mostly with the rich and privileged, the upper classes and those who try to break through. Gather the characters from the first two movies and you will have the seeds of their great "Grand Illusion" and "Rules of the Game". This was filmed wonderfully, with the restless camera making full use of the incredibly large apartments and the behind-the-scenes areas that dominate the interiors of the film, and the acting, albeit too often, also offers some great moments, particularly from Werner's Mernat Krauss. But the glamorous and sensual Mrs. Hessling, who at first seems to be able to give Louise Brooks a run for her money on the vampire, never goes beyond a single note, a selfish representation of a harlot. Perhaps this is, in part, a problem with the script, which seems to go mainly for high points and indignant emotions; Having not read the novel, I am not sure if the options were well made or not. <br /> <br /> Even so, the differences between Nana's suitors are well defined, and I especially liked the relationship between Muffat and Vandeuvres by Jean Angelo - the tragic understandings that each one seems to have of their final destiny and their sympathy among them, particularly in the scene at the foot of the huge staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder if the violence will explode This and other discoveries of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help to give the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from his greatest achievement, and for me he's probably just generally shy of "Whirlpool of Fate", this is still worth seeing for Renoir fans or those interested in the cinema mute in general.
