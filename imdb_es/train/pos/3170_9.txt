The writer / director / co-star Adam Jones addresses great things. That's the thought I had after seeing his feature film "Cross Eyed". Rarely does an independent film make me feel as good as he does. Intelligently written and masterfully directed, "Cross Eyed" keeps you involved from start to finish. Adam Jones may not be a well-known name yet, but he will be. If this movie had one or two "Actors with a name", it would be a box office sensation. I think he still has the opportunity to be seen by a mainstream audience if only a movie distributor takes the time to work this movie. Regardless of where it ends, if you have the opportunity to see it, you will not be disappointed.
