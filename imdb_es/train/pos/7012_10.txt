Although a tear pull is definitely a "feel good" movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith, as always, does the work and does it well. I could go on, but choose ten of the "10" ratings and they have said it too, and probably better than me. <br /> <br /> BUT, since I must include at least 10 lines to post a comment, I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a spectator. Her performance was very pleasant and I hope to see her perform in many films to come. <br /> <br /> And, this movie shows that Will Smith has nothing more to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.
