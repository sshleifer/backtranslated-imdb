I came across this movie when I was at eBay's Caesars Palace, since I'm in love with its rich history of Las Vegas as the last of the original luxury resorts that are still in good condition (unless you have Bally's, the MGM Original Grand). In that sense, this film gives all the strength. You have been given a great tour of the property of Caesars, which despite all the renovations and additions that have been made during the 40 years it has been open, seems alarmingly similar. As a film in general, the plot is difficult to follow, thanks in large part to the horrific editing. And when I say horrible, I'm not using that word lightly. There are a lot of fragments of the second part of Las Vegas traffic, casino crowds and even a scene in which the character of Robert Drivas is talking to his father about how much he has grown up and without any explanation, he (Drivas) goes ( in those infamous fragments) of being himself, a baby, a small child, and then returning to himself while talking to his father. (That does not give any details of the plot, in any case, one can be prepared for it and maybe not as amazed as I am with the edition). The film has aged well otherwise, and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son that most men could relate to in some way or manner.
