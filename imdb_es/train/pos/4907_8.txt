A well-made and imaginative production, refreshingly free of clich√©s, this somewhat picaresque affair tells the story of a close friendship that develops between a man and a child in less than ideal conditions: the man is an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his Value as a hostage. Directed expertly by Alan Gibson with a great sense of balanced narrative movement, the film provides freshness in almost every scene, since the criminal Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his rejection of parole was particularly undeserved, creates a complicated escape plan but finally successful, after which his spontaneous nature is highlighted when he flees to the residence next to the lake of his childhood. Often, bursting into songs or dancing a few steps, the capricious Steckert gradually gains the confidence and affection of his captive and, as the police approach for an inevitable confrontation, it is seen that the tied couple is very similar in their responses to forms of rejection, as discerned by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) assigned to help a jealous police lieutenant (James Coburn) who is in charge of the persecution of Steckert and his "prisoner". This is a fascinating story, worth telling, a quick and novel adventure that benefits from a Harris performance, good turns from Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black, along with Justin Henry as the kidnapped boy, with an appropriately capricious score . contributed by Wilfred Josephs and the first-rate cinematography of Frank Watts, with all the images taken in a beautiful autumn province of Ontario.
