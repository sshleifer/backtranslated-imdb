In this Muppet movie, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are college graduates who decide to take their hit college musical, Manhattan Melodies, to Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will meet with the Muppets. After being denied by too many producers, Scooter suggests that the Muppets decide to go ahead on their own. However, Kermit still believes he can get his show on Broadway, but after he finally does and everyone knows he sold the show, Kermit gets the amnesia and the others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> This presents many great scenes, including a live action sequence that featured the Muppet Babies, a wedding sequence filled with Muppets, including the cast of Sesame Street and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock) , Scooter as a movie actor, and a scene where Rizzo and the other rats prepare breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that no more characters were included. Sure, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should be some important roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in this film as it was in the last season of The Muppet Show. and The Great Muppet Caper, and Miss Piggy Foo Foo's dog should also have been with her (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also played by Steve Whitmire, had an important role in this film, and was not well known in the moment).
