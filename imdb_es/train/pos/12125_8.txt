I went back to see this movie and I realized how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about Cary's childhood [Leslie Howard]. Considering that <br /> <br /> at that moment you can not see much on the screen, [not that there is much in the novel] the obsession of the character with Mildred [Bette Davis] is transmitted very well to the audience I recommend this movie to anyone who has fallen in love with someone else and the other side tried to take advantage of it. I read that Maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale, but when he started doing it in the studio, he started crying and could not finish more than a few lines and the whole project was discarded. It can be said that the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good adaptation of a part of it, at least.
