In my opinion, this is one of the best films that have been made in the United States and deserved each of the prizes it won and it is placed on the list of the best 100 of AFI (although it is shamefully too low in the list of 250 best of IMDB, only in 183 as of this writing). If you enjoy the performance of the highest caliber (Voight and Hoffman are an excellent combination), well-drawn characterizations and creative direction, editing and cinematography, you will love this as much as I do. Schlesinger paints a vivid and always believable image of the scene in New York City in the late sixties and many victims struggle to overcome personal demons and survive in the midst of amorality, poverty and despair of 42nd Street, New York City. <br /> <br /> The cinematographic techniques employed here brilliantly capture the sensation of the clandestine movement of New York cinema (and the city) and are nothing short of dazzling. I have seen many ideas (including the quick editing, the handling of the voice-over flashbacks, the drug / shooting sequences and the caricature drawn during a murder scene to convey anguish and terror) stolen by other filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way that it is seen as an unusually strong friendship OR that it has its homosexual bases. I think the director handled this in a subtle way not to face the censorship of the times, but to focus his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether sexual or not. <br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave and moving movie of magnitude, influence and importance that has lost absolutely no impact over the years, so if you have not seen it, you are really missing out on true American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
