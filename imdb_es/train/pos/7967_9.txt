This is definitely one of the best Disney movies ever made. It is a real pleasure for anyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will put you on hold. <br /> <br /> Basically, what Homeward Bound is about are three domestic pets that are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They do not know what is going on and, as they desperately want to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last films that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and kind golden retriever. In this film, Sally Field also performed, which provides the voice of Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this film is about is Chance! With the voice of Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor of all time), Chance is basically everything you would expect from a dog, kind, playful, energetic and ridiculous, and every time I reprimand you to see this movie, it is for Chance's fault; It's as if the comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is also very sad at times. Sometimes it reminds people of times when they were alone or when they lost their pets. <br /> <br /> A scene that always puts me on hold is the scene in which the trio is trying to escape from the pound; Especially I am surprised by the part in which Chance caught his collar in the fence and almost did not succeed. The movie had other moments of suspense, but none seems more suspense than that. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a wonderful family movie. If you liked this movie, you will probably also enjoy the sequel. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
