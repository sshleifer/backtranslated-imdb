When Sabrina appeared for the first time on our screens, she was around 12 years old and, therefore, I spent my adolescence watching the teenage witch get into all sorts of strange situations. <br /> <br /> It was always one of my favorite shows, the feeling of witchcraft. The comedy of the sixties 'Haunted', but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and calm, which made her enjoy watching her. The characters at the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the question teacher, Salem and Mr. Poole (my favorite, the shame that was so soon) Hilda and Zelda, their aunts started well, but then they became irritating. <br /> <br /> I liked Mr. Kraft too, since he was always a little closer to discovering Sabrina's secret. What I loved about the first three series were the original ideas, the discovery of the family secret and the learning of new spells, but as it progressed it became more predictable. Too many characters came and went, like Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and then they decided to make Sabrina in college, which ruined me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina absorbed herself in college, there was less magic, no spell book, no aunt living with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were upset. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring, and I just watched to see what happened at the end. Not having Hilda and Zelda seemed to be wrong in some way and Miles had left like this. The last episode made me feel much better, however (SPOILER) having Sabrina at the end with Harvey on her wedding day at dullard Aaron was great! In general, it is a great program if you forget the last two or three series that reminded me of so many shows for teenagers. Magical.
