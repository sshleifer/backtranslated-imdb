['The only comment about this movie seemed totally uninformative and too hard, so I decided to write mine. I saw this movie for the first time when it came out and I&#39;ve seen it a couple more times since then. First of all, let me say that, in general, what makes this movie CORRECT is what makes it worthwhile. It does not matter that you have some peculiarities of low budget and other failures. Worth seeing. The idea of basing a film on Walt Whitman&#39;s visit to a narrow-minded and narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The film is about the kind of humanizing catalysis that Whitman inspired in people. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The acting, especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor, is very good. The scripts and dialogue are strong and pay due attention to the customs and inflections of the time. In general, what do I not like? Also, to name another film in which Whitman comes alive so vividly?']
