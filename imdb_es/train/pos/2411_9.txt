This film seems to me one of the most successful attempts to find plausible answers to some of the annoying questions that have arisen in recent studies about the "Passion" story (suffering and death of Christ) in the New Testament. (What motivated Judas if money was not the problem? What could make the Sanhedrin gather on a high holy day? Why did Pilate embroider?) It is a film for serious and thinking Christians: fans of "The Passion of Christ "will certainly be disappointed by the lack of a bloody spectacle and the characterization of the arch. As for me, I find the portrait painted here, of the disposition of ordinary people to so blithely sacrifice common decency when their own interest is at stake, much more realistic and deeply disturbing. (The disinterested aspect of "just doing my job" on the face of the man who sticks the first nail into Christ's wrist is as chilling as at any time in the movie). The film does not claim the "authenticity", but the configuration and the costumes. It invariably feels more "right" than many other highly acclaimed efforts. It is a slow movie but, if it accepts its self-imposed limits (after all, it is "Death", not Life - "of Christ"), it is ultimately very rewarding.
