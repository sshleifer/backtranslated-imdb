11 Oscar nominations and zero victories !!! I still do not understand why, it's not like the actors in the movie did better after that, you can do it by giving them prizes for trivial papers like they did with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover All were amazing I'm curious to get scripts from the discussions at the Oscars that year ... I should go to the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges ... <br /> <br /> It's an amazing book, but true to style Alice Walker's writing, has a way of looking like it is exaggerating its characters, so I'm so glad that the adaptation to the screen has eliminated some things. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amazing, the African scenes live a lot to be desired, the African part in the book is supposed to be set in Liberia, somewhere in West Africa, BUT oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks that the world is so foolish that they can not think of Africa outside of the Safaris, so yes, there had to be a complementary scene of zebra and wildlife when we all know that there is no West Africa, and especially why the people to speak Swahili, who in Swahili speak in West Africa? I just had to remove it from the path ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story, incredible, making movies, out of this world, CLASSIC, yes! <br /> <br /> I have it and I see it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.
