['Taking advantage of the tendency of &quot;demons meets the clergy&quot; of the late &#39;60s / early&#39; 70s that included more prominently the triptych of &quot;Rosemary&#39;s Baby&quot;, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;The Omen&quot;, &quot;The Sentinel &quot;is an addition, that is just as good (although it is the one that is most overlooked). In a way, it combines the best elements of those films and releases in a pinch of Polanski&#39;s &quot;The Tenant&quot; (which came out the same year) just in case. A New York model who can not commit to her lawyer boyfriend is installed in a house covered in moss that initially seems to be the perfect place; he meets an old farce of a neighbor (the brilliant Burgess Meredith), in addition to the other decentralized tenants. Awakened by the noisy noises on her apartment, she soon discovers that a silent priest and she are the only residents in the building, who would otherwise be deserted. From there, director Michael Winner (&quot;Death Wish&quot;) launches this supernatural thriller, and there is a diabolical rejoicing at the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine. With the help of a brilliant cast, a subtle story and an excellent makeup of Dick Smith (&quot;The Exorcist&quot;), &quot;The Sentinel&quot; is a truly spooky horror movie.']
