Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in the entertainment world. I read your two books and I think it's great. Peter Faulk can deliver a slam line with the best of them. The combination of the two is magic. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family that is really known. Through a road trip, father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the midst of a family crisis. They do all the things that parents and children should do in life ... they are just doing them much later in life. The situations are very funny, but they have the feeling that they could really happen to people in real life (not in an exaggerated way or in cartoons). This is the first time I see Paul Reiser and I fully believed every emotion that was represented. Sometimes, his eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Film gret and great story and plot. It has comedy and emotion, but an encouraging message ... Olympia Dukakas also does a great job :)
