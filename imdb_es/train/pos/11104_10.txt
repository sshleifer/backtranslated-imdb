As the saga of the Godfather was the vision of the mafia from the executive suite, this series is a complex story of the mafia from the point of view of the worker. If you have never seen this program, a prolonged treatment awaits you. Yes, there is violence and nakedness, but it is never gratuitous and it is necessary to contrast Tony Soprano, the gangster of the thinking man, with the reality of the life in which he was born and, frankly, he would never have left even knowing how. So many of their associates have finished. Tony Soprano can talk about Sun Tzu with his therapist, then hit a man to death with a pan in a fit of rage, and by dismembering and getting rid of the body with his nephew, take a break, sit and watch TV while eating peanut Butter and give that nephew advice about their next marriage, as if they had finished on a Sunday afternoon to watch NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when given the opportunity to leave, discovers that he really prefers life with Tony and the benefits that accompany it and looking away from his indiscretions to life on his own. If you followed everything, you know how it ends. If you did not, trust me that you've never seen a TV show like this end.
