I loved! Fred MacMurray is wonderful, because Skid Johnson, a very arrogant and proud saxophonist, while very vulnerable, is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always at his side. They meet in Panama when Maggie leaves a boat and ends up in a bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony gets punched in the nose after insulting Maggie to think she is a loose woman, all because he took off his hat in public. Big fight and Maggie ends up trapped in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are very well together. Maggie is always there for him when he needs her. She exhorts him to go to New York where (see the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in her arms while he plays the saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
