A long-standing prison, closed for more than 20 years, reopens and Ethan Sharpe (the late actor and great character Lane Smith), once he was guard there, is placed as a guard. When the prisoners are put to work fixing the place, they are ordered to enter the old execution room. This unleashes a fierce spirit that wreaks no mercy on both the guards and the prisoners; Burke (Viggo Mortensen, who shows a true serenity in a first role) is involved in the role of hero. <br /> <br /> I know it's obvious to praise the film for its atmosphere (it was filmed in a penitentiary currently abandoned near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it elevates this horror movie to a higher level. He has a great feeling, established from the beginning. Director Renny Harlin made his fourth effort as director here; He got her the "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" directing concert and effectively started an impressive career in action movies, horror movies and action movies. He may have common characters, but he has a capable cast. giving them life: Chelsea Field as the young woman competing for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as the tired and veteran convict of Cresus, Tom Everett as restless with Rabbitt, Ivan Kane as the outgoing Lasagna, Tommy "Tiny" Lister as the giant of soft voice Tiny, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. It is also worth noting as an early acting credit for Kane Hodder (as the vengeful spirit) that helped * him * to get the Jason Voorhees concert in the series "Friday the 13.th". <br /> <br /> Decent special effects, whimsical lighting, courtesy of prolific genre filmmaker Mac Ahlberg, spooky music by Richard Band and Christopher Stone, excellent images, the incredibly somber location and a striking and intense presentation that makes it quite entertaining. It's nasty, scary and fun for a horror fan. <br /> <br /> 8/10
