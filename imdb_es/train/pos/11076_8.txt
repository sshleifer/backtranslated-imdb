I will begin by saying that this has been unmerited by almost everyone! The fact is that it was not what anyone expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone expected were cockney geezers and good phrases "do you like freckles?" etc, but this is much more mature than his previous works. I agree that it is confusing, but all the facts are there for us, we just have to see them and listen more carefully. This movie demands all your attention! Look beyond the fresh and dazzling aspect of the film, try to listen to the dialogue instead of admiring the performances and I think we will all get a fuller understanding of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this has its effect. Influences of modern classics (fight club, pulp fiction, etc.), but it is completely original, both in direction and in rhythm, with a score of incomparable music. I feel that if everyone saw this movie again and again, they would understand it much more and perhaps they would appreciate it for the good piece of modern cinema that it is, and I hope that Ritchie will continue in this vain, since I prefer him to his mockney. "masterpieces".
