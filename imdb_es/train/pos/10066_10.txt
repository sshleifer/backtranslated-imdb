King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a surprisingly beautiful and deeply moving film. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, this film based on a true story centers on Wang Bianlian, a street artist in the 1930's China who is getting older but has no heir to broadcast his opera art of changing faces He has a unique talent for quickly changing masks in performance, and nobody knows how he does it. He has a longing desire to have a grandchild, since his art is a family inheritance that can only be passed on to a male heir. Then, we go to the streets and we see that people are selling their children because they can not afford them; some are even asking for their daughters to be taken for free, because daughters are not worth much in this society. The story of Wang Bianlian continues from there. <br /> <br /> The film was surprisingly good, the performance was incredible and the problems were very important and well approached. There is gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this moment and place, nobody wants a girl. It is also interesting to note that the famous opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses like a woman, and although he is famous and respected, he considers himself to be something low, medium woman. As we advance in the film, we face the problems of the human slave trade and its demand and, therefore, the lack of a possible solution for it, the brutality and corruption of the military and the police, and the impotence and The lack of power that any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents another beautiful performance. .
