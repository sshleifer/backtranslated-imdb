My friend and I chose "Paperhouse" from a bunch of random movies on our weekly trip to the Horror section: none of us had heard of that, but the box's propaganda was really promising. And the movie did not disappoint me, although I probably still would not call it a horror movie exclusively. <br /> <br /> Anna Madden, 11, draws a house and visits her in her dreams. She is definitely asleep when she is seeing the house, but it is so real in a sense that it is almost like a completely separate reality. Which, in view of later events, does not seem far from the truth. Anyway, she finds that she can add to the house, its contents and surroundings by simply adding to the image. <br /> <br /> While this is happening, Anna is increasingly ill with a fever, and she is totally obsessed with the house and her drawing. Besides that, she and her mother are also dealing with their absent father; He has a job that takes him away for long periods of time, although one has the impression that there is actually more in history than that. <br /> <br /> Well, then the drawing sounds pretty good, but frankly there's something really threatening about it. The world of dreams is disturbingly surreal; the house, for example, is just a gray block in the middle of a desolate field. The people who made the film did a great job of making us feel very uncomfortable with this alternative world / dream in progress ... <br /> <br /> One of the things that Anna adds to the house is a child, Mark, who seems to be the same patient whose doctor is still talking (I'm not going to give that up, you know from the moment it seems that it's the same child). Actually, Mark can not walk due to illness; In the world of Anna's drawing, he can not walk because she did not make any leg. She blames herself for her real life illness, and tries to rectify the situation, but ... everything starts to get really weird. He even brings his absent father to the drawing, with disastrous results. The bits with the father are really frightening. <br /> <br /> I do not want to reveal anything, so I'll stop there ... It seems there are many things in this movie. I'm sure you'll have fun analyzing this with your friends after seeing it ... Is it a simple story as it seems, or are there really layers of meaning? I do not know, but in any case it's quite fascinating. There was a quality of "Nightmare on Elm Street" about it, since at some point reality and dreams are intertwined. I love those things. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it feels like it COULD have ended many times, but it did not. I am satisfied with the end you had (some of you sensitive guys should want to have Kleenex at hand!), Although I could really have a variety of conclusions. Anyway, it does not feel exactly spent once it's over, but as you look at it and it keeps disappearing, it's a little nervous. <br /> <br /> However, "Paperhouse" is a really good movie. It's well done, and acting, especially Charlotte Burke like Anna, is first class. Burke, who never before or since appeared in a movie, is a real gem. I do not know why he never did anything else, but in any case it is really convincing and enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not exactly a horror movie, it's a kind of fantasy / suspense / something more kind of movie, with some horrific moments defined, but you can still see it with your family and not worry about it that your little brother or grandmother gets tangled up in blood or something. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance, you will not regret it! And maybe you should read the book, too ...
