Very sweet pilot. The show reeks of Tim Burton's best films ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The cinematography, the narration, the music, the external scenarios, everyone shouts Tim Burton. There has to be a connection, or a STRONG influence, I just have not investigated enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I've seen on the forums, yes, Anna Friel is playing a poor man. Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen I see Zooey. Do not get me wrong, Anna Friel does a great job. Her character is very sweet and kind and you easily get hooked on her. I still think "Why did not they get Zooey Deschanel?" <br /> <br /> Lee Pace also does a great job. I kept trying to remember where I knew him and I just looked for him. Wonders! Great, a short series of 2004. If you enjoy Pushing Daisies, you MUST rent Wonderfalls, which is another creation of Brian Fuller ??. Hmmmm <br /> <br /> I loved watching Swoosie Kurtz (World According to Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little Shop of Horrors) again. Two actresses of an underestimated nature who never fail to bring him with their performances.
