This movie is worth seeing only for the outstanding portrait of John Lennon by Jared Harris. It does not matter that Harris does not look exactly like Lennon; His gestures, expressions, posture, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. The best scene: Lennon in a local cafe verbally trains with a stuttering fanatic about whether Paul McCartney & Wings' "Foolish Love Songs" are worthy of the # 1 state in the United States.
