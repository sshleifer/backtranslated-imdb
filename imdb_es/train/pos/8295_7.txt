Robert Urich was a good actor, and makes this television movie credible. I remember seeing this movie when I was 15 years old, and when I see it for the second time, my opinion is the same. People lose what they were when they enter this exclusive club, in a California city rich in computers. Urich tries to find out what's wrong with his family, and I love the idea of ​​the Halloween space suit, great. This movie is about the battle of one's spirit. Television quality, which exceeds, the big budget, Gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his films. I hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10.
