I really liked that movie. It is a definitive inspirational movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth the rent or worth buying. I should be in everyone's house. The best movie I've seen in a long time. It will drive you crazy because everyone is very bad with Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets better. It's a story of romance, drama, action and many fun lines to keep you tuned. I love many of the appointments. I use them all the time. They help me stay in the task of what I want to do. This shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is work to achieve it. It's a long movie, but every time I see it, I never realize it's as long as it is. I'm so absorbed in that, it's going so fast. I love this movie. I see it whenever I can.
