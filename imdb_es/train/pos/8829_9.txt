['More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need a greater outlet for their talents. 7:35 In the morning he is an absolute genius. What Nacho is capable of transmitting in 8 minutes requires some hours of film from Hollywood directors. I observed this smiling, but feeling a bit dirty and not sexually. You sit down and you wonder how you will feel after seeing this 8 min. nugget. I entertained myself, but it bothered me at the same time. There are not many people who can do that in just 8 minutes. Start simple enough. A young woman comes to breakfast in her usual place. She sits down and someone starts singing. From there, the film takes you through so many different emotions while being difficult to describe. It is black and white, but this helps with the feeling that the film gives you. This movie makes you want to know more about the characters, how they interacted previously and how the ending impacted their lives later. I suppose that as the old saying goes: &quot;Let them want more&quot;, Nacho Vigalondo can do that. Look at this when you can. Show it to your friends and ask yourself how 8 minutes can be so fun without taking off your clothes.']
