Please, future writers, producers and directors: learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> I had never before seen such a bold and original story created for the big movie screen. Audacious, because the script was constantly taking a step that many fantasy movies avoided safely: a step towards something new, creative and daring. Just when you think "oh, I've seen this before" or "I'm sure this is what will happen now": StarDust would take an unexpected turn and involve you more and more in the story. <br /> <br /> the actors are great, even the smallest part is made with such talent that fills me with amazement to the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is magnificent and acts with such energy that he simply steals the show in every scene he is in. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes is a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star', Yvaine. Other big names make outstanding roles. I had the filling that everyone is trying to give their best for this movie. But, once again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe, simply exceptional. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in a pre-selection today, one day before the official release. And I hope you have great success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments, as well as beautiful tender scenes. The look in Yvaine's eyes, the 'frivolities' of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia the witch: impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me, this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007, watch it and enjoy . <br /> <br /> 11/10 - Excellent <br /> <br /> peace and love
