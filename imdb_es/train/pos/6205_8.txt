Twisted, exasperating and implausible, Fay Grim is hard to see, but Parker Posey is really the only actress who can take this story and run with it. She is both touching, amusing, astute. Support actors also commit to it. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to tell you the plot. It involves characters of Henry Fool of Hartley and tries a history of international espionage. <br /> <br /> The movie works well if you continue with it, understanding that it does. In a sense, completely ridiculous. It gets more and more ridiculous as you go. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Fay Grim requires an adventurous spectator willing to face something that is not simple. In the end, it offers something that defies description.
