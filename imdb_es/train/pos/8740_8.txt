There are great details in the life of an insect. Everything is covered. The movie looks great and the animation is sometimes amazing. The film is not too terribly original, it's basically a modern version of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, only with bugs. However, I enjoyed the interaction of the character and the bad guys in this movie actually seemed to be bad. It seems that Disney usually makes carbon copy cuts from his bad guys. The grasshoppers are threatening and Hopper, the main bad boy, was a brilliant creation. Take a look at this.
