The Grand Canyon is in a very scarce category: it is a very intelligent film, with very intelligent dialogues and a source of reflection everywhere, from beginning to end. I have the impression that it never reached its deserved ranking (and I will never do it), due to its simplicity. This type of film needs sensitive observers. Too bad that IMDb makes me write ten lines, because this is not necessary in this particular case. Anyway, to comply with this request, I will tell you that the weak point of the film, if there is one, is in the performance: it is not that it is bad, but that it could have been made much better. Exception made for Kevin Kline who was perfect. Go ahead and look at it.
