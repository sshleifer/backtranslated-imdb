Ok, even if you can not stand Liza, this movie is really funny! The scenes with John Gielgud compensate Liza. One of the true classics of romantic comedy of the twentieth century. Dudley Moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and funny, and it's fun to watch! Those of a single line are the best.
