I saw this series when it premiered worldwide at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the film, where two men met and told a director from each country to direct a film about 911. These directors never met until the project was completed, and they saw how they all looked together . WARNING: SPOILERS NEXT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very powerful, and some were controversial. If you are American, you may not like this, as some of the pieces may be found as un-American. However, I know some Americans who enjoyed these series. The piece that I found the best was that of India. It was about how a Muslim family, living in the United States, had 2 children and one of them was missing. The Americans gave them a cold shoulder and automatically assumed that it was linked to the terrorist attack. It captures the mother's desperation and humiliation of these accusations so well, that it made me cry. In the end, we see that his son had died while trying to save the many victims of the shock of the towers. This was a true story, and that was what made it so real. There were many emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. It was funny but as powerful as the others. A must see for all, and we hope that the United States will eliminate this and let it play in their country.
