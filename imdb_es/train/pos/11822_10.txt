['Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies of all time. I must admit to those who have not seen it. You will really love him or really hate him. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone&#39;s expectations were so high that many were disappointed simply because the plot is very simple. But it&#39;s based on a comic strip ... what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is amazing! The scenarios, the makeup, the music, the costumes and the impressive performance make this film fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and does not have bad language, that&#39;s something weird these days. Directed, produced and starring Warren Beatty as the great crime fighter facing the evil Big Boy Caprice of Al Pacino and his group of thugs. Madonna steals the show as the seductive Mahoney breathless. This is one of the best characters that Madonna has played. She has the best linings I&#39;ve heard! Madonna fans would love it! One of the best things about the movie is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is truly a work of art that the public unfortunately overlooks. To summarize, this film shows the child in all of us. It&#39;s a movie that will leave you smiling at the end.']
