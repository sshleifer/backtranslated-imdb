A story about the British foreign legion in nineteenth-century India and a humble "water bearer" named Gunga Din, a local citizen who aspires to be like his military counterparts; three British sergeants whose loyalty and camaraderie extend beyond the limits of mere patriotism. His is a true and lasting friendship for each and every one would be willing to sacrifice his own life for the sake of the other. Gunga Din also wants to be a soldier, a Bugler in particular, but he can never reach that rank due to his subordinate social position. However, heroes are not made according to their social credentials, they are made through their willingness to sacrifice for the sake of others. Gunga Din tries at all times to prove his worth, but will he ever achieve the rank he passionately seeks? ... "You are a better man than me, Gunga Din." One of Hollywood's classics and a perfect 10 !!!!
