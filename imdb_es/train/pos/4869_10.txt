Not for people without a quick mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you do not have any of these you can not understand it. And if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think that Picasso is the name of a car produced by Citroen, probably if you see a Picasso painting, you will go through it and decide that it is a garbage job by a street painter. :) So do not judge, before trying to understand it :) In the end, I think it is a must for all with an open mind. Still my N1 is still the Redemption of Shawshank! And remember that not all things can be put into frames. Because there are things in this world, that any framework simply does not fit.
