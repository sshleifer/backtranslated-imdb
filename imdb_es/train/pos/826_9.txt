I'm sick of people complaining about Ewoks! It's true, they are not the best thing that has happened to Star Wars, but they did, so treat it! Also, they ARE cute, and I do not care if they are commercial. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves me crying. It is perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of Luke's entire story to Anakin. I love how it reveals itself in the end, since it would not be solved in any other way. So, those of you who complain that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It is very effective Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, finally reveals himself as a sick-looking man. It is not a machine at all, it is vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the casting director chose such good actors in A New Hope. Everyone does it so well. They are credible characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a good job as a female model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford: Need I say more? <br /> <br /> The music is once again brilliant. It's very moving and meaningful when you can choose character themes in different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" and jump to fight against his father in the final battle. John Williams is nothing less than a genius! What an amazing man! <br /> <br /> Ya, the movie has a lot more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can not wait to finally see it in the theaters (CAN I WAIT ???) and then look at the original trilogy once again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
