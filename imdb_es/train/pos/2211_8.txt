I do not watch much television, except The Office, Weeds, Entourage and E! 'S Soup. I think I have this program in good company. <br /> <br /> I love the scathing critique of pop culture that this program offers. Soup also helps me to be aware of what the people in the office are talking about when they talk about Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). <br /> <br /> The best part is that Soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (ahem, most people are hooked on watching American Idol because to the weird show that auditions are), for what most people say they see. And that means that I do not have to suffer through the other 98% of these talk shows or "reality shows" to numb the mind, for a nugget of "funny" or "shock". The only reason why Soup does not get a 10 in my opinion is that at some point the sketches are not so funny, and on an even more rare occasion, the comment is not always up to par. But neither can all be home runs, if so, Soup would not be in E! <br /> <br /> Joel's quick wit and the Soup writers team (which includes McHale) make a great show. It turns out that I enjoy the laughter and comments from the crew that are off camera. Even when they are blatantly obvious by occasional laughter of courtesy, it is very funny because it is forced. Obviously they are being ironic. And that's part of what makes this show fun.
