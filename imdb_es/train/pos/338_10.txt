I saw this film at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam and I had the privilege of getting to know both the directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom are living and open New Yorkers. The title of the film in Amsterdam was "Keep the river to your right", making the sensational aspect of cannibalism a little less prominent. Equally important was the love and gay relationship that Tobias Schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. Their reunion at 80 years of age and the inevitable abandonment were very moving. I can only recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that is not for pedestrians.
