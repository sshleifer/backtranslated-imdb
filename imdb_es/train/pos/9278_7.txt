In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, the other two Jafar Panahi films I've seen, the director draws surprising amounts of depth on topics that seem, superficially, mild. In Offside, Panahi's serious-economic tribute to Iranian women who defend their rights, I do not think it is so successful. It's not that what he says is not important, of course (and it's a pity that, as in almost all other Panahi movies, Iranians can not see it). But, after a while, the movie feels a bit flat and feels long even at 90 minutes. Although I do not say that I did not like it. All the actors are fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the film is contagious. But it's not an important job, in my opinion.
