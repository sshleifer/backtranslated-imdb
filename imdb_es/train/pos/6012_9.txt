['Antonioni was aiming for another hip masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic that &quot;Blow up.&quot; But it was not success with critics and young people like the previous one. Why? Maybe because it was a European vision of America full of clich√©s that did not work then and that have not aged well. (The revolutionary students at the beginning are shameful.) <br /><br /> Maybe when big successful films were released and those aimed specifically at the youth market seemed outdated. If it had been released a year earlier, maybe the hippes in the deserts would have seemed fresh ... Although it is a very interesting film, very well shot with some brilliant scenes and Antonionian in the middle, like the love in the desert, the stillness. from the desert mansion and the final explosive ... That the cables were two amateurs did not help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is a little better than Daria Halprin. It would have been much better with the right actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is actually quite funny and touching at times, although I would not know how the lines are delivered ... <br /><br /> A very interesting document from the end of the sixties that is worth seeing for the photography and the soundtrack ...']
