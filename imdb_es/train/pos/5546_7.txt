Some people say that this is the best movie that PRC has released, I'm not sure about that since I have a loving place in my heart for some of its mysteries. I will say that this is probably one of the most exclusive films that they, or any other studio, major or minor, have released. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The ghost of a poorly executed boatman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him, as well as all those in the spring. In this mixture comes the granddaughter of one of the victims of ghosts, the current boatman. She takes over the ferry business when the ghost approaches the man she loves. <br /> <br /> Wrapped in a dense fog and set primarily in the whole of a single swamp, it is more of a musical poem than a regular feature film. Listen to The rhythms of the dialogue, especially in the first scenes, are for them a poetic cadence. In the same way, there is a cadence similar to the work of the camera, since it travels from one side to another through the swamp, as if it crossed from one side to another between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object rather than a normal horror movie. It is a surprising cinematographic piece that is probably unique in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not for guiding Lilly. This is a low budget mystery / horror that tells you a little story that will keep you entertained. What matters here is his story of love and revenge, not the making of poetic films and what catches his attention (the technical aspects are the showcase). If there is any real defect, it is the low cost of production. The fog creates an environment, but also hides the fact that this swamp is completely on dry land. The constant coming and going through is fine for a while, but even after 58 minutes I wish we could see something else. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I really like the movie. It's a good movie that, somehow, I wish it was a little less poor. Definitely worth checking out if you can find it.
