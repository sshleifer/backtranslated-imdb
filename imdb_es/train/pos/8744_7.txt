This is a low budget movie with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of recordings in place. The Philippines replace Thailand and nobody really goes to Hong Kong. The stock image of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet that landed at the old airport makes the transition perfect. This movie shows that you do not need mega budgets or a main star to produce an excellent movie. It does not contain the errors or excesses with which young filmmakers often stumble. Solid workforce of people who know all aspects of filmmaking and who understand the compromises between art and box office. An excellent job!
