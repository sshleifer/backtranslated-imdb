One night, on a desolate road, in an empty classroom, Martin Sheen spins a thread by Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and his friends who track down a group of killer cattle thieves, who have killed a few men and kidnapped Cassidy's girl <br /> <br /> scriptwriter / director Christopher Coppola May may have provoked the wrath of William Boyd's purists by daring to make a modern low-budget movie with his beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did! No character should be so linked to an actor that no one else is allowed to interpret it again. <br /> <br /> I thought it was fun and an interesting update from the classic programmers of the thirties and forties Although it is guilty of a bad performance, this is serious enough and unpretentious, which makes it difficult for me to dislike . <br /> <br /> However, the whole production is a bit weird, but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we are seeing a story within a story makes rarities and exaggerations more acceptable.
