On the surface, this is a post-war romantic comedy above the average. Underneath the plate, he is the acrobatics actor of MGM characters in his funniest way. <br /> <br /> The tracks are direct, but all the secondaries are very against the type. Margaret Hamilton (also known as Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive-compulsive commotion), and Sig Ruman (the enemy of the Marx Brothers in _Night In Casablanca_ and the always wonderful _Night At The Opera_), playing well . intentional gang that tries to unite the two drivers, instead of separating them as their "usual" characters would. <br /> <br /> He also mocks many romantic comedy conventions, which is another indication that this might not be so much a "direct" romantic comedy, as it is an ironic dispatch of the many romantic post-war comedies and its 2-dimensional characters, in stock. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it Once, with interruptions, I can not be positive, but this movie may be one of the ones that worked best in the context of the time it was made, but now it's less successful than viewers "see" these secondary characters. A completely different lens. I guess this is the case when I give it 9 stars. I thought he was hysterical.
