At first I had the reaction of many people after seeing this: the shots of fat people sunbathing, etc. they were cheap shots in some way. It's fine so diane arbus is doing it. . . whatever is. . . But it was not long before I realized that this was not being done in a dehumanizing way. As the images developed, I felt that the problem was totally of the audience: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from almost everywhere to feel. That observing people of a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly, something that should not be shown. If this were all that was offered in the movie, it would be a big business. however, the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and her drunken friend really hits like a ton of bricks: very eloquent narrations, incredible performances, and thinking that the scene was improvised. That blond boy is an actor genius. Finally, I want to contradict those who say that this movie has to do with how pathetic these people are. The old man who is in the making with the woman who finally dances for him is completely a good character who breaks that mold, so do not oversimplify the film by ignoring it. Yes, your dog is killed. This is not a pink image of the world, but it is not. . . completely hopeless Anyway, I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film in general. I would not say that each of the threads was as strong as the strongest, but I say that this movie is basically great and I would recommend it a lot. . .
