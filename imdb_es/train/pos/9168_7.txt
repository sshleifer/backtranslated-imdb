This was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only problem I had was that I did not like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and I made Jane look too shy. In the book Jane seemed a much stronger character. I was really upset by this portrait of her. The part where it is the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs to him and hugs him, always makes me laugh. I think they made a bad decision by throwing it. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. He makes it worthwhile to see this version of Jane Eyre. Another thing that caused this version not to reach 100% was the quality of the film. I know it was made in the eighties for television. If it had been a feature film, and of better quality, it would have been perfect. However, my main complaint is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
