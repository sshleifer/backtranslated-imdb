An excellent movie Excellent performance by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role as Satin. This film was one of the last predominantly "all black" films of the 70s and, unlike the "blaxploitation" films of that time, this movie had an argument and was very well made. The soundtrack of the film, sung by Aretha Franklin, was popular on the R & B charts at that time.
