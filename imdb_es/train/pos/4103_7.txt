The main characters of this film are divided into two categories: intelligent and stupid. Pretty simple. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays a miserable and silly guy who is arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to get a financial refund for his evil boss, the situation gets out of control. <br /> <br /> While Standa is genuinely (but endearing) stupid, his friend Ondrej is a complete idiot who has nothing to do with everything. And he manages to say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa could have the opportunity to go through life with a modest degree of success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but surely it will not be without many headaches! <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, an evil genius who degenerates into a delirious tyrant of Hitler-esquire. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek's secrets safe. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has certainly produced more than its share of excellent entertainment. The best Czech films I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you watch these two films, you have seen the best of Czech cinema.
