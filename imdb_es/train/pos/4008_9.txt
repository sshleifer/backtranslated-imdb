['It is hard to imagine a director capable of shit as terrible as &#39;Notting Hill&#39; taking out something as sensitive and attractive as this, but hey, here is the evidence and it is quite convincing. Several have alluded to the television drama, and yes, this sometimes has a feeling of Play for Today of the seventies, but it is always superior, I think it is mainly due to a superlative performance by Anne Reid and a fine script that overshadows. with cliché without ever having one in the nose, except maybe just at the end. (I also did not like the follow-up photo of indifferent goodbyes in the corridor, nor the final scene of Oh-what-aa-beautiful-morning: she deserved a more studied ending than I think, after so much work. business was a little exaggerated too, in the reflection). <br /><br /> What I want to say about avoiding cliché: well, for my part, I had the expectation that the &quot;mature&quot; man that May&#39;s daughter would try to install would melt into 2 dimensions like an old, repulsive hole, to signal the contrast with greater pain. with the attractive, virile young man, he is unconsciously competing with him. Instead, we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo from a lonely, clumsy man, not at all unpleasant and very human, who nevertheless has no idea how to entertain a woman. It was around that point that I started to sit down and pay more attention. Here was a script that allowed the actors to breathe and do something interesting with quite minor parts. Almost Mike Leigh in that respect (minus the artificial catharsis that the latter inexplicably does for). <br /><br /> And, of course, I was, as probably everyone was, stupefied by what Anne Reid does with her character and body. She is / not / &quot;the repressed and obedient housewife who discovers herself for the first time&quot;, this is too simplistic for the character we have. Again and again, there are allusions that she has been a &quot;bad housewife&quot;, not to mention what she does with the trays, trying to look attentive and pleasant and only managing to appear clumsy. The daughter accuses her of having &quot;sat in front of the television all day&quot; instead of, well, whatever her maternal duties, she is supposed to have no answer. She was never a model wife and mother, at least not for herself; that&#39;s where a lot of the commotion comes from, the feeling that someone has wasted a life trying to fulfill a role that was simply not good, ever.']
