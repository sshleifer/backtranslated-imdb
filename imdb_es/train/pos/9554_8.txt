Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high spirit comedies I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> It is misunderstood because it lacks the values ​​of "social comments" that many films of the time (1969) should have. successful. <br /> <br /> The characters are exaggerated satires of ordinary people and are interpreted for that purpose by all actors. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines especially bright as Lord Foppington, a noble with hair too big to fit in the door. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the usual things of the eighteenth century; Wrong identities, frustrated romances, corrupt government officials and jokes at every step. <br /> <br /> Answer the questions: What happens when there are 4 rambunctious, eager to party in a small British coastal town? And, who do they get involved with and how is all this? <br /> <br /> Despite having poor performance at the box office, has a great wardrobe, excellent music (based on the musical Mermaid Theater of the same name), excellent, lively performance and sets that are obviously authentic. <br /> <br /> The fact that it has never been released on VHS or DVD is really a shame, since so many bad movies are released every day.
