All films made before 1912 must really be seen with a sense of time and place. <br /> <br /> In 1894, the men of the Lumiere family [father: Antoine (1840-1911), sons: Auguste and Louis] owned and managed a factory that manufactured plates and photographic paper. It is not a small company; The factory had more than 200 employees who received pensions and social security benefits, innovative for that moment. It was located in Montplaisir, in the suburbs of Lyon, France. What caused Louis Lumiere to be interested in the construction of a Cinematagraph, in 1894, remains open to speculation. My suggestion is that the appearance of the Kinetoscope (peep-show machine) of the Edison organization in Paris during the autumn of 1894 provided the catalyst. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Dickson, from Edison's staff, invented a film camera the size of a vertical piano that was patented in February 1893. It was electrically operated (using the energy of heavy storage batteries.) This huge strip of celluloid film pumped by machine ( recently developed by The Eastman Company) passed a lens of approximately 40 frames per second (fps) .It was placed, like an almost immovable object, in the "Black Maria" (essentially the first film studio) .The Kinetescope machines showed presentations in scene (less than one minute long) that were shot in this studio. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumiere devoted himself to the task of inventing a moving image camera. 16 fps onwards, the celluloid film, the persistent vision of the human brain / eye would allow normal movement to be perceived. about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a removable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make one take about a minute when it was rotated past the lens at 16 fps. <br /> <br /> The size and light weight of the camera (it could be converted into a printer or a projector by adding a light source made it portable enough to be able to take it anywhere to record an event (as long as there was sufficient sunlight available.) In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed: trick on the part of some men of cavalry, a burning house with firemen arriving and spraying the building swallowed with water, and a series of Other scenes in and around Lyon Using a Molteni bulb, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists gathered in the reception room of the Revue Generales de Science .The images were projected on a screen five meters away The screen stretched on a door between two rooms, and at a meeting of professional photographers that same year, Louis photographed the delegates arriving and the same night. showed images of his arrival. <br /> <br /> With praise from the scientific and photographic communities, Louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention at the end of the year. Since each of his films would last about a minute, he would need at least a dozen movies to make a good presentation. For one of these films, he installed his camera at the entrance of his factory, photographing the exit of employees at the time of quitting. <br /> <br /> The public place chosen by Antoine, who offered himself as the "fair vendor". "for the Cinematograph - it was the Indien Salon of the Grand Cafe on the boulevard des Capucines in Paris, it was a winter Saturday night on December 28, 1895. When the first audience sat, they were presented with a projected view of the exterior of the Lumiere factory (with closed doors) Some were upset because they were just going to see a slide show of Lumiere's photographs, but then the camera / projector's crank turned and the movement began Louis had an innate sense to The making of moving images This film has a beginning, a middle and an end.In the beginning, the doors open and people start to leave their workplace, in the middle, people run away, with many trying to Ignore the camera and the cameraman, as they seem happy to leave behind a day of work.At the end, the factory doors are closing. <br /> <br /> And this was the first movie projected for the entertainment of the general public.
