My Super Ex-Girlfriend is an entertaining movie, neither more nor less. <br /> <br /> The story is simple quiet. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the subway and connects with her. At the beginning of their relationship, everything seems fine, but then Matt discovers that she is G-Girl. At first, Matt seems very good, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So she decides to break up with her and connect with her colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very angry and starts to get revenge on her ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the movie are the scenes in which G-Girl takes revenge on Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in another role, then in her character in the Scary Movie saga. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 7 out of 10 and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy.
