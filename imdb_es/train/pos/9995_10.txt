This is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine, the fire on and with your feet up. It does not require much mental power to follow, so it is very good after a long day. I would say that it is very unrealistic: if you expect something serious, do not worry, but it is very funny. Only the idea that a businessman would go so far as to accept living in a poor neighborhood for a while and then enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
