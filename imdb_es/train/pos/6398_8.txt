The "inspiring" stories about the "triumph of the human spirit" tend to be great detours for me. The most amazing thing about MEN OF HONOR is how much I enjoyed it despite myself. The movie is as predictable and cliched as possible, but it works. Much credit goes to the stimulating performances of both drivers. It's a perfect paper for Cuba Gooding, Jr., which is wonderfully restricted here. We expect a lot from De Niro, and he does not disappoint. He creates a funny dark portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr. set out to make an old-style movie and has a winner.
