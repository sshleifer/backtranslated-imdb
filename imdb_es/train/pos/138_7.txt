['I do not understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey. He has never been a very interesting film actor. <br /><br /> The best part of this movie is writing and wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make an unusual comics duo, they are definitely not action types. Although you can not say that your characters are well developed, that does not make them less funny. <br /><br /> The version I saw was in HDNET and had subtitles for the dialogue in Spanish, so it certainly was not a problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. <br /><br /> A very underestimated movie, judging by the unusually low score that the IMDb members have awarded it. I thought it was fun and interesting and at least it was worth 7. Many less interesting movies with higher scores and making a lot of money at the box office are much less interesting.']
