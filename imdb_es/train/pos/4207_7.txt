Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) Candy's wallet (Jean Peters) containing an important microfiche for the communist cause. It is followed by 2 federal agents who are waiting to attack once they deliver the microfiche to their contact. However, Skip steals the bag in the subway under the noses of everyone and so begins to look for both the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy, who want to return the microfiche. Skip can only be traced through Moe (Thelma Ritter), who sells information about criminals. Skip is clear that what he has stolen is important and that both parties want the movie, but that he intends to keep a high price. This leads Joey to hunt him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It's a well-acted movie and it has a good start that involves you immediately. It is a little unrealistic how Jean Peters falls in love with Widmark immediately, but this point is necessary, since otherwise, why would he resist Joey? It's a good movie.
