Although this film is a bit disinfected (because it was done at a time when people just did not talk about sex), it is an extremely useful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. It is not surprising that the Kotex company paid for it, although what may surprise many is that Disney made this film, since they made many educational films during the 1940-60 years. However, although the film is well made, I think the filmmaker missed a real opportunity. Instead of the pleasant voice of the female narrator and the relatively soft images, it would have been great if they had used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang! I know this would have given Old Walt a heart attack, but wow, that would have been a great movie! By the way, although the notion of sex is only insinuated in the film, YES adequately explains menstruation in general. However, I am missing some details (especially on sexual relationships) that I suppose were included in the accompanying booklet. <br /> <br /> Now if I can only find out why I saw a cartoon about menstruation.
