['While reading the comments left for this program, I could not help noticing that a large percentage of the reviewers had not seen any episode of the program in its entirety or of their own free will. Kerching thing! is that it is a program for children, FOR CHILDREN, so obviously, if you are older, it will seem corny, forced and probably stupid. I even found a person who said the games were stupid, but I remember when I was eight years old I wondered why Taj had Ikea ice tube molds on his wall, and I also wondered if my parents would let me put some in mine (They did not) Yes, it can be annoying, the acting could be better and some of the characters do very strange things with their hair, but as a children&#39;s show, I rate it as 10/10. In comparison to the things that air in their place today, well, let&#39;s say that I would like it to be re-issued. DVD release, someone?']
