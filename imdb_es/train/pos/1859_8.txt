In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington takes a real story that also turns out to be a very difficult story and presents it to the screen with the honesty we expect from Washington's acting efforts, but now we see this touch as a director. <br /> <br /> We have recently seen some of the disastrous results of children who have fallen into the cracks of public protection. This story speaks of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars, but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> We can detect some problems of first effort with too many approaches and not the best to edit these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> If the academy ignores this movie, it will be a farce. This film does not shoot and goes to the hard and cold facts of history with a purity that generally does not transcend a novel to the screen. This, of course, is a tribute to the Director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends that they will see it too.
