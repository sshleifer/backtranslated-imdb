A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in the Oscar-winning performance) who is harassed by his own conscience. McLaglen plays a rouge IRA that betrays its leader to collect a reward during the Sinn Fein Rebellion of Ireland. The scenes that show fights and actions of the mafia are very realistic, and focus on the despair within the individuals. The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford magnificently creates a turbid and tense atmosphere, enhanced by the hazy and grimy depiction of the Irish landscape. The dramatic music of Max Steiner adds to the cinematic delight. Oscar Winner also for Best Screenplay, nominated for Best Film. This is one of Hollywood's classics.
