**** SPOILERS **** A powerful film that shows how men in desperate situations can come to sacrifice their best friends and family and not realize what monsters they are doing. Until in the case of Gypo Noland, similar to a bull, Victor Mclaglen, it is too late. <br /> <br /> It's 1922 and the height of the revolt of Black & Tan Irish against the mighty British Empire with the Tans, British occupation troops, in search of the Irish Republican rebel Frankie McPhillip, Wallace Ford, wanted by the murder of a briish soldier. Gypo is good, really the best, the friend of the fugitive McPhillip is unlucky not to have a job with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Grahame, forced to do tricks in the red district of Dublin to pay his rent. <Br /> <br /> After an outraged Gypo worked with a potential John who wanted to spend a few hours with Katie, for a shilling or two, Katie angrily told the not-so-bright Gyro that he was preventing her from leaning with the only profitable asset he has, his body. Katie also tells Gypo that he must wake up to reality and realize the desperate situation in which he finds himself. Telling Gypo, who has the nerves of the mind, that it would only cost him ten pounds to go to the United States and get out of the poverty of Ireland, Gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend Frankie McPhillip who has just seen announcing a reward of 20 pounds sterling. It's enough money for him and Kaite to travel to the United States. <br /> <br /> Gypo going to a local house in Dublin on a flop and in a food court to get a free meal is surprised to find his friend Frankie McPhillip. Frankie tells him that he sneaked off to Dublin to see his mother, Mrs. McPhillip, and his sister Mary, Una O'Connor and Heather Angel, and if he can make sure everything is safe for him to go home and then march for your Irish republican. Drive out of the city. <br /> <br /> All that Gypo can see in Frankie's face is the Â£ 20 reward for being turned over to the police. Without thinking twice, after he assured Frankie that everything is fine, Gypo goes to the police in secret and reports on his friend who was then shot to death in a police shooting and Tan in his mother's house . <br /> <With the act done, the police chief delivers the pound sterling 20 pounds, like thirty pieces of silver, to an almost emotionless Gypo who takes it and escapes through the back door of the police station to that one can see it. . It can be seen in the face and actions of the police chief who has nothing but an absolute disregard for Gypo's betrayal of his friend Frankie McPhillip. Although he was wanted for murder and enemy of the British Empire. This is how low traitors or informers are held back even by those for whom they work in secret. <br /> <br /> Gypo turns out to be his worst enemy after his betrayal of Frankie when his conscience takes control of his mind. Gypo sees and hears everyone, even his carefree girlfriend Katie, pointing a finger and implicating him in the betrayal and death of Frankie at the hands of the British authorities. Gypo's guilty mind has him drunk and gloriously drunk, for the money of the reward, that at the moment he is forced to admit his crime to his colleagues in the Irish Republican Army, that he had Gypo drunk and slobber in the trial , the money was almost gone at his party drinking and prostituting. <br /> <br /> Whatever the good feeling is, if that is possible, that it had for the weak and strong shoulders, Gypo was completely demolished when he was in an act of total despair, in order to prevent him from shoot, he falsely implicated an innocent man, Mulligan, Donald Meek, in his crime of informing his friend Frankie McPhillip. Which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by Gypo himself, who is guilty. The dye is then projected while drawing straws for who would be the one who would place a bullet in the head of Gypo for the final chapter of shedding this heartbreaking and unforgettable classic of crime and punishment.
