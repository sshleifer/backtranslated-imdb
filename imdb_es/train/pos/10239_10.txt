I do not agree with someone who did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I used to LOVE this movie when I was little and I still do it. It's sweet, fun and warms your heart. And it shows that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And even though I did not have much history, it was still excellent, I give it a 10 and two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and it shows that your deepest wishes and dreams can come true. (Tear, tear) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, personally, if someone says it stunk, then I'll say "What a shame". Because it was a lovely little movie and I'm glad that at least some people liked it.
