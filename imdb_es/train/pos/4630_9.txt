['This is the second Eytan Fox movie I&#39;ve seen. The fantastic actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, also has a minor role in this film. <br /><br /> But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a small apartment: Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who joins them from time to time: Ashraf (Yousef &#39;Joe&#39; Sweid). There is a kind of Friendship / Sex in the City (mostly homosexuals), and everyone wants the war to end so they can continue with their lives in peace. <br /><br /> But that&#39;s the problem. No matter how many posters you place or how many raves for peace, the war will not end. Many have tried over the years to bring both sides to the table, but they just want to keep it for any reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both there and here in the United States, who want everything and will not consider peace. There are many on the Palestinian side who apparently would be without work if peace came. Nobody is interested in ending this war, and children suffer. <br /><br /> This is always in your mind while you watch this funny and interesting movie. Will not go away. You know something tragic is going to happen and, of course, it happens. With the feelings of both sides running strong, and revenge as a motivator, tragedy always happens, and that&#39;s what makes this an adult version of Friends / Sex in the City. There is no superficiality. It&#39;s real life, and it was a beautiful thing to see.']
