I thought this was a very good movie. It would have been nice to have seen a little more in the movie about the 2 sisters who knew that everyone liked the same guy before they killed him. I am sure that if the film had been made in this way, there would have been a very different ending, which is why this movement made such a good movie. Show that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings, you can always overcome it and that if you are 2 sisters dealing with a child, (the same child) the fact of overcoming pain and pain makes things look better and easier. To work between the 2 of them. It's nice to see love stories that happen terrible things in someone's life that you can still get closer to after you finish. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still do it when it turns on. It seems that I am watching each time it is turned on. It would have been nice if there had been a part 2 for this movie, maybe having the older sister to come and have her baby, this would really have made a great end to the story since she died, in this way it would stay. He is alive even though he is dead.
