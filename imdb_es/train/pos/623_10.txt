['There are not many movies around that have given me the feeling that Stardust made the whole course of the film. As magically as a fairy tale like The Princess Bride, Stardust is definitely the most wonderful fantasy show of the 2000s and 1990s. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful images as well as unforgettable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro, challenge to anyone to see this movie without smiling. From the first ten minutes of the film, you know exactly how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that captivates the viewer from beginning to end. <br /><br /> Ten stars, and not a decimal less.']
