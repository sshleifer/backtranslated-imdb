That is not a criticism of the film, but rather a comment about how blind we are of our own past. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or a sequel, except it was Iraq and not Vietnam. Like Winter Soldier because of their one-sided message, both films illustrate how blithely we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretexts, and allow our young and brave (and often na√Øve) to assume the weight of this greedy deception of war. Both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of young people and willing to make them efficient killing machines, but the training is not enough to teach the diplomatic and police skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people that supposedly fighting for. Ultimately, this is what the war in Vietnam lost, and probably will also lose the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided that it could easily pass as left propaganda. Not for me, mind you, but for those who want to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced view would speak to a wider audience.
