If you like CB4, you have no idea what you're missing if you have not seen this movie yet. This movie is incredibly funny, and incorporates much more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie ... It's a pity that this movie has not been released on DVD because it's a movie that I've all seen it with. He has loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and you're a little familiar with some old-school artists, definitely rent this movie. There are not many video rental places that have copies, but if you come across one, you will not be disappointed.
