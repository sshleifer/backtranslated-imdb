Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about a teenager (Weems) with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and his 11 friends who take him on a trip around the country to see if "Pimp My Ride" is going to get out of his wheelchair. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. He played twice during the course of the festival. This movie is an incredible story about the human spirit and the spirit of Weem's friends. I do not say this often about movies, but after watching this movie, I feel moved to do something for the cause. In each festival in which this film has participated, this film has won an award of some kind. He is at the Tribeca Film Festival, and goes to London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie reached the Academy Awards. It's snowball out of control. If someone has the opportunity to see this movie, wherever it is playing, go! Take as many people as possible and leave! He heads to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius is from Georgia, so I hope tickets for concerts in Atlanta will sell out quickly, if they are not already. Please, go see this movie! DGW (talks about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
