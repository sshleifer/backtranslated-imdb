A wonderful movie, free flowing, often lyrical that drags you, always smiling, even if there are really surprising incidents along the way. One is left breathless at the way women are treated and yet, ultimately, it seems that they manage very well and it is a merit for all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes work very well. This is possibly the best performance of Depardieu, undoubtedly the most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and includes vigorous sex scenes with a couple of men at least half their age. Miou-Miou is charming at all times and again has very difficult scenes to interpret. Initially, this looks like a bad and dirty misogyny, but as the story and the characters unfold, a much more tender and honest image emerges. In the end, this intransigent and audacious film demands respect.
