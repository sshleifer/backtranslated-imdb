An excellent description of one of the most damaging aspects of that era. I loved the visual elements, very suitable for a story related to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was really great at this, he found himself very well as someone who has been hardened by his work (which he did not choose completely for himself) but still wants to have a normal life for his family. He does the best he can to see that happen. Do not want to spoil the plot, but you MUST SEE this movie if you are a person who wants more than one movie than the usual action / gangster shooting format. (Although it is violent).
