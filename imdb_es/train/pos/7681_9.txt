The 'sexploitation' of children is one of the most serious problems facing our world today and I was afraid that any film on the subject would jump directly into scenes of an explicitly sexual nature to impact and disturb the public. After having seen 'Trade' and 'Holly', a movie motivated me to want to see a change in international law. The other one felt like a poor attempt to make me cry for five minutes with emotional music and the strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not think turning this problem into a Hollywood tear-jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt, and I must recommend the "Holly" brands for subtle but powerful engagement with the terrible conditions of these children. Unfortunately they are forced to endure. The "trade" oscillated between the serious and the stupid with scenes that involved the death of a cat that came after images that represented children forced to commit some horrendous acts. I found it uninteresting and, at times, offensive to the cause. If I wanted a cheap laugh, I would not have signed up for a movie about trafficking in children. <br /> <br /> For anyone who wants to see a powerful movie that really means something that would suggest saving money on the movie ticket for the 'Holly' release.
