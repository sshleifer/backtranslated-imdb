['OK, this movie was great. I do not think it was the best movie ever made, but it sure was fun. My brother and I still play scenes from time to time, and from time to time we take the film out of the closet, take it out of the dust and introduce it. Nice until the end, but it&#39;s a great concept. This is a movie that you have to forget the criticism and enjoy. The trial is victory for Robot Jox.']
