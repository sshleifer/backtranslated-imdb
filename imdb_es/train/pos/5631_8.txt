Congratulations to Fawcett for taking on roles that, at that time, were considered controversial. As I recall, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and the rights and emotions of women were rarely examined so deeply during that time. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed by actor James. Russo. It is appropriate as the psychopath obsessed, but sometimes it is a bit transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a small role, as does Alfre Woodard as a housemate. Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett, the rape victim, takes revenge on the culprit. The scene in which he throws a pan of hot oil at Russo is classic, and as the rapist deserves it. Then he keeps him in captivity, and the consequences must be faced. <br /> <br /> A very real story that reflects the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been physically and mentally violated. Highly recommended 8/10.
