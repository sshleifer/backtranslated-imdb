Believe it or not, at 12 minutes, this movie (for 1912) is a long-running movie. Very, very few movies were longer than that back then, but that is definitely NOT what distinguishes this little and strange movie from the rest! No, what is different is that all the actors (with the exception of a frog) are bugs ... yes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy could have looked a lot like productions starring artists like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead, this Russian production uses errors (or, I think, models that looked like mistakes). Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy had not yet been discovered and I assume Linder was busy, so maybe that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the insects moved, danced and fought incredibly well, and were much more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Mr. Beetle sneaking around for a while. He goes to an obscene club while his wife supposedly waits at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, he is caught on camera by a local movie buff. Besides, he does not know it, but Mrs. Beetle is also working with a Bohemian grasshopper painter. Of course, this domestic comedy has much more than this, but the plot is historical and very entertaining for adults and children alike. <br /> <br /> Strange but also very surprising and observable.
