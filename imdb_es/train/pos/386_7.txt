The visual art of Tsui Hark is in sight of this film. Unfortunately, the terrible performance of Ekin Cheng and especially of Cecilia Cheung (I felt the need to strangle her while watching this, is so bad) that sometimes it is difficult to see. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real breakthrough. in the visual department. When I saw it for the first time, I was dumbfounded several times and thought that I had never seen anything like that remotely, but this is how it should be done to do full justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical kung fu novels. ! Undoubtedly, this is one of the most attractive Chinese historical kung fu epics ever made. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, Tsui Hark has not improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are quite youthful (his apparent obsession with the silly and too-long representation of the evil types either. helped). To make matters worse, this movie is very badly launched. They decided to use the popular idols of Hong Kong as "main characters", but unfortunately, both Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are totally inadequate for the historical dramas of kung fu because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters must embody. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. <br /> <br /> I hope that one day Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark can join forces and produce a film that has the visual art of Tsui, but with the maturity and poetry of Zhang's stories ...
