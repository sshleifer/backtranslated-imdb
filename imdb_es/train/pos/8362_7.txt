Updated version of a story that became the movie in 1938 England (Return of the Frog) about the police search of a criminal criminal known as the Frog because the frog gets up (bulging eyes, etc.) what did you see. <br /> <br /> One of Wallace's good films of the 1960s is a solid little entertainment. Clearly influenced (or made this influence) the rebooting of Dr. Mabuse's films, the frog seems to be more of a super villain than a master thief. While it's not the best of Wallace's films, it's worth seeing. It would be an interesting double feature with the previous excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 of 10.
