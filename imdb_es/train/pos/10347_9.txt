Charming minor film, juggling with comedy and detectives, romance and drama genres as skillfully as Lieutenant Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) balances his devotion for his girl Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and his duty with strength as a detective. <br /> <br /> It is possible that this hodge-podge is not attractive to all the spectators of today, but in its day, it had something to offer to each member of the family that attended the film, and the resolution of the plot of the fatigue of feelings is something original. And refreshing, and well worth the wait. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Mr. Williams" contains what must be one of the most outrageous blind dates in film history, and its brilliant comic abstracts shine. With a ridiculous dress, Melvyn Douglas offers some of the best phrases: "I was walking down Main Street on a Turkish towel before letting any woman control my life!" And the effervescent Joan Blondell lets her spines fly with a typical aplomb: "My God, you look like my Aunt Nellie!" <br /> <br /> The crime resolution here is the standard fare, although an excellent cast of character actors helps bring the material to life. <br /> <br /> From today's point of view, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" is perhaps more interesting for its insightful comment on gender as a socially defined construction, and much more malleable for its seemingly rigid limits. While much of the commentary on the genre takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, it is sometimes as subtle as Penetrating, playing not only on some of the finer details of the film, but on the battle of genres that comes to its culmination in the final scene.
