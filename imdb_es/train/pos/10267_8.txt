['Enough has been written about Mamet&#39;s &quot;The House of the Games&quot;; I decided to watch the film again to see how it was kept after 17 years and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed watching it again. The success and durability of the film probably have a lot to do with two main ingredients that are always fun in the movie; A good story and a good scam. Mamet manages to bring the film its bad mood and its obvious histrionics while we cheat, the public and the brand simultaneously. Then explain the art of cheating just to do it again, etc. while building the story. &quot;The House of Games&quot;, now a free cable show, is worth seeing for the first time and a good start for Mamet fans.
