Having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer, I had to watch this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell presented that it had to be good. And he gave himself up. In general, the movie is not fun, but there is a scene that really stands out and is, in my eyes, a classic. SPOILER In the end, where they break the wall to get to the safe and we see that Rockwell and Washington look at Jeter is simply fantastic. This is as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude is using a chair to lock his door, but he forgets that the door is turned outward. FINAL SPOILER Just go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
