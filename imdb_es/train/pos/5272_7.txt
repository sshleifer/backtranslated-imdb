Deodato brings us some slightly shocking moments and a movie that is not taken too seriously. Absolutely a classic in his own particular style. This film offers a different refreshing look to the barbarians. If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it. You will definitely have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because it's fun or something as mundane as that, but because it's so bad that it goes out the other way and becomes good, although it may not be clean, fun.
