The work of Ed Harris in this film is at his usual level of excellence, that is, he steals the screen from anyone with whom he shares it, and that includes the formidable Sean Connery. The film, which is more than a little dangerous, comes alive only in the scenes in which Harris is interrogated by the lawyer of another convict. It's impressive, a master class in artistic control. <br /> <br /> The other cast members are all adepts and Connery is reliable, as is Fishbourne, but the story itself is unparalleled. The plot depends to a great extent on the premise that a black prisoner will always be mistreated and coerced by white policemen. This is the engine that drives the story, right or wrong, and makes you feel a bit cheated in the end. <br /> <br /> However, it's worth seeing to see Harris in action.
