I just got back from the premiere of Zero Day in Montreal ... and I'm very surprised to find a negative comment about the movie. Basically, the fault is that Coccio is making an easy and exaggerated social message ... well, sir-I'm-a-critic, he's an easy and exaggerated critic of movies with a social burden. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but I come from a small town with a similar school to which these guys go. Rejection and ignorance in the menu. The thing is ... I understand how young children can be driven to make such horror. High schools have become conforming battlefields. It is a really ugly sight. You need to fight to be like the others. It's hard to explain, but many people do not realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents close their eyes and smile about how their life in their comfortable neighborhood is perfect. <br /> <br /> The real reason for the movie is not what drives them. It is a quiet suburb like death and everyone close their eyes and try to create this perfect city atmosphere. Cal expressed it well. It is a wake-up call. The drama is everywhere and can take all forms. In that case, small dramas (like the fact that Andre is called a fag for wearing a J.C Penny shirt) are becoming the worst nightmare of an entire town. Andre and Cal took the most extreme form of expressing their pain. The discomfort of dissent in an era in which you need more than ever to be like others to be accepted. <br /> <br /> I especially like the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of Andre & Cal, as if ... With the pain they communicated, Cal and Andre have communicated their blind rage to their community, their Refusal to think about the causes of some acts. <br /> <br /> It may seem aggressive like a movie, but Coccio is meditating rather than whining or enunciating. What Andre and Cal live is a reality ... and one that can scare other children. <br /> <br /> Disturbing movie ... The fact of being at home and the strong feeling made Ben Coccio make a very disturbing movie.
