Why is this so low? I really do not understand ... Is it because of the bad performance? The bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in low-budget horror films? Seriously, acting and dialogue is not important in those films. People who hate movies just for their bad acting and bad dialogue should not be allowed to rate low-budget cheesy movies. Those movies should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I expected a gorefest, but it's not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad (most of the time it's just gills of animals placed on the bodies of the actors and that's boring), but I really did not care because the The movie is hilarious! The characters are fun, the performance is hilarious (the bad acting is a GOOD thing in the low budget, corny horror movies), the dialogue is hilarious (the bad dialogue is a GOOD thing in the corny low budget horror movies) , the zombie rapist with a The huge cock is hilarious, the baby flying demon is hilarious and could go on and on and on, but I do not want to say much ... BUT I have to mention that there is a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex. Doll as if it were alive hahaha! Oh, and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol! <br /> <br /> The best lines of the film: <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * Smelled Coke * Detective Sloane: What? * Are you doing, manners? What the hell did you blow? What the hell is that? Detective Manners: it's nothing man, it's ... Ehh ... cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * heroin is injected into the arm * Detective Sloane: What the hell are you doing ? Manners? Are you * beep * crazy? Detective Manners: it's cold medicine. <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face * Detective Sloane: What the hell is going on, Manners? What are you doing? Detective Manners: This maniac was rambling on demons and then he began to crush his head against the rock! He just started crushing his head against the rock! I think it's on PCP or something! <br /> <br /> LOL!
