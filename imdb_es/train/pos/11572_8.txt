"In April 1946, the University of Chicago agreed to operate the Argonne National Laboratory, with a partnership of Midwestern universities that offered to sponsor the research, Argonne thus became the first" national "laboratory. Its original location in The Argonne Forest In 1947, it moved further west from "Windy City" to a new site on Illinois farmland.When Alvin Weinberg visited the Argonne director, Walter Zinn, in 1947, he He asked what kind of reactor would be built in When Zinn described a heavy water reactor that operates at one-tenth of the power of the Materials Testing Reactor designed at Oak Ridge, Weinberg joked that it would be simpler if Zinn took Oak Ridge's design and it will operate the Materials Testing Reactor in capacity of the tenth The joke turned out to be prophetic without intention ". <br /> <br /> The S-50 plant used convection to separate isotopes in thousands of tall columns. It was built next to the K-25 power plant, which provided the necessary steam. Much less efficient than K-25, the S-50 plant was demolished after the war. <br /> <br /> Concerned that the research program of the Atomic Energy Commission might be too academic, Lilienthal established a committee of industry advisers, and during a November visit to Oak Ridge, he discussed with Clark Center, manager Carbide & Carbon, a subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation in Oak Ridge, the possibility of the company assuming the administration of the Laboratory. <br /> <br /> Prince Henry (from Prussia) Upon arriving in Washington and visiting the German embassy (1902). Evidently, with Prince Henry of Prussia in accordance with the principles of science and its dangers, they were already preoccupied with the applications of the new science with military applications. The Hohenzollern (1902 / II), "the splendid yacht of Kaiser Wilhelm at 34th St. Pier, New York, taken at the exact moment of the arrival of Prince Henry and the elevation of the royal standard." If Royalty knew these necessary precautions for the welfare of the citizens, then what was the need for war, the First World War and the Second World War. The quality of management control, I suppose? <br /> <br /> Therefore, did Swallow Operation commandos volunteer for a military mission, or a business plan, based on the safety principles of the Laboratory administration? Because they were supposedly not survivors, and those who were trapped in Europe were ordered to be executed. From the 400-man command team, the survivors who were captured were executed under orders of the German Army against subversion and acts of espionage by the State of Germany. <br /> <br /> The number of Führer 003830/42 g.
