A well-made ghost story that will give you chills and will scare you a lot on the way. The story unfolds slowly, building an atmosphere until you're ready to see the woman in black. You will not forget it once you've seen it. No gore, no knives, no hockey masks, just a well-constructed story that looks better at night with the lights off.
