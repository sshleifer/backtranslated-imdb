I just attended a screening of the film during Expresion en Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. The film was shot and, from the first shot, I was amazed: a long and continuous shot of a futuristic Paris in glorious black and white. <br /> <br /> I should not continue with the details because I think it's a cinema worth seeing. The history of science fiction could be normal for many ... for me it was really good. The action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere and I mean everywhere. The things you could not do or see are achieved wonderfully. The performance of the cast is good, in my opinion nobody plays the wrong note. <br /> <br /> Now, what I thought was amazing is the animation. The 3D graphics are seen in 2D. A BW comic book brought to life. The details in the backgrounds give more texture as if it had been made by hand (I'm sure it was, but when the angles change, you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director, she said, is brilliant, but maybe he had no experience since he only had a short film on his CV. So, many people had true faith in them. They started their own study from scratch and since they faced the challenge that was presented to them. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. I think you will not regret it ... I think Richard Linklater for the final aspect of this film is superior to his.
