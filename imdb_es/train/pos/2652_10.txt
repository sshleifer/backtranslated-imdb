['Why can not more directors these days create horror films like &quot;The Shining&quot;? There is an easy answer to that: modern directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once and for all with this film that he is truly one of the best directors and authors of all time. <br /><br /> Therefore, the plot is quite simple. A man named Jack Torrance (brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson) and his family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over him during the off-season. The kicker is that the hotel&#39;s previous caretaker savagely murdered his wife and two girls. What follows can be easily summarized in the title of the film, but you have to see it to see what I mean. <br /><br /> This is the first movie in a long time that I find &quot;terrifying&quot;. It&#39;s about some seriously messy things, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the fear factor is the incredible music. Music has been an important part of the Kubrick films (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and it definitely does not disappoint with this. The score completely sets the tone and this movie would not be the same without it. <br /><br /> Finally, I must comment on the legendary performance of Nicholson. Jack is terribly convincing like a crazy killer. In fact, only his gaze steals some scenes from this movie. This is a first level performance that must be seen to be believed. <br /><br /> There will never be a horror movie that matches this one. RIP Stanley.']
