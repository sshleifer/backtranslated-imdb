One of the best low budget films in Germany! Is this the dark side of the new era? If you believe in esoteric, do not see this movie! blow all your positive fantasies away. This film shows that beyond the peaceful facade of the soul's spiritual search is a world of extreme transgressions and terror. I hope there will soon be a 35mm copy! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area, making films with a few euros! I'm waiting for the second blow!
