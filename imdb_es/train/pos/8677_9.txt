This movie seems to be well remembered as the time when Tom and Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for a while, but, as expected, they get bitter. Probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight that involves a pipe, a frying pan and a baseball bat in which the two more Butch, the dog, participate at the beginning and end of the short. I enjoyed one in a group and you should try to catch it on Cartoon Network.
