Although there were some difficult points and some lines of the plot that were not exactly faithful to the character, this was Classic H: LOTS. The characters, outside of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were true to form, and the gathering scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well acted as anything to adorn the screen little. <Br /> <br /> "Homicide: The Movie", also known as "Life Everlasting", is a movie for fans, but stands out on its own, as well as in any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job of pulling out 7-season loose ends and each major member of the cast of the "damn best television show" together for the end of the series that NBC never bothered to give him. True to the form of "Homicide", there were no happy endings, such is life. That is what has always differentiated this program from the police programs that have been left on television. Congratulations to the writers and the cast for creating something throughout the series and in the film that challenged viewers and producers alike. <br /> <br /> ** My name is "homicidal maniac" if not for anything else. reason to keep my co-workers in a cooperative environment. **
