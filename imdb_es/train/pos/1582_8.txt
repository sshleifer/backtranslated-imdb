Another small part of the vast picture puzzle of the Holocaust is presented face up in this docudrama about the Rosenstrasse protest in Berlin, an event that I did not know, which began at the end of February 1943. The details are given in an appendix that follows. this revision. <br /> <br /> The narrative of the film establishes the history of this protest within another contemporary history that begins in the city of New York, in the present. Here, a wealthy non-observant Jewish woman, whose husband has just died, surprises her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual. She goes even further, demanding that her daughter's non-Jewish fianc√©e leave the house. <br /> <br /> The anguished daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) then learns for the first time from a cousin older than during World War II, in Berlin. , his mother, who was then 8 years old, had been admitted and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah leaves everything, goes to Berlin and finds this woman, Lena Fischer, now 90 years old. Hannah easily convinces the woman to tell her story. Everything seems too good. <br /> <br /> The film thereafter improves, focusing on long flashbacks mainly in the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest, in which the fictional central character is the same as Mrs. Fischer at the time. 33 (played magnificently by Katja Riemann, a baroness and consummate pianist who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained at the Rosenstrasse site. <br /> <br /> Back to the present from time to time and also ends in New York City once again While the scenes in the present are saturated with color, the scenes of 1943 are erased, they are strong in shades of blue-gray. <br /> < The quality of the performance is generally quite good, which we could expect given the large pool of talent in Germany and under the direction of Margarethe von Trotta, the most prominent filmmaker of the New German Cinema, herself actress. <br / > <br /> The histo The ria of the protest is told in a simple way. All that's missing is a feature that could have helped: text notes without text at the end that indicate the final result for people detained in Rosenstrasse, a result that was, as indicated in the appendix below, incredibly positive. <br /> <br /> "Rosenstrasse" has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics. Too long, unnecessarily layered, provider of gender stereotypes, manipulated with music: so go the usual rhythms. It is very long. But I found in this film an austere, powerful, spontaneous and completely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil out of place in Rosenstrasse, where their Jewish relatives and others were arrested. I did not find anything striking, contemporary or manipulative in this description. <br /> <br /> The absence of extreme violence (no one is shot or brutally physically physically) intensified my tension, which gradually increased as the film progressed. You're still waiting for a vicious attack to start at any moment. The sadness of the movie stayed with me later. I woke up often later on the night I saw the movie, my mind was filled with grim, melancholy, chaotic images and feelings evoked by the film. For me, that happens rarely. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B +). (Seen on 05/31/05).

But before the deportation of prisoners could occur in this case, the wives and other relatives learned of what was happening and appeared in the direction of Rosenstrasse, first in one and two, and then in increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> Maybe up to six thousand participated in the protest, although not all at the same time. The women claimed their husbands, day after day, for a week. Disarmed, disorganized and without leaders, they faced the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, eager to have this racially cleansed city, was also in charge of the nation's public morals. In both cases, she was worried about the possible repercussions of women's actions. Instead of inviting more open dissidents by firing women into the streets and fearing to jeopardize the secret of the "Final Solution", Goebbels with the concurrence of Hitler freed the prisoners from Rosenstrasse and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them who had already been sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost all the freedmen of Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women won a surprising victory over the forces of destruction.
