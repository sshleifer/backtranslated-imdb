"If I sit down, I'll never get up again," that's what the mother (the title) tells her son when he tells her to rest (she's just a widow). It means that resting is what a woman of her age and in her situation has to do: rest in peace, neglect herself. But she is not in the mood to "rest", not yet. She also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disaster in her life ... Suddenly, the revelation arrives: sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the new James Bond) when she "thought that nobody would touch her again". It is a story that makes you think about many things, especially about what something a woman should do with her life when her husband dies. It does not seem that we have advanced so much in those aspects. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has a love story in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it was otherwise? An older woman, a young guy ... no, you're not ready for that, right? <br /> <br /> The film has intimate tones throughout its length, except for 2 or 3 sequences in which the tones are broken and some explicit and badly spoken dialogues come out. Those vulgar touches and the way in which the son and daughter discover their mother's love story (quite absurd, you'll know what I mean when you see it) are the only discordant elements in "The Mother". <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
