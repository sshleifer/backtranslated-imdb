Yes, it's a silly movie, so if you're looking for an Oscar performance, forget about it ... but, if you like John Candy's humor, this is a must. We lost John Candy before he earned enough from his great comedy brand, and he's only better in a movie: Planes, Trains, & Automobiles (with Steve Martin). Excellent support performance of Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work as Sal DiPasquale. Also good performance by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills and Pat Hingle. You must see this dark and exhausted movie if you are a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy.
