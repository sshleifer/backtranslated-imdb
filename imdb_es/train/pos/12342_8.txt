['The Sea is Watching was an interesting cinematic experience. In the first place, the general feeling was intense, internalized, claustrophobic and small. Each painting seemed to be a photograph of something inside, something very focused and not part of a larger image. It was obvious what we would see in each painting. The physicality of the whole contributed to that feeling of smallness and intensity. The lights along the middle of the road cut the road in half, and the small door to the small settlement followed by the tiny and few cubicles that served as establishments that formed what seemed to be the entire city. Even the view of the ocean was framed by a small landing in which one can count the amount of longer grass swayed by the wind. There are no panoramic views. In fact, it reminded me of the Moulin Rouge Montmarte sequence, where the camera focuses on the windmill, again creating the feeling of a small area where everything is happening. <br /><br /> While the performance was passable considering that I really could not discern how the lines were actually delivered, I felt that the actions were too melodramatic and meaningless. Why would Kikuno continue to advance as he did when Fusanosuke announced that his imminent marriage did not really seem true? The people really had not changed that much, and the Kikuno character was so strong and resilient that even if they were busy facing O-Shiny&#39;s business at all, the reaction seemed out of place and unnecessary and distracted. Another example of a strange performance was when Kikuno&#39;s drunken boyfriend appeared and Ryosuke decided to intervene and was pushed down the stairs, the way he got up and climbed threateningly up the stairs and the subsequent fight between the reeds was simply unsatisfactory. It&#39;s not that I like the fight scenes - au contraire - but it seemed a bit forced and again, too dramatic. <br /><br /> Otherwise, although it was not a beautiful movie to watch, it offered an interesting insight into the darker side of prostitution (unlike the geisha). Unfortunately, perhaps it fueled our expectations of indiscreet women (the comments &quot;supported by the exaggerated actions&quot; of &quot;honey, I&#39;ll give you a deal&quot;) and made me seriously doubt that nineteenth-century prostitutes really acted that way. But once inside the house, the internal works became more interesting, vivid and real and provided a scenario that I never imagined or imagined in my romantic vision of Japan in the 19th century.']
