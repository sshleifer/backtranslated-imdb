I can not believe some of the comments in this program! The show is just genius! Of course it does not follow the tried and true, but we, as consumers, always want the same things to push us again and again. Should not we have the option of sitting down and enjoying something new from time to time? The style is not as realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo" shows, but it is not supposed to be. The program titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue" indicates which part of that title states that the entire cast of other performances will be constantly attached to the action. And nowhere does he say that they would be solving mysteries, and they can not even stand monsters, so why would they? In fact, I'm glad they've put some long-established plot points that work in a Scooby-Doo show. They still have jokes, clumsy jokes, quick-change suits in the chase scenes, the standard corridor gag and even Scooby's sandwiches. In fact, I'm glad that this program is there, because I love it. I'm even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on just two main characters and a villain. <br /> <br /> Of course it's ridiculous, it's supposed to be! Of course it's different, it's supposed to be. It's supposed to make you laugh at the villain and encourage the robotic butler idiot to triumph over all the intruder bugs, regardless of size. You're supposed to get the "Roobi-Roo" joke. Everything has just been put together so well, there is not one thing I can think is EVIL. Writing, acting, animation, everything first class. The title of the music is amazing (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!" When it starts), and the background music is simply exciting.
