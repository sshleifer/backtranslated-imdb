I saw this movie in the theater, and it really impressed me. On the other hand, that was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the silly, arrogant and Hollywood bitch she is today. Anyway, this movie really seemed like one of the most beautiful, realistic and beautiful movies of friendship. How far would you go for your best friend? It moved me to tears at the end, and I keep crying when I see it now (I have it). I remember that when I left the theater, I called my best friend and I cried how much I loved her. This is a great movie to watch with your best girlfriend. However, be prepared for the almost certain conversation after she turns to you and asks you if you would do something like that for her ...
