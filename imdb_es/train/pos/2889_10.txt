*** I might not consider this as having a spoiler, but I'd rather be cautious than careless. *** I never saw this movie when I was little. I fell in love with him the first time I saw him with my three-year-old daughter. I can see it again and again. <br /> <br /> For the little performance of Ilene Woods in her life, it was a wonderful voice for Cinderella; very attractive; very believable The music really fits perfectly with the movie. The performance was great; I loved the mice! You really "hated" Lady Tremain and the stepsisters; They were just horrible. The cartoonists described the pampered behavior very well. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, especially if you like love stories. My daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and is still excited at the end.
