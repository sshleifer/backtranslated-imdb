An excellent movie with great performances by Zack & Lochley. To his displeasure (and mine), Garibaldi arrived at the station. (With all due respect to Jerry Doyle, but in Seasons 4 and 5 I lost my sympathy for the character). It does not take him long to start criticizing Zack (whom I love more than anyone in the program) and to take charge. I'm sure Zack could have done it. The plot of Soulhunter is fascinating, especially if you believe in heaven as Zack does. Humor complements it very well. 10/10
