This is an old-fashioned, wonderfully funny children's movie, with the most attractive new witch of all. Unlike many modern stories that seem to delight in dark witchcraft, this is simply a magical hocus pocus tale that is cute, cheerful and charming. <br /> <br /> The story goes back to 1940 in the English town. from Peppering Eye, where three cockney kids, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins, are being evacuated out of danger from air strikes from the city of World War II. They are mistakenly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence to become a witch's apprentice. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob to travel to London in their flying bed. Here they meet Emilius Browne, the fraudulent director of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school. Miss Price is dedicated to working on spells designed to give life to inanimate objects. Meanwhile, they must also deal with a somber character called The Bookman and his partner, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Of course, Angela Lansbury is wonderfully captivating like the eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, director of the defunct witchcraft school, who has now become a street magician. This actor was previously chosen as the father of children in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this movie is a story that reminds a lot of Mary Poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. Maybe this movie does not have music as memorable as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it does have some attractive melodies. Some have been critical, but the film presents excellent special effects. All in all, the story is a lovely family entertainment. It is a pity that modern children are too sophisticated for this charming and fascinating tale, which should attract the child in all of us.
