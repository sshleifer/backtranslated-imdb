Films of coming of age are quite common these days. For 1980, "Foxes" really gives its meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character directly. Since he made "Taxi Driver" four years earlier, he has a stronger character in this movie. She is Jeanie, a high school student who has many guts, and seems to get out of whatever situation she is in. Scott Baio plays Brad long before Chachi in "Happy Days". He is considered immature by the other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, she hangs with the wrong crowd, pursued by her policeman's father. Jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party gets out of hand. Exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be fun or dangerous. Annie is rescued by Jeanie and Brad all the time every time they waste it. Reality returns with force where it dies in a car accident. And one marries a much older man. Growing up is not easy, sometimes we have to explore life as it is. Actually, you must be careful with the people around you. For me, I was my own person, and I tend to stay that way! Good music, great plot, this movie is a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
