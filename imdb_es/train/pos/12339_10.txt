Joan beloved Great performance. In what is not right. I saw this movie and then Jane Eyre right after ... she keeps getting better. My heart was racing. Great drama of old movies. Just what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the entire movie. I'm glad to have it on video. I do not know what else you need in a movie. Beautiful woman ... wealth ... greed ... murder ... detectives ... a trial ... <br /> <br /> The costumes are very beautiful. I wonder what was the budget for this movie? I wish they still made movies like this one. Every time they try they seem to make a corny movie. The black and white films still hold some mystery.
