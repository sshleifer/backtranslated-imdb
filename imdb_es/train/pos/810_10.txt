This is probably the best of all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The starting point of the film was almost like Episode IV: spacious cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret venue, where the seriousness of mobster Jabba the Hutt was becoming even more serious. He ordered Luke to die in a pit in the basement because of Bantha's crushing teeth, which looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. Luke's Jedi powers finally kill the monster. Adding to the cunning rescue of Han Solo, who was frozen alive at the end of Episode V, Jabba was very angry about this because Luke was sentenced to die in the Sarlacc pit outside. <br /> <br /> But all the "good guys" of Star Wars, especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and those other ideas defended themselves from the execution of Luke; in the end, most of Jabba's soldiers died and Princess Leia was able to use force to fatally smother Jabba. <br /> <br /> As in Episode IV, the Death Star in Episode VI makes its appearance. While analyzing the rebel fleet attacking the Imperial fighters around the Death Star, Star Destroyer personnel, I assumed, accelerated the main laser's arming, using the Imperial fighters as a detour. The 20-25 Star Destroyers that lined up were ready to attack, but were canceled and instead the laser weapon on the Death Star was fired by surprise. Once it was fired, the only hope of the rebel fleet was that the deflector shield of the Death Star was going to be eliminated, and this affected Lando because he wanted to destroy the Death Star but could not do it until he was pulled out The shield. And it was eliminated with the growing impatience of Lando. <br /> <br /> As in Episode V, the Imperial Walkers make their threatening appearance with their twin cannons, killing at least one of the Ewoks ... but the Ewoks found ancient However, an unusual way to treat with them. For example, Chewbacca, like another Ewok, was able to control one of the walkers (and actually used it to destroy him from behind one of the walkers), and the other Ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers. <Br /> <br /> It's amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi powers in his Light Saber, like, for example, the scene in Endor where Luke deflects the laser shots of a Storm Trooper bike, and uses Knowledge to knock out. part of the bike. Or, at a climax, use Saber to break the arm of his own father during the last fight Knowing with Sith Vader. <br /> <br /> You probably know the celebration of the Ewoks after the Death Star exploded, complete with a brief display of fireworks, drumming on the spoils of victory (eg, Storm Trooper Masks), and Luke finally meets Leia after Luke's own nemesis: Darth Vader, now dead, burns himself on a pyre. The celebration includes Ewoks singing, but I think Lucas did not buy it, even with the great respect of film composer John Williams. <br /> <br /> In the version of the home movie, I think Lucas himself wanted a different ending. In addition to the celebration at Endor, I wanted footage of celebratory scenes on several surviving rebellious planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the Sith. The Ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. He probably wanted additional things to prove that with the destruction of the Death Star, the balance in rebellious galaxies had been restored.
