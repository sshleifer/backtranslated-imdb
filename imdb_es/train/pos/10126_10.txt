Much has been said about the Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true "Miike" movie and I thought that this kind of description could have been a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All of Miike's trademarks are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo tests and the difficult central character to like. Shinjuku is, however, one of Miike's best-formed films. He says in an interview that if he did it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film has a really captivating energy and a raw edge that seems so recent that, although it could be able to capture a more complex film from the visual or technical point of view, it could not replicate or improve the purity of this movie. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the violence is completely visceral, the blood gushing out and the sandy beatings are complemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a shattered chair in her face. (Only a movie by Miike could let you escape with a sentence like that). The film has a fantastic rhythm, unlike Dead or Alive, which starts and ends strongly and submerges in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar topics, Miike is clearly concerned about the relationship between Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotional theme is handled well here, the central character really comes alive when you begin to understand his past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing Shinjuku's praises enough. I do not want to give too much. This is Miike before you start using CGI to animate your movies and almost remember something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are extraordinarily realized and the final turn guarantees that as soon as the movie is finished, you will put it back to solve everything.
