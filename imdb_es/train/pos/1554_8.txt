I saw this in the theater in the early 70's. The most memorable and terrifying scene is when the German army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with strange protective suits. Experienced British soldiers put on gas masks (alone) and once again await the gas clouds and the German attackers. The gas clouds get closer and closer and finally envelop the British defenders. The Germans advance slowly menacingly in their frightening-looking attire. Suddenly, a cry from the defenders ... This gas does not look like any other that you have experienced before ... <br /> <br /> Now you will know why I have remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still chill, I think you will too!
