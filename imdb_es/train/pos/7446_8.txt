I do not agree with any of the comments. The first time I saw the film on a UK television channel, it was presented as an independent film and, if the film is taken from this angle, I think it is a totally different matter. I could not believe what I was seeing and I was instantly hooked. The plot can be as bad as a JS program (that is, there is no plot) but the performance is perverse, it is hilarious and, in general, it is an incredible garbage movie. <br /> <br /> It says much more about the United States than a Bully or a Ken Park without the perspective of the drama, but it gives a glimpse into the society of the United States and, more precisely, the afternoon of the viewers in United States (and I think there are many of them interested!) After all, we're talking about neighbors, right? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
