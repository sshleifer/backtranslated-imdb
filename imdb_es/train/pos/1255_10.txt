This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are playing this movie? I'll tell you. In this movie, you have a black criminal who mocks a white teacher. A black policeman who tells the white professor that he is wrong in defending the black criminal and that the black policeman is right, therefore. Making the white teacher look stupid. It always comes down to the race. This is an excellent movie. Do not pay attention to the racist. If you can overcome that, there are characters that are played by blacks in this movie who are more cunning than whites, so you should not have any problem to enjoy this movie. I recommended everyone to go see this movie.
