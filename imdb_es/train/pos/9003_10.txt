<br /> <br /> I guess this is not the best movie ever made, but I voted it with 10 stars anyway. Mainly because of my feelings at the end. I and all the people around me were simply touched. This is something that is not often felt. We are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern movies. The story of the film centers around Jane, a young woman in the last stages of the NME and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of a crisis. This could have been so easily a boring and dignified piece, but it is so humorous, humane and lacking in sentimentality that you win completely and against all odds is a good movie. <br /> <br /> The performance of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is excellent, especially the latter, which is always credible and strong in its role. The chemistry between the two also raises the film. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richards' masterpiece, an airplane made of garbage and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes live life to the fullest so that one can continue and the other can face the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend to anyone. Do not let the subject discourage you.
