Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi star in "Anchors Aweigh," directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two men from the Navy who are leaving Hollywood. They meet a small child (Dean Stockwell) and when they take him home, they meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls in love with her. She wants an audition for Jos√© Iturbi. They try to help, but there is confusion. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical with a great dance and singing by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly starts dancing with Jerry the Mouse in a lovely sequence. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings. It's not one of my favorite voices, but she's doing well. The piano work of Iturbi is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra shows his versatility and why the girls fainted on him, with those big blue eyes and his youthful face. For Kelly, this was a great opportunity for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> Wonderful movie, very optimistic.
