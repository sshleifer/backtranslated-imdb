David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young couple of journalists who want to go to California, but can not afford to do so, so they "share" with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save on expenses . The idea is for them to stop at several murder sites along the way, places where the serial killers did their thing, since Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they do not know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis is a serial killer and a girlfriend who simply agrees with whatever he says. I do not care about Pitt as a general rule, but he does justice to psycho roles. What is scary is that it does them so well; like him before, no, not murderers, but with the same mentality. Anyway, as the trip progresses, Carrie guesses that the others are for lack of money, but Earley seems to always come up with the money somehow ... ..it does not matter that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it. Lewis plays his role that we, one in which he excels, a not very bright wife who has a good heart but does not understand that he does not have to endure that Earley hit her when she does something she does not like. As things become more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple be put in a gas station, and unfortunately it is at that point where she is inside that she sees a newsletter that tells her exactly who they have shared the trip with. after which things go downhill for them at a rapid pace. This is not the best movie in the world, but it's not bad ... I saw what was supposed to be the "unrated" version, but I wonder how much was removed from the classified version, because I thought it was quite insensitive. really ... it's not like this is a family meal or something, unless it's maybe the Manson Family. 7 out of 10
