For the project of my humanities room for the school, I chose to traffic people. After some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished seeing it and I'm still thinking about it. All I can say is: Wow. "It's such a compelling story about a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric trying to save her.The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happy ending forever It's very realistic, it's amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks for her and for what happens to her, I loved it and now I want to know what happens next!
