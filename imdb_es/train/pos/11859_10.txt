In the MTV cribs, all dancers and shooters release the classic Scarface movie from their DVD collection. This may give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Sure, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but that's not Scarface's point. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban refuge seeking a new way of life. He falls into the mafia group and becomes a known drug trafficker. Montana was all about doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Say hello to my little friend!" He's in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think of Brian DePalmas' film, Scarface. This falls under my 10 best favorite movies. I would rate it *** 1/2 (from ****). Definitely a movie that you should see. PHENOMENAL.
