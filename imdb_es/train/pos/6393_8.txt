This is a must-see for fans of independent films, but it also resists conventional films well. I think we have the ingredients of the next Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> The budget is extremely low. It has no special effects at all, and apparently used ambient lighting (filmed in digital video). And yet, this movie catches him and never abandons him. The script is strange, but the actors and the director achieve it with total realism. It has humor, it has intrigue and it has pathos, and everything works together. <br /> <br /> There is no point in describing the details. If you want to see an independent masterpiece <br /> <br />, a virtual lesson on how to make a low-budget movie that really works, check out this one. <br /> <br /> -Oh, yes, also REALLY entertaining. <br /> <br />
