The best movie about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection for couples who will arrive at the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision could be the best or the worst in our lives and the lives of our children. The real intrusion or help of 'friends' - or executioner if we leave -. The true role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. The crazy priest who may not be very angry telling what could happen according to statistics and reality. A couple who thinks of a 'special' marriage, lives a painful story in their own future history. <br /> <br /> Who likes marriage by contract? Nobody, after the priest tells his own story? if they leave the future in other hands, if they do not know WHAT is marriage. That the problems are true, that life demands a real commitment, guarantees, from each one. That the real victims of divorce are children, with a real name? Andrea in the movie or names. That abortion is only an easy way out: sadness, regret and unhappiness will be there after the abortion. That the state and social security think less and less about a real problem of families. The gossip of the "friends", the infidelity due to the weakness and the desperation of Steffania because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might think that this movie is a pessimistic movie, but no. Steffania and Tomasso, deep in their hearts, like a beautiful marriage and their family, if not, why do they like marriage? A true and beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: on each of their decisions, on each of the actions in their lives. The family could be a place where each one feels loved because it is his, only existing. The script is wonderful. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, the almost cynical priest! An excellent address and script. The colors and the management of the cameras, excellent.
