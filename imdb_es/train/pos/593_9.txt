This game program lasted only one season, but it was intriguing to the public because it required visual aptitude and a firm hand. A false move would disqualify the participant to win the prize, although it was clear that the participant knew the correct answer. It was always exciting when the contestant began to draw, wondering if they would complete the drawing or be expelled; allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest. It was a happy show, but it was clear that the contestants often felt embarrassed by a silly mistake made involuntarily. Rarely seen, the game program did not survive beyond a single season. Only an addict to a game show will remember this program, as it turned out to be quite unpopular, even though the game shows were making a great return to the television screen after the scandals of the game shows of the fifties . But it was a unique concept for a game show, and one that has not yet been seen again.
