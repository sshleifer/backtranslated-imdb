I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and I've watched all the episodes. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for Nickelodeon to arrive, however, when Sabrina left high school, the show started going downhill. The best series has to be when she was Valerie's friend (I'm not sure what it is). From there, the next series (friends with Dreama) was still very good, but when she left high school it did not seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that she did not have most of the "glow", however, the first series in which Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and visible, however, when her aunt is Goes and Sabrina leaves. At home, it's just not right. She is no longer a teenager, therefore, the name of the program is not correct and without Hilda, Zelda and Josh the program does not seem right, especially when Sabrina almost marries someone who is not Harvey. Thank God he arrived in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. In general, I still love watching the old episodes of Sabrina, the Teen Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina coming out of high school. Because after that the show definitely lost some of its magic.
