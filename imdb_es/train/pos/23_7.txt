Granted, the musical pieces were poorly written and, in general, badly sung (although Walken and Marner, particularly Walken, sounded pretty good). And so they broke the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the "battle" with the ogre, and praised the efforts of Puss in Boots when, by rights, they should not even have known it. /> <br /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, making a movie based on a fairy tale, and he sings and dances. His acting style adapts very well to the role of the wicked and mischievous Puss, who seems to lead his teacher to deeper and deeper problems, but in reality he has a plan that he thought with seven or eight moves in advance. And if you've ever seen Walken in any of his villainous roles, * you know * the ogre bit the HARD dust at the end when Walken put him in his trap. <br /> <br /> A fun movie and a must-see for anyone who enjoys the unique style of Christopher Walken.
