It is fun. It has a great cast that each one gives great performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It's a well-written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I do not like soap operas, although I never see them. But I love this movie because it's crazy and out of control, which surpasses any stupid soap they have on daytime television. In my opinion, it is the best movie of 1991.
