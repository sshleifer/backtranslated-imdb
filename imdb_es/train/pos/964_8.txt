"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's movie by Takashi Miike, but as expected, it is probably too dark and terrifying for the younger ones. However, older children may well eat this, that is, if you play it folded in English. <br /> <br /> The story is that of a child who has moved with his mother to the country to live. With his grandfather, after a divorce. During a festival in a village, the child is chosen as a "Kirin rider", a great honor, but with that honor comes a lot of danger and adventure, of course. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, bad actions are at hand as a woman. In a white mini skirt, go-go boots and a beehive hairstyle, she joins an evil Yokai to turn the resentments of the people and the discarded items against her. And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that goes to the City of Wrath in Tokyo. A very funny scene has two negligent watching the monster fly over the city ... one says: "Oh, it's only Gamera". <br /> <br /> The young man has become friends with Yokai, who are class monsters, mostly benign, who have been isolated from humans, and all the Yokai in Japan come together to fight evil . <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike and his team have taken the Yokai films from the late 60s and early 70s and turned them into a modern action and adventure film for (older) children. It also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of "Transformers". The appearance of the film is excellent, the effects are entertaining and part of the humor will simply slide over the heads of the children, but even so, the older ones can enjoy it. As for adults, here is not much you do not like, if you are a fan of Japanese monster movies, you will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> Cool and funny things, a little dark sometimes But maybe it's just Miike ... and what a wilder ride. 8 out of 10.
