This movie took my breath away at some points, I just loved it! <br /> <br /> I admit that the dialogues and the story of the characters could have been made a little better, but hey, this is just a simple (short) story of a couple of guys trying to kill a dragon, there is nothing else. thereto! <br /> <br /> The general design, the atmosphere, the beautiful landscapes ... everything is simply magical! <br /> <br /> They've put a lot of love into this movie. The character designs were great and fun. A little Tim Burton-ish if you want. I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in a great design, which shows in a small but charming story.
