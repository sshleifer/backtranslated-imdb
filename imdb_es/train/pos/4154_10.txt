This was one of the best episodes of all time. Officer Sean Cooper was killed in his patrol car in '68. A dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting. His case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman. <br /> <br /> Additional research about him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love. This type of love was considered shameful and something that at least should be hidden at that time. <br /> <br /> While this is not the kind of love that I personally support, he was still a policeman and a human being and should not do it. They have not been killed for it. The sound track was excellent (it keeps me watching the DVR), and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize an object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially attractive. I'll be seeing this repeated!
