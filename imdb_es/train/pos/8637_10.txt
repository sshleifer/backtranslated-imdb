"Kalifornia" is a great movie that makes us see ourselves. The film has a great cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A River Runs Through It and The Legends Of The Fall) as Early Grayce, David Duchovny (The X Files) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Homicide: Life On The Street, and Escape From LA) as Carrie Loughlin, the girlfriend of Brian and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape) as Adele Corners, Early's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a writer who is a liberal, he is preparing to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend, Carrie, decide they want to move to California. , then Brian places an ad in the university for some who want to go to California, to share the travel expenses. <br /> <br /> Early Grayce is an ex-convict and sociopath on probation, who recently lost his job at The Mirror Factory in the city, is in debt, owes money to the owner. The Early probation officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job. Lege and see the ad, he later tells Adele, his girlfriend about going to California. Early and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave the city. Brian and Carrie do not know that he is a murderer who has just killed his friend. Owner. For a moment, Brian and Carrie thought of different Early and Adele, but they got to know them and they became friends, Carrie and Adele became good friends. <br /> <br /> Your trip is very learning. Although Brain and Carrie do not know it from the start it is a killer until later in the movie. The question Brian asks in this movie about the difference between us and the killers is a very good question. Early Grayce is a sociopath who does not see the error of His ways, goes downhill later and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up. I love the songs of the film, especially in The end of the movie, the song "Look Up To The Sky" by The Indians.
