"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the funniest dialogues in recent memory. Seeing this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us maybe of another movie we had seen in the past, but since we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to discover that what we remembered was the 1958 movie Italian "Big Deal on Madonna Street", directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Russo brothers formed a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, can not be bad. Since this is a piece of set, all the characters have the opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The movie presents us with a group of crackers from hell. No one could think that these men could perform a job like the one they perform. Anything that can go wrong, and more, is what they manage to do. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master cracker sure is also seen posing as a rabbi, only to be confused with a priest by the members of the gang who leave the funeral of Cossimo. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these little time criminals do their thing. Let your funny lines make you laugh, as anyone can see, this gang is doomed from beginning to end!
