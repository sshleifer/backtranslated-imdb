Great actors, an Oscar-nominated actress, amazing landscapes, a solid and good story and more laughter than you can put in my new bag (and that's pretty big). This movie was brilliant. He acted beautifully in the most serious scenes and the funny moments. Well, lateral division. I had never heard a film audience laugh so much, and tears ran down my cheeks during the scene of the 'drugged ladies in the tea shop'. Well done to the British film industry and to Craig Ferguson, whose magical ingredients have ensured that this is one of my favorite films of the year, if not of all times.
