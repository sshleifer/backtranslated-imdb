I enjoyed capturing this film on television at the end of the finals and kept my interest in the whole image. This wonderful and spooky, but mysterious English house, with decorations of bad aspect and furniture and rooms that make you think why someone would want to rent this house or even have it. There are four (4) stories related to this house, and every resident of the house encounters all sorts of problems. You will notice the beautiful lake and the pond around the house and also the sweet song of the birds, but do not let that deceive you, there is horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", '80 gives a great performance as one of the people living at home and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of the Crimson Altar", 68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks, (Jane Reid) They make a wonderful and exciting story together, their daughter for some reason loves to read WITCHCRAFT BOOKS. If you like scary, horrible and mysterious movies, with many surprises, this is the MOVIE FOR YOU !!!!
