What can be said about Elvira that has not already been said in the world press? The classic comedian that IS Elvira presents in his first big budget comedy masterpiece. <br /> <br /> From the first film of the cinema, Elvira has a punching performance that clearly says "Great movie" ... eat your Â¡Fuera, Bette Davis! Go to a sad Elvira, see an excited Elvira, see a jealous Elvira, see a murderous Elvira. You can not do anything but marvel at his ability to act! <br /> <br /> At the heart of this comedy, the masterpiece is Elvira's desire for the stardom of the show in Las Vegas. Despite putting "the boob back on the boobtube" as a flight attendant (with the largest number), Elvira finds the small screen emotionally constrictive ... and PHYSICALLY! Nuff said, he packs his backpack and heads east ... a hot dog in one hand and a letter from his aunt's attorney describing his "windfall" inheritance in the other. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times, I can almost literally recite it ... (literally it would just be showing)! <br /> <br /> Grab a copy, laugh silly, learn the lines ... <br /> <br /> Why she did not win the Oscar for best actress for this role exceeds me.
