As a big fan of Prince for the last three or four years, I really can not believe I just saw "Purple Rain". The new Special Edition of 2 anniversary albums led me to buy it. Wow, I really wanted to see it, but I was not prepared for the electric that is really. Prince's musical performances throughout the film are amazing: he REALLY has the moves in this one. I am very familiar (by repeated listening) with the classic album "Purple Rain" and all its songs, but seeing them in the context of the film completely alters your perception of melodies and lyrics, such as COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, WHEN CRUISES AND PURPLE RAIN ARE FOUND. There is something indescribably hypnotizing in the scenes in which Prince and The Revolution act. The closing songs BABY I'M A STAR and I WOULD DIE FOR U show us how much energy and talent that Prince was overflowing in his mid-20s (it's overflowing!), I was surprised. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years. <br /> <br /> Prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams: take her to a lake, make her jump, then get out, absolutely hilarious things in retrospect. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very 1980s and, unintentionally, they are very funny, but this adds to the general charm of the film. Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block (and fun), and when his band The Time plays THE BIRD, you can watch Morris Day and Jerome Benton light the stage in the Minneapolis funk style: I love the way you dance in this bit, and how Benton gives Morris a mirror of average performance. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see him again, I really can not! The extras are fabulous, especially when you see a young Eddie Murphy, before Beverly Hills Cop, admit that he is a "Prince groupie".
