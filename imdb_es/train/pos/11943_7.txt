I am a big fan of Woody Allen and, when I saw that I was playing in the movies, I could not help it. I wanted to see how Allen would continue his magnificent movie Match Point since this is another of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen's work) along with what appears to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and humor is the most pleasant aspect of Scoop. The plot revolves around the character of Johanson (a journalism student) who receives a suggestion about a burning story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with an alleged serial killer (Jackman) and must decide if it is worth pursuing the truth. Oh, and all this is done with the help of a clumsy wizard turned into a detective played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I must say that I really enjoyed Johanson's performance, but I'm a little skewed, I could watch a three-hour video. Film with Johanson in each painting and you're delighted. She plays a ditsy, yappy, clumsy girlfriend who is a kind of variation in the character of Allen's stereotyped neurosis character. Add appropriate body language for the comic effect. Needless to say, almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character disgustingly cute and that's an advantage. <br /> <br /> Allen is Allen ... He is still playing the same character as Chaplin and his character Little Tramp. However, something that happens in this movie makes me wonder if I will see the little neurotic hypochondriac again. He is not in the cast of his next photo and has spent more time exclusively behind the camera in recent times ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also nice as the murder suspect, millionaire and suave. I can not say that Jackman does something in particular to play his role, but he adapts to his character anyway. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, I can not help but feel that this is new ... In fact it stinks the Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more like detectives than anything else. However, I must congratulate Allen for his finale, as he is a bit smarter than the version of this exceptional Hollywood movie. Instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being totally innocent has nothing to do with it and has no unequivocal guilt. Even though the plot seemed old, Woody still has a special ability for a line. I found his allusions to his latest movie interesting ... Come for the humor, laugh and be happy. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you like Allen's work, enjoy it. If you do not look at something else ...
