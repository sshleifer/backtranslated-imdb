The great talents of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger are remarkable in their wonderful "A Matter of Life and Death". It was part of the recent tribute to Mr. Powell who played at the Walter Reade in New York. This film, in particular, shows us one of the best British films of that time, or any other era. <br /> <br /> "A Matter of Life and Death" has a brilliant picture of Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to do wonders with a camera. Particularly impressive is the contrast of the monochromatic tones given to the scenes reproduced in the sky and the colors when the action returns to the earth. This was a coup d'etat, and well ahead of its times. The black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where Peter and the Conductor are talking is one of the most surprising things in any movie. <br /> <br /> Much has been said in this forum about the film, so our comment will be about the great performance that Powell and Pressberger got from the big and distinguished cast, who responded magnificently to the guidance of the directors. <br /> <br /> David Niven, is Peter, whose plane is impacted and his best Friend version dies as a result. This film marked one of the highlights in Mr. Niven's career. He was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie. Kim Hunter is surprisingly good as June, the woman who spoke to Peter as his plane fell from the skies. As fate would, Peter and June fall in love at first sight. <br /> <br /> Some of the best British film actors adorn this movie with their presence. Robert Coote, is Bob, the man who is admitted to heaven, but is surprised that his friend Peter has never made the trip with him. An excellent change of star of Marius Goring, who as Driver 71 steals the film. Mr. Goring, who had worked with the directors, is one of the best things in the movie. In addition, Roger Livesey, like Dr. Frank Reeves, makes one of the best appearances of his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who is seen as Abraham Farlan. <br /> <br /> "A matter of life and death" It is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude towards its creators.
