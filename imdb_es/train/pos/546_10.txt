I thought it was one of the best sequels I've seen in a long time. Sometimes I felt like I wanted someone to die, Stanley's murder of the annoying characters was brilliant. It was such a well-made movie that you were happy when they died. My only problem was that in some scenes it seemed that someone with a domestic camera was filming it and it was strange. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Bright movie
