This movie of three nuts is in a tie with my other favorite movie "Disorder in the Court". This is a riot of laughter for fans of Three Stooges to enjoy. <br /> <br /> The boys are janitors in a recording studio when they hear that the lovely Christine McIntyre sings a great version of "Voices of Spring". She will be offered a recording contract, but is marked by being honest with her father about her career choice and showing that she is a true singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the puppets decide to have a little fun and play their record and dress up Curly as Christine. The hired woman who can do Christine's career, sees Curly and confuses her with Christine and invites Curly to sing for her party. Of course, there is a man who is upset at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd, so he will find a way to get back with them. <br /> <br /> What a great puppet movie, this is not to be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
