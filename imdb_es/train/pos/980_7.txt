['The summary of the previous line, spoken by James Cloud (Robert Preston) to his brother Tom (Robert Sterling) almost says it all. Jim, also known as Kid Wichita, has a way of making things happen, the only problem is that he usually leaves the corpses where he has been. It&#39;s not the kind of mentoring that Tom foresees for younger brother Jeff, who likes what he sees in Jim, especially when defending his ranch against local Texas ranchers. <br /><br /> Initial credits state that &#39;We present John Barrymore Jr. as the younger brother&#39;, in this his first screen appearance. That seemed strange to me, especially since they approached him as Jeff almost immediately in the story. Approximately eighteen at the time of this movie, he looks a lot like Sean Penn. No stranger to the personal and legal problems throughout his career, as well as the estrangement from his family, I was wondering if his daughter Drew Barrymore could have seen this picture. I am inclined to think not. <br /><br /> On the subject of similarities, I was also impressed by the idea that the young Robert Sterling looked a bit like Roy Rogers at the beginning of his career. Knowing Sterling previously just for his role as George Kerby in the &#39;Topper&#39; television series of the 1950s, I thought he looked out of place in a Western, but that could be me. His character is encouraged by his brother&#39;s ingenuity to create problems, and provides some of the uneasiness to this not-so-typical story. Minor subplots abound, including the relationship that farmer John Gall (John Litel) has with his son, the Sheriff (whom Kid Wichita kills), and the troubled marriage between Kathleen Boyce (Cathy Downs) and her husband Earl (whom Kid Wichita kills). Chill Wills rounds out the main cast as one of the contracted hands of Tom Cloud, and appears somewhat predictable in the end. <br /><br /> What is not entirely predictable is how things end up getting there, and for that reason, this Western wins points for following a plot so little traveled, so it is not as formulated as many of the Westerns of good / bad- brothers. Combined with the directors&#39; eclectic casting, it is one I would recommend, even if it has to withstand some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing I experienced with my copy.']
