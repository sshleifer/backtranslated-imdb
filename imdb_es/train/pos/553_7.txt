After losing his herd of cattle to a dishonest law enforcer, a trailhead ends up in the Yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and little chance of returning to the United States. While there, their fortunes turn towards the best until a spectrum of bad luck from the past arrives. Good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup.
