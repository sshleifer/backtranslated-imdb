I really liked that movie. I knew it would be full of camps and nonsense like the original series. I found it very comforting to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar, all together again. Anyone who loves the Batman series of the 60s should have enjoyed Return to the Batcave. You could say that the actors had a lot of fun doing this movie, especially Adam West. And I bet he'd gladly put on his Batman costume again if the script demanded he do it. I told a number of friends about this movie that they chose not to see her ... now they wished they had seen her. I have all 120 original episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection. Thanks for the meeting of Adam and Burt.
