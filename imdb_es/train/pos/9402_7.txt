I watched this movie only after hearing praise about it for years. Needless to say, the actual experience was a bit anticlimactic. But still, Alec Guiness leads energetically to a wonderful cast in a cheery, if well formulated, through the post-World War II industrial industry in England. <br /> <br /> This is the family tale of the evils of inventing the perfect daily product. Remember the car that runs on water? Do you remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wear, wrinkle or get dirty. Of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being left out of business, so the plot gets a bit complicated. <br /> <br /> Guiness makes the whole company worthwhile, and seeing it explode. The factory research lab again and again is a wonder! (Those Britons ... always have a rigid upper lip when they're under fire). The film could appear exactly like the ridiculous invention of Guinness, but it's a good walk anyway.
