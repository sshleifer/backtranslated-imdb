['I usually try to avoid science fiction movies as much as I can, because this is not a genre that really attracts me. Lightsabers, UFOs, aliens, time travel ... most of the time it&#39;s nothing to me. However, there is a movie in the genre where I will always give a place on my list of the best movies and it is this &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot;. I remember that I was completely surprised the first time, but even now, after having it. Already seen several times, I&#39;m still one of his biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to improve and improve. <br /><br /> Somewhere in the distant future, all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus eliminated five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1% of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He is a prisoner who lives in a small cage and is chosen as a &quot;volunteer&quot; to be sent on time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They think it was spread by a mysterious group called &quot;The Twelve Monkeys&quot; and they need the virus before it mutates, so scientists can study it. But his time travel machine does not work perfectly and is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the crazy son of a famous scientist and virus expert ... <br /><br /> What I really like about this movie is the fact that it&#39;s never clear if everything you&#39;re seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does it really come from the future and can it really travel through time? Was the population really eliminated by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? These are all the questions that will leave you thinking from the beginning to the end. If the creators of this film had opted for everything to be more obvious, I am sure that I would never have liked it as much as now. It&#39;s just that mystery that keeps me interested again and again. But that&#39;s not the only good thing about this movie, of course. The performance is also incredible. Normally, I&#39;m not too big a Bruce Willis fan, but what he did in this movie was amazing. Along with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt, he should have won several awards for it, because along with the incredible story, they made this movie work so incredibly well. <br /><br /> Even after several presentations, I&#39;m still a big fan of this movie. Except for this movie, I&#39;ve only seen another Terry Gilliam movie and it&#39;s &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, which was not bad, but it did not convince me either. However, it is this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. I give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5 / 10.']
