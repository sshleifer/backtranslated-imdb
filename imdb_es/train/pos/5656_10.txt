I could never remember the name of this show. I used to see it when I was 8 years old. I remember that I stayed late when I did not have to to see this show. It was the best show for me. From what I remember of that, it's still great. This showed Lucas Black starring him as the first boy I had ever fallen in love with. I am from the country, therefore, the accent guys do not attract me, but for him I would definitely make an exception. That after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift you should see why. He is a great actor and has been since he was a child. I miss this show and I want it to come out again. If someone sees where the season is selling, please send me an email. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
