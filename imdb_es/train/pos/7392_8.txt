['I really like this movie. He has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is quite universal, the story of the prodigal son. However, the aspect I like the most is the way the bathhouse was more than a background for the story. When the father told the son the story of his wife&#39;s family in the deserts of northern China, the element of water and bath becomes an almost sacred ritual. The water was so scarce that a simple bath had depth and meaning. <br /><br /> In general, the film was very effective. There were moments, however, when he approached the &quot;too&quot; sweet ... bordering point of draft during the scene of the park recital. But in general, I recommend this movie.']
