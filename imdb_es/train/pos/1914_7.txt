Eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey, and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I've always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget has been done before, Kerry is quite unique and I can relate to her in many ways, although I'm not sure I like the direction her character took in the later series. <br /> <br /> The first episodes were fun, good and simple teen plots about Paul and Cate that discipline children, however, I think the show lost its luster when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and crew for wanting to continue the series, but when he died, I felt that the program did. For me, the main objective of the program was based on the guide of the '8 simple rules to go out with my teenage daughter', it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and angle of the program had changed without the father of Hennessey. <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed to get more upset, Rory stayed the same and Cate was always giving life lessons to her offspring who previously seemed more fun when everything was left to Paul. I think Grandpa is funny (especially when he's watching Great Escape) but he feels that C.J is unnecessary for the show. It's fun in parts, but I felt that the story lines at the time of their arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. About all the new ones, they are not bad just to lose the emotion and is it irritating to someone else that Cate works in school and that C.J and the grandfather are always there? I would always recommend this show to my friends, as it was very strong at first and it was well worth seeing for Paul and Kerry, but the last ones were, at best, average.
