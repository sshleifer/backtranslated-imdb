A young cat tries to steal the soul from the death of his brother, but only gets half and then has to venture to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm not sure what happens in this movie that is full of very strange and very surreal images, some of which parents may find disturbing (ie, cats that cut part of a pig that is to travel with them and fry it like the bacon that the three of them eat). <br /> <br /> This is a very strange movie that some have compared with Hello Kitty in acid, I think it's more like Hello Kitty like Dali did. . (Certainly, this is more alive than Destino, who relied directly on his work). <br /> <br /> If you are ready for a very extravagant movie that will challenge your perceptions of things, then watch this movie. Just get ready for some very strange images that will be recorded in your memory forever. <br /> <br />
