It was a bit strange and evil and I enjoyed it a lot, the characters of the show were also great and congratulated each other well. I was sorry to see you cut. I would have loved to see where I could have gone. You found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck, the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was terrifying and seductive. And I would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became. However, I will buy the program just to enjoy it, it was great for something different on TV. And Paige Turrco, who was Caleb's cousin, was a great mystery as to where and what it meant to Lucas. It is a pity that it is not yet ... or never finished, I would have loved to see what happened.
