Star Pickford and director Tourneur, along with their two favorite cameramen and their assistant Clarence Brown doing the editing, bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor and isolated Scottish islanders, the same territory that Michael Powell would bet twenty years later for his first great success. The visions of the wind and the waves, the silhouettes of the sun lovers not only complement the history, they are the history of the struggle against the difficulties. <br /> <br /> The actors carry the dignity of proud people to their roles and Pickford is brilliant as his character struggles with his duties as head of the clan, hesitating between comedy and consideration, here with his father's whip cornering the stray islanders to the church, sitting there with the staff of his guest in his hand like a scepter, talking about his lover, played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can choose the future star Leatrice Joy in the set. I tried, but I failed.
