Do you like to solve mysteries? Do you like complex narratives? This is for you. Bright and intelligent film by Francis Leclerc (son of a legendary Canadian French signer FÃ©lix Leclerc). The striking photo and the intelligent edition is the word of Leclerc, with the great help of Roy Dupuis, who is diestirambico in the leadership role. Being disconnected by someone unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him when he was ending the suffering of a deer on the road. Throughout the fight, he has a strange behavior and it seems that something seized him. <br /> <br /> It's not a scary movie, but very mysterious and well-interpreted. I have my hypothesis about the ending (I think the Indian caused the accident), but this ending was open to any explanation. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it 9.5 / 10
