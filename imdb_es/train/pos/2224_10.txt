An executioner (played by sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all men on death row before they meet their creator. And what a way to go. Luckily, this movie is not real, or we would have many more people in this world on death row. <br /> <br /> It starts very slow. Little light and bad acting, like most movies (B). It gets better as you go. And it ends with an explosion. <br /> <br /> I would rate it very high in the low cost, very attractive movies of the 90's. You have to see it once the children are away or in bed.
