This film has a rotten core of flexible morality and, however, a peculiar sense of justice. Many of the usual Joes among us would love to "stick it to MAN." The "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, whom Carla reports to you in his office. Later, Paul owes 70 grand to Mr. Marchand the owner of the club. And then there's Paul's Probation Officer. It seems that there is so much question about the parallel history of this last character. Reviewers point to it as a weakness in an underground ping-pong game well designed differently between our two protagonists, climbing tit-for-tat until their lives change dramatically. They are bound to each agent of the "MAN". One or both could be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not do what they are told. <br /> <br /> The movie has a sense of relief in the end. Carla finally goes to bed. His boss is expelled for being an imbecile. The owner of Mr. Club is a messy mess in his own bathroom. They get the $ money $. And ... you should not worry about informing the Probation Officer, because YOUR moral weakness leads you to hide your wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police have found to arrest him). It is a critical subconscious trigger for the blocker that envelops us so strongly. It does not matter that someone else can get Paul's file later to supervise his release; At the moment they are free! They could even get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> IT'S APPLIED TO MAN!
