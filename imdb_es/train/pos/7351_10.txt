This is one of my favorite movies of Govinda of all time and the best movie of 1994. David Dhawan does a great job directing this movie, it makes it fun and adds family drama. Govinda is excellent as Raja Babu and gives a great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress that I hate, this movie is a little less annoying but still annoying in some scenes. Kader Khan is a master in acting and yet he offers excellent performance. Aroona Irani is wonderful as the mother and offers exceptional performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as Nandu the companion. This movie has comedy, action, family drama and romance.
