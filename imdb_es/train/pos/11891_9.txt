'Loulou' delights in the same way that an expensive and high quality French wine does. It leaves you with a very fine aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Loulou's theme is not new. The film does not have an original plot either. His color image shows good, but not extraordinary. Its setting is serious. His elegant style never and nowhere puts any weight on his mind. <br /> <br /> What anyone else can say about 'Loulou', it is beyond any doubt that this very French film stands out for its excellent performance. The three drivers reflect convincingly all the many doubts and times that shine between them, giving life to the plot. Their performances invite you to participate, to make friends. <br /> <br /> For those who were at that time, 'Loulou' also offers an extra advantage: his mood perfectly captured in 1980.
