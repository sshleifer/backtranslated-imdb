['Eddie Murphy spends his time looking for lost children, so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in Tibet, sexy Charlotte Lewis asks for help to rescue this child from the clutches of evil. <br /><br /> Although the story is a bit silly, it never feels corny, despite the hilarity of the comedy throughout the film; Charles Dance compensates the comedy with its very serious and dark characterization of the evil that keeps the child hostage. <br /><br /> The Golden Child is very funny, it is full of action and it is really fascinating in a charming, almost magical way. <br /><br /> 7/10 Great for all generations.']
