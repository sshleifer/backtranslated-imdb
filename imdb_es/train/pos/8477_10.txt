in a not so conventional sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a child, and I recently remembered it, and I thought about looking for it. While many of the details are no longer clear in my mind, the general feeling that the film gave me stayed with me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent subjects. , then I recommend this movie. He taught me a lot about life and death, and it brought me many emotions. To this day, it's still one of my favorite movies.
