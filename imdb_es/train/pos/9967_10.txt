There are some things that I will never understand; Why does underwear come in packs of three when clearly that is not enough? In the same way, I will never understand this movie, and that's great. If you approach this movie waiting for a real movie, you could also approach Satan waiting for a hug; although that may be possible if you greet the satanic figures in this movie. Take Pitch for example; The most unhappy and unhappy portrait of a demon since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a Satan costume of ten feet of body paint and horns covered with condoms. However, it does create some of the funniest moments of any movie. Seriously, this is not an understatement. The same can be applied to all the other characters, except the little girl who behaves so innocently sickly that she is probably overcompensating for some serious crime of which she is a part. Then, again, if Santa's inter-spatial reconnaissance station is real, there is no possibility that she could have avoided it so long. In short, if you have not seen this movie, you can not consider yourself a serious amateur. The characterization, action, concept and racism almost fun that are in this case make this something to be seen over any movie to date (if what you are looking for is pure laughter).
