I discovered that this film was exciting from the beginning, as is a Spielberg film, and I discovered that the plot was intriguing when I tried to find out what the real situation was. <br /> <br /> From the beginning start - before the initial credits - the action starts, which brings immediate suspense. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very nice. (I do not like any of the Baldwins, because of Alec's extra-curricular political activities, but William was not so bad in this movie). <br /> <br /> There were several unexpected twists, which contributed to the enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were many places where there was a high-pitched and annoying sound on the soundtrack, something like 19K Hz. I suspect that the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set.
