This movie has some of the best comedy dialogues and memorable quotes in a single movie! The plot is somewhat deficient, but the delicious occurrences are enough to make up the difference. This is a timeless film for all ages that will surely please. As a form of cinematographic art it is very entertaining; and with big stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how can you make a mistake? <br /> <br /> Comic dialogue and time like this have been undervalued for a long time, and it is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the imitation of this 1986 film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film crawled and received bad reviews and comments from the viewers. Achieving a true comic dialogue is an art.
