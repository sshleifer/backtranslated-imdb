I saw this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie. I saw the movie as if it was not related to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and have seen what happens with most books when they become movies, so I developed a philosophy very soon. Suppose that the film will be based on the book (or the musical in this case) but that, although the story line may be similar, it will not be the same, it will be different, so look what it is. <Br /> <br /> I bailed for 12 years before I had to make a choice. He was a good dancer (I learned the choir in local productions when I was a child, etc.) but I did not have much talent. However, he was a great talent as a show driver. My dance instructor and my trainer (who spent several months a year at his farm out of state) told me that I had to make a decision when I turned 14. I had to go from dancing two hours, four and five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week .. and dedicate ourselves to one or the other. So I love dancing and I love this movie and many other ballet and dance films. I just chose to watch this movie for what it is, it's a great movie about pure emotion and human interaction. It's about the power of anticipation and anguish when you work very hard to get what you want and you just do not get it. I love the movie I love the Broadway musical.
