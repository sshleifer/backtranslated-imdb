I had seen this movie in the 80s and had almost forgotten it when I realized I was on TV again and I saw it. I remembered that I had liked this little sleeper when I first saw it, and I liked it even more on the second visit. <br /> <br /> All the actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest and Jason Presson (as the twelve-year-old child who feels responsible for the accidental death of his older brother), is excellent . The film has a very genuine feeling: a sober, quiet and deeply moving story of a family that suffers from pain. The dialogue is scarce but revealing, and the nonverbal performance is outstanding. Something like a simpler rural version of Ordinary People, without a psychiatrist, but with an equally impressive family dynamic. <br /> <br /> The stone boy is worth the time and the emotional energy that comes with seeing it.
