Congratulations to the director and the cast for such a realistic movie. The evil, the lack of glamor and the desperation took me to the film and they kept me there. I was really impressed by how the dates and information were transmitted within the film; that is, newspapers, letters, etc. I kept the film moving at such a rapid pace that I did not feel the need to move forward once. Personally, I thought that all the principles did a tremendous job ... it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me want to cry sometimes. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... his performances of this nature usually leave me amazed. In general, this is a brilliant movie that should not be missed!
