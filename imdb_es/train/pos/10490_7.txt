Another example of what British cinema can achieve: a simple story, told and acted well. Brenda Blethyn offers a layered and warm performance as Grace recently widowed and in financial difficulty, ably assisted by a solid cast. The "quirky little town" card is played to its fullest, similar to many television series and movies that have come from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). Like the aforementioned, this film uses a dazzlingly beautiful rural landscape, in this case, the wet and wild coast of Cornwall. <br /> <br /> Some viewers may find that the widespread acceptance of cannabis use is a bit challenging, others may find it ending up just a little too cute and safe. But it's a pleasant pleasure, of course.
