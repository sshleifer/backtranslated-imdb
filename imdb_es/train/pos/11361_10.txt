Although I saw this movie years ago, its impact has never left me. Stephen Rea's description of an investigator is profound and moving. His anguish over not being able to stop the deaths is palpable. Everyone in the cast is incredible, from Sutherland, who tries to accommodate him and provides ways for the police to coordinate their efforts, to the citizen with problems x. Every day, when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers, I think about this movie and the exhausting work that people who try to find murderers do.
