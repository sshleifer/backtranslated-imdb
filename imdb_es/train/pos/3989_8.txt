"The mother" speaks of a mother of two grown children (Reid), widowed and newly widowed, in the mid-60s, who, on the heels of her husband's death, is waking up from a sleepwalking life, since He has an affair with a young carpenter who also married his daughter's lover. The film focuses on the silent and passive mother, her tenuous relationship with her older son and daughter, the silent needs she tries to pacify in bed with her young lover and the convolutions that arise there. A somewhat antiseptic drama with reverberant psychodramatic currents, "La Madre" does an excellent job to realistically treat uncomfortable topics while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism. It will play better with more mature audiences, possibly women, who can empathize better with the central character, their needs and problems. (B +)
