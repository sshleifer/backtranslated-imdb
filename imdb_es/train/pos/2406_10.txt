This is the best example of how I think Jesus really was. Most of the films show Jesus as effeminate, lobotomized or tortured. Jesus laughed, played and was serious when necessary. This is the kind of people that Jesus' people might be attracted to, not the usual Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The film took some liberties, trying to "fill in the blanks". But the fillings did not seem impossible, not even improbable. One thing I could argue is that he never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (the film described that the Romans were the main promoter of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities were against the idea). <br /> <br /> It seemed that the movie was well researched. an example was the direct comment to a teenager called "brand". it is believed that mark (or john mark) was the child referred to in the garden of Gethsemane, whose cloak was removed and escaped naked (Mark 14:51). I have the feeling that they tried to make the film as accurate as possible (even in spirit).
