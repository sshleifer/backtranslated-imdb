Welcome to Collinwood is many things, but it is not any of the following: <br /> <br /> A star vehicle of George Clooney Unfunny Un-Original <br /> <br /> And yes, I know, the basis for The movie is another movie. But when it comes to Hollywood, this may be one of the most authentic results of this decade, and for me it is. <br /> <br /> The film is from beginning to end, a real gas. Here is why. <br /> <br /> There is not a bad performance in the movie. The fun parts are fun. The nerve parts are nervous. The script contains, not a boring moment of dialogue. The cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful. And it does not conform to the Hollywood norm (you'll see what I mean when you see the movie). <br /> <br /> As a child, I remember seeing advertisements for the movie. This movie was under the radar after not raising much at the box office, and is not even a cult classic. The reason why Transformers 2 is considered acceptable by average movie viewers is because they are used to seeing Transformers 2. If the movie is as original and fun as it is, it is extracted as often as millions of pieces of s ** t, the cinematic experience would be a much cooler place - <br /> <br /> When 'they' say they do not do them like they used to, 'they' did not see Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> <br /> A fun, mini-masterpiece of the caper comedy, which refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
