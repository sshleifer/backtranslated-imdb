['&quot;Tarzan and his partner&quot;, the second of MGM&#39;s photographs in Tarzan, picks up one year after the events of &quot;Tarzan the monkey man&quot;. Tarzan and Jane have been living happily in the jungle, and Harry Holt (one of the expeditionaries in the first film) returns, this time accompanied by the less honorable Martin Arlington, in search of the ivory of the cemetery of the elephants. Naturally, a variety of dangerous and exciting adventures take place along the way. <br /><br /> The first film romanticized everything: the jungle, adventure, romance, wild animals and even death. The second film still has a lot of romanticism and many wonderful action sequences, but a more serious tone underlies the action. The characters dare to ask questions like: What happens if something happened to Tarzan? What would Jane do if she were left alone in the middle of the jungle and had to fend for herself? While these are probably the questions that real people would ask themselves in this situation, it creates a certain sadness that is not always as fun as the attitude of throwing caution to the wind of the original. <br /><br /> One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is the growth we see in Tarzan and Jane&#39;s relationship. Tarzan still speaks very broken English, but clearly he has learned some new words from his partner. Also, their mutual love has really blossomed, and we feel that they really have spent a year together in the jungle. <br /><br /> Most people consider that &quot;Tarzan and his partner&quot; are superior to the original &quot;Tarzan monkey man&quot;. Personally, the first movie I liked a little better. The main reason is that the relationship between the team of Harry Holt and Martin Arlington is not as pleasant as Holt&#39;s relationship with James Parker (Jane&#39;s father) of the original. The character of Mr. Arlington could have worked as a great villain in the movie, but he plays the hero for much of the movie. The movie can never decide if we should love it or hate it. (Also, I do not want to reveal anything, but in one of the scenes where we should hate him, Jane never finds out about those events, so the ending is not as satisfying as it could have been). However, all of these detractors are relatively minor, and it&#39;s still a great movie. <br /><br /> Like the first film, &quot;Tarzan and His Mate&quot; has incredible action scenes, wonderful images of wildlife and one of the best romances of all time on the screen. If you liked the first movie of the series, this is definitely a continuation to watch.']
