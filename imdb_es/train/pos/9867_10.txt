The first time I saw Ice Age in Subiaco cinemas was when it came out, in 2002. I was only 13 years old at the time, but even then I liked it. He had some kind of warmth. <br /> <br /> We've had it on video for several years and no matter how many times you see it, it never gets boring. This is due to an element that makes it different from all the other 3D animations made at that moment: the characters do not have a particular "home" from which they leave. They are nomads, and that is really refreshing and stimulating to see. <br /> <br /> In addition, each individual character on the surface, it seems that they are just holding each other, but in reality they are all good friends. In addition, all the characters have their own charms (even the bad ones). Sid the lazy one is charming in his annoying form, too affectionate and naive. Manny is adorable in his depressed and lonely character, and so on. <br /> <br /> Another important point about the film is the beauty of animation. All environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic advantage. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feeling of the film, is that the genre means very little. There are almost no female characters, but you do not really realize that until you see it several times and even then it has little effect on the way you see the movie. Because of this, there is also no mention of a nuclear family that would really be pathetic in an environment such as the Ice Age. <br /> <br /> In short, the Ice Age is a great movie and is a test of how much effort. It was put into 3D animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
