A very good adaptation of the novel amrita pritam. Urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best effort. <br /> <br /> There is a natural touch in the movie and I felt good. It seemed that Bollywood finally bestowed its glamor and had quality performers acting on the screen. <br /> <br /> As for the content, the film showed a lot exactly what happened during the partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that confidence in one's life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best thing of everything is that they did not turn it into a drama with great amount of tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
