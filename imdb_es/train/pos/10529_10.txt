By no means my favorite Austen novel, and Paltrow is by no means my favorite actress, but I found the film almost totally charming. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays 'Miss Bates' are absolutely great. The detail of the period is not alienating; The feeling of the movie is the right one, in fact. But the real 'find' is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. There could not be a more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr. K in the novel, but I found him wonderfully human and human in the movie. The good looks of Northam and his smiling eyes are not an obstacle to enjoy. Highly recommended AnaR
