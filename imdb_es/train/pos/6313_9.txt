['Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is told in prison about a perfect robbery. Since he is behind bars and can not do it himself, he has to leave it to his little girl Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). So far there are five guys organizing the crime: five men with very little brain capacity. Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood (2002). It is a criminal comedy that is often very funny. You can not help laughing when everything goes wrong with these guys. There are some great actors playing these characters. William H.Macy plays Riley. Isaiah Washington is Leon. Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto. Andy Davoli is Basil. Gabrielle Union plays her love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito interprets the love interest of Pero Carmela.George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, the tattooed guy in a wheelchair. It is a very entertaining movie. I definitely recommend it.']
