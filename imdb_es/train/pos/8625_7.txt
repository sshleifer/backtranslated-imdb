Jörg Buttgereit goes a little too far with his films and themes sometimes, even for my liking, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are done artistically, with often also a deeper meaning to their subjects. This movie is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> It is also very difficult to label this movie. It is not really a movie with a story, in the sense of having a beginning, middle and end in it. Neither has a main character, but focuses on 7 different suicides and murders, in 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All the different stories are told with a lot of class, although some of them are, of course, More 'interesting' and realistic than the others. They are not necessarily connected but, nevertheless, together they still tell a story. The film does not feel disconnected at all. All the different stories have a different feel and Buttgereit tells the story without using almost any word (it is also typical of his style), but allows the obvious images and emotions of the characters to tell the whole story. Help make this movie effective to watch. <br /> <br /> Again, the production values ​​are not too high and this could be something that can scare some people. However, it helps that this particular movie sets the right tone and atmosphere for the entire film and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. <br /> <br /> A Buttgereit movie that I "enjoyed" watching. <br /> <br /> 7/10
