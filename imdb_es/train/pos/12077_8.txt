I greatly enjoyed this 1945 suspense and mystery movie about a young girl, Nina Foch, (Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local newspaper in London looking for a secretary and rushes to try to get this position. Julia gets the job and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires her to live with her employer at home and wants her not to get involved with friends, Julia and she tells them that she has no family and that is free. to devote all his time to this work. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange wishes to play with knives. This was a low budget movie and most of the scenes were close to avoid the expense of a fund and the costs of the scenario. This strange family lives in a huge mansion on the Cornish coast of England and there are secret doors and a lot of suspense.
