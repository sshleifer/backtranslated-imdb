They are the highlights of this feature of 1917. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young woman who becomes a clan leader after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple life of the "fishing people". My copy is very dark and, sometimes, difficult to read, but the film has an impressive seascape, and the work of the camera on the boats is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this pleasant film. Pickford was already an important star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: a brave young woman triumphs over misfortune. Pickford's whip lashing the lazy villagers to the church is a lot of fun. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. It's not a great Picford movie, but it's worth watching. Matt Moore (Pickford married his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and is as good as the young man on the island. Leatrice Joy is one of the villages, but I could not see her either. My copy intersperses a lot of bells and gongs, and adds a strange feeling when the village warning bells ring. Highly effective.
