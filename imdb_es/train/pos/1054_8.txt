If you want nonsense action, hot girls and a post-apocalyptic vision of Seattle, this is the program for you! <br /> <br /> The concept of Dark Angel is nothing new (in fact, there is controversy about whether James Cameron stole the idea of ​​a book), but I spend all the time looking at it every Tuesday from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba is smoking and Max's friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are a shot. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are improving, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max need to be a little better (the jargon sounds forced and it seems that someone who lives in the suburbs wrote it). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure full of all that an action fan could ask for, but if you are looking for a compelling and award-winning drama, go see "The West Wing" or something.
