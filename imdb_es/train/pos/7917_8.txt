After reading the other reviews and lukewarm comments, I felt that I had to come to bat for this movie. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films tend to have little to do with each other, and I hope this is one of the others. What he liked is probably out of place. <br /> <br /> What this film is is a thoughtful and blatant look at religious faith. The only other film like this, in terms of its religious message, would have to be "The Rapture" by Tolkin. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that someone can say that the story is confusing or supernatural. It is a simple film about the Catholic faith, miracles and redemption, although you would never guess until the end. It is also the only movie I can think of whose resolution is literally based on a play on words. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic (happily) fallen, I know what the film is about and I find a kind of affection in his ultimate innocence about the relationship between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based, it will go through your head. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, instead of a story, "Cold Heaven" is not innovative. While 'The Rapture' is loaded with pictorial meaning and cinematic images, 'Cold Heaven' downplays its own cinematic qualities. There are no striking shots, no avant-garde effects, no attempts to adjust the content to the form. It's a work shot, but moderate. Nor does he have dialogue or acting to put him in a high drama class. It is a simple story that unfolds simply. It may seem strange; But in the end the mystery is revealed. It seems ambiguous; but with a single line, the ambiguity vanishes in a mouthful of Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In this sense, 'Cold Heaven' has in its heart exactly the same kind of thing that drives a movie like 'The Sting,' or 'The Sixth Sense' 'or' Final Descent ', or 'A pure formality' by Polanski. All these are movies with a trick up their sleeve. It is possible that they will frustrate you on the way, but they have a point, of course, but the fun is, at least in part, having been admitted. <br /> <br /> Even so, even if it seems little more than a story of furry dogs with a punch line, it's worth looking at the way it directs you and misguides you. Try it, especially if you are or have ever been Catholic.
