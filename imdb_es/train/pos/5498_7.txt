['This documentary was broadcast in both RTE and BBC in recent months. After having seen it twice, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the creation of documentary and multimedia films. <br /><br /> Initially, this documentary was intended to detail the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. The Irish crew departed with those intentions. What happens when they arrive in Venezuela is surprising, as they are direct witnesses of the attempted overthrow by the rebel factions (especially the oil concerns in Venezuela) of Chavez and his government. What the audience witnesses is how the media manipulates the situation and, in effect, supports the overthrow of Chávez by distorting the events that happen as the blow increases. <br /><br /> It really is an excellent documentary and a remarkable work by a couple of novice filmmakers. <br /><br />']
