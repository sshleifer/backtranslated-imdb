This dark of Sica delivers the goods. And it is said "the meek will inherit the earth." This story of classes on the surface, but actually an allegory for all the homeless people who populated Europe after the great war. They have no home but they are happy, in a society too impoverished and selfish to care for or recognize them, they are the carpets of the Italians. De Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I can not say if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words, "Once upon a time ...", to exemplify the timelessness of its history, since history could be established anywhere and at any place. The sketches of the caricature of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, the capricious nature of homeless people, especially when they begin to grant their wishes, and the end of an image of Spielberg makes this boulange a delight for all. The most accessible image of De Sica is also one of its best. Abandoning neo-realism, he always intertwined between that and the good old movie, creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the longing for hope that one has to keep going to this world. Thanks Vittorio! Thanks thanks !!! Thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!
