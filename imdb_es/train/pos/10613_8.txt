This is a lost horror gem long ago starring Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it's hard to locate a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This movie is scary but cheesy at the same time. It seems that 3 newly arrived women (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) travel to the small town of Solvang, California, to cover a festival when there is confusion involving their hotel room and seek refuge in the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feeling sick, since the other 2 are going to film her story. She is murdered soon in the house, in a VERY cheesy way by some unknown force that hides in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the closed cover of the ventilation opening when it crashes into her while dragging her through the basement) . Soon Karen returns and is killed in an even more brutal way by having her face traversed by the ventilation cover. Jennifer is fighting with her (ex?) Lover in a pretty boring sub-plot and when she returns home, her hosts (whom we have already discovered are brothers and that everything in the basement is her son) conceive a plot to try Murder her too. Virgina does not totally agree with Earnest's plan to kill Jennifer, but they trick her into going to the basement where she meets Junior. Here, the film becomes almost comical since Junior (hysterically portrayed by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient man whose actions and movements will cause some laughter despite the fact that they are supposed to be scary. This is where the pace of the movie accelerates and the ending is well done. The actors / actresses do an excellent job with the material, especially Lassick, Furst and Bach, and although it's not the most horrible movie ever made, it's very entertaining.
