Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves to his home in Manchester to be close to his father. On the way, he falls in love with Anna, a woman 20 years older than him, and who happens to be the wife of his new boss, Richard Crane. Despite warnings from his new colleagues, Owen proceeds to find Anna for himself, going as far as to sabotage Anna and Richard's cheating marriage. This is a romantic drama with many humorous nuances and a quick wit. The actors are superb: the green of "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" are mixed on the screen as the cunning and warm Owen; The fame of Annis from "Dune" is animated and proves to be a good combination for Green; The kitchen, from "To Play The King," is the right threat, like Richard, whose comic errors and snobbishness underscore his mastery and hatred of Owen. This is a perfect love triangle and, despite the weaknesses and fallacies of our three characters, you come better to know and observe them.
