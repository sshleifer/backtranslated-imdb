A good movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a particular mention to the "Portobello Ballet" are beautiful. As for the animated section, the game between animals has become an instant classic; The climax with the attack of the armors is chilling and fascinating. I recommend seeing the restored version of 134 minutes or at least the 112 minute video. Here in Italy we only have the 98 minute version, although the film was presented in its original release with a duration of 117 minutes. If possible, see also the German videocassette: it was generated from the 98 consecutive minutes, but it is missing in every reference to the Second World War and in all the scenes between the English and their Nazi invaders!
