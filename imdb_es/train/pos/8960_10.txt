This may not be War and Peace, but the two Noms of the Academy would not have arrived if it were not for the genius of James Wong Howe ... <br /> <br /> this is one of the few movies I fell in love with as a child and I returned without dissatisfaction. Whether you are interested in what you offer in a fictitious manner or not, BB & C is a visual feast. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's your best job, I'm not an expert there for sure. But the aspect of this movie is incredible. I love everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, the cat, the crazy hoo-doo, the retro-downtown-ness; but the way it was recorded in the movie is impressive. <br /> <br /> I even like the inconsistencies noted on this previous page and the "special effects" that now seem backward. everything creates a really consistent world.
