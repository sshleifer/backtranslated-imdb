No message No symbolism There are no dark currents. Only a wonderful mix of music, nostalgia and good fun gathered by people who obviously had a great time doing it. It is a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious waste that is being eliminated by the studios. Of course, it's worth seeing ANYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz singing is an advantage. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. This goes on the shelf of my film to be taken out again whenever I feel the need for a warm experience and a kind and friendly laugh. Only a wonderful movie!
