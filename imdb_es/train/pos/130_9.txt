['In October 1945, the German American descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in a post-war Frankfurt and his uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets a job for him on the Zentropa train line as a sleeper driver. . While traveling on the train learning his profession, go to the destroyed occupied Germany and meet Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the former transport business entrepreneur and owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between the allied forces and the Germans, and realizes that there is a terrorist group called &quot;Werewolves&quot; that kills the supporters of the allies and performs subversive actions against the allied forces. He falls in love with Katharina, and before she reveals that she was a &quot;werewolf&quot;. When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also pressured by the &quot;werewolves&quot; and needs to take a stand and a decision. <br /><br /> &quot;Europa&quot; is an impressive and anguished story of Kafkanian by the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style reminiscent of Fritz Lang and alternating a magnificent black and white cinematography with some colorful details, this film reveals a difficult period in Germany and some of the problems that this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war. The action of the occupying forces is very impressive, destroying resources that could allow a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country, and corruption with the Jew that should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an impressive performance in the role of the man who wants to remain neutral but who is manipulated by everyone. Max Von Sydow&#39;s hypnotic narrative is another touch of class in this award-winning film. My vote is nine. <br /><br /> Title (Brazil): &quot;Europe&quot;']
