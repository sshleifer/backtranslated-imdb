In the 1980s, long before the NAFTA was drafted and corporations began to dispose of their national identities, the United States and Japan faced each other in the global manufacturing race. Remember such things as 'Yes, yes!' ', The Japanese are taking over this country' and 'Americans are lazy?' <br /> <br /> As the Reagan era faded away and corporations headed towards a global marketplace, director Ron Howard made one of several trips to the comedy genre with his great 1986 hit 'Gung. Ho ', which raised more than $ 36 million in US box office receipts. UU Although in many aspects it is dated, the ironic story of the clashing cultures in Howard's workplace still offers a hard truth for today's industrial life. <br /> <br /> 'Gung Ho' focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the car dealership representative of Hadleyville, a small, depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania. Stevenson has been asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to the real life of Toyota), which is considering a US operation in the empty plant of the city. With hundreds of jobless residents and the city on the verge of collapse, Assan decides to move and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line. <br /> <br /> The 112 minutes of 'Gung Ho' is a humorous look at these two sides, with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered: on the one hand, an American workforce that values ​​their traditions but is often trapped in the frenzy of pride and unionism; On the other hand, Japanese workers are extremely dedicated to their work but lack personal satisfaction and feelings of self-esteem. In Stevenson, we find a figure of the American working class of average intelligence with the skills to converse with people through misunderstandings. With the survival of the jobs of his workers and most of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson proves he is a nice guy who wants only a fair chance, although his intelligence will sink him into many problems. In addition to responding to Assan's bosses, we are witnessing a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and his fellow union members, many of whom grew up. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro) and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). <br /> <br /> The Japanese cast is headed by Gedde Watanabe, also known as 'Sixteen Candles' and Volunteers. Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the plant manager who has bad luck and begins to feel sympathy for American life. He is constantly in the shadow of Saito (Sab Shimono), the nephew of Assan's CEO who is desperate to take his place in the hierarchical order. While they are given a light touch, these characters do very well to convey ideas of the Japanese work culture. <br /> <br /> With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script, Michael Keaton has to offer a solid interpretation for this film to work. 'Gung Ho' is indeed a great success for Keaton, who also joined Ron Howard in 'The Paper' of 1994. He made this film during a series of lighter roles that included 'Mr. Mom, '' Beetle Juice '' and 'The Dream Team' before venturing into 'Batman', 'One Good Cop' and 'My Life'. It's also hard not to like the performance of Gedde Watanabe as the strange man who first uses Japanese tapes of shame before partnering with Stevenson to make the automatic plant a cohesive unit. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is top Notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono and Soh Yamamura as CEO of Assan, Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers provides a romantic interest as Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel came together for the solid writing of Gung Ho. The incidental music, which received a BMI Film Music Award, was composed by Thomas Newman. The songs on the Gung Ho soundtrack are wall-to-wall 80s, which include 'Do not Get Me Wrong', 'Tuff Enuff' and 'Working Class Man'. <br /> <br /> The success of 'Gung Ho' actually led to a short-lived television series on ABC. Although more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago, Ron Howard's film still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount widescreen collection and is slightly modified. Audio options are available in English 5.1 surround, English Dolby surround and French "dubbing", but subtitles are in English only. There are no extras, not even the theatrical trailer. On the positive side, the Paramount digital transfer is pretty good, with little grain after the initial credits and high quality sound. While some extras would have been useful, especially since 'Gung Ho' was a blockbuster, there is nothing to complain about the presentation of the film itself. <br /> <br /> *** of 4
