Another fantastic film from a country, where due to decades of oppression by fundamentalist regimes, has no problem creating a passionate theme. Panahi takes a different approach this time with a mix of ironic comedy and an endearing and unprofessional cast. While continuing to convey his message of what he sees as inherently evil in his country, he does so without the need for a heavy story. It is a positive opinion about a country, particularly its people, that the Iranian population desperately needs. The biggest pain is that it will not be released nationally. The insular and paranoid Iranian government says that this good filmmaker is only successful abroad because it is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing up in the middle of the revolution and seeing academics, artists and educators "disappearing" in the last 25 years, he shows great courage to continue exposing his work. The realism achieved by shooting the classifier of the real world cup really transports you to the event. The fact that he shot it in 35 mm is incredible, since most would only try this project in digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence on using only non-professional actors also works in this film. Good performances throughout the year. After watching many films that show the problems that Iran has and also the media that inform the facts, we can tend to demonize people as well as the government. This movie does the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law, perhaps a change for the better is not too far away. Some call Panahi a feminist filmmaker, but I think she only fights for the most oppressed demographics of Iran. Young and independent women
