This first Anime movie was a pretty good movie that I was able to see once on the Science Fiction channel when Anime was really popular here in the United States and not the classification disaster that adult swimming claims to be in the cartoon network . Frankly, I think it has less to do with being less popular and more with the fact that people would now prefer to buy DVDs and watch the episodes uncut on the Internet. Although this movie probably did not have so many cuts and the voice work was fine for a dubbed movie, although I would prefer to see the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything bent. This film introduces a young man who takes a train called Galaxy Express with the hope of reaching a planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot that hunts humans for fun. During the course of his adventures, he befriends the various workers aboard the train, as well as a woman who resembles her deceased mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who, like most women in the movies of Anime, have a secret that could be really good. For our young hero, or really bad. It also goes from planet to planet when the train makes several stops and encounters a space pirate named Captain Harlock who apparently starred in his own cartoon series, so basically the Galaxy Express takes place in that universe. In short, a very good trip with a quite strange and unexpected end. There would be a sequel to this, but it was not as good as this, however, the ending was a bit more definitive than here.
