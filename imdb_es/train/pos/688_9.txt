I had the pleasure of watching this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and I was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this movie, I am very anxious to see what she can do with an important photo. Congratulations to the cast for their excellent performances (that girl was gold) and who wrote the music. The deformed "Row your boat" dragged me. A very creative film everywhere ... I really hope to see it come out on video or DVD because I would buy it in a second. If you have the opportunity, you should definitely watch this movie.
