This film makes a strong comment about the Italians of the time. The use of mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is charming and I can not fail to mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love you both. Your way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you may wonder if the camera is really there. The husband, in his brief role, also presents himself in an excellent way as the Italian fascist who sends his wife and children but, in his way, a loving father. The initial scenes with Hitler in the Piazza Venezia with all the Italians are incredible and they really locate the film historically. I loved the movie and I also agree that it's fun that I'm not more famous.
