I must say that I had wanted to see this movie for a long time, and it did not disappoint me. Dominic Monaghan's performance is simply fantastic. As an insomniac part of myself, I can relate to how the story unfolds. I have never experienced anything like that, but some waking moments overlap when sleeping and can be scary. It was a great movie, worth every penny. I hope that one day I can work with Tess, it would be an honor and beyond. I can recommend it for everyone. Maybe they are not small children because they can be scared. But if you are an insomniac like me, you will understand the world, the mysteries and fear. You'll love it. <br /> <br /> F.
