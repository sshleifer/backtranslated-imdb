You can debate Prince's acting talent, or even his decision to parody his own life in this movie. There is no debate about his musical talent neither then nor now. It seems that it has been a dark place twenty years later, but music is still relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> Having lived through the exaggeration of this movie (I graduated from high school in 1985), I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at that time. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor "Little Nikki" and everything else under the sun through the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to every "Air Band" at the time he was posing as Prince, It was the hottest thing. For at least a few weeks, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the movie and we were very excited when it was released. I was not disappointed. All were caught. I was an MTV addict at that time (they really played music then ... all the time) Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I should rate this comment by saying that, at that time, my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in the Punk / New Wave genre. Prince's music at the time transcended all types and styles. One of the reasons why part of this seems so corny and regretful now is that it was so big then. All the things that remind you of the 80s were iconic then. It was common and seems like a clich√© now. It became so popular that it became ridiculous. It's like Rappin's commercial 'Granny for Wendy's Hamburgers. <br /> <br /> It seems stupid now because EVERYONE was stuck in this (sadly, something like a strange purple macarena or something like that.) Anyway, I hope this has given everyone a little idea.
