I do not know what I like about this movie, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or war dramas, but I really wondered how and when Winfield would find his son. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. To tell you the truth, I have not seen this movie in years or been seen on TV for a while, but this movie is something like a man's odyssey after the pains of war. Winfield shows a very nice and comforting portrait of a man lost for his memories. There is an underlying message in this film that he is looking for the last part of human morality after this war and the reality he faces. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
