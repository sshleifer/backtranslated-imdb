The direction behind this movie was fantastic for a comedy. Many of the scenes seem to be out of a comic and much darker (visually, not in terms of the story) than I expected. Of course, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you like sexist jokes, since this has very little of that (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie). While you watch it again, several jokes stand out and become more fun. If you have ever read a comic book or seen a comic book movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and have liked it, you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the film. If you did not like them, you may like the respectful ridicule that this movie has for them. If you liked this movie, the DVD has some great extras. (8/10)
