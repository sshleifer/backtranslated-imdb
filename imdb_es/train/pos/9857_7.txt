Although I loved this movie, the advances that circulated on the Internet the year before it hit theaters exceeded my expectations. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD, so do not get me wrong, I'm not saying Do not look at it or buy it! It's just that I still think that the first scene was the best one, and nothing in the whole movie got over it.
