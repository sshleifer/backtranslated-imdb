This is not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise' but it's a good road movie. Set your two main characters with softness and ease. viewers quickly learn the underlying tensions, which is a tribute to the director. there is the young man who speaks French (and English) who wants to do well in France, has a French girlfriend and drinks alcohol, parties like young men. And there is his Arabic-speaking father (and Frenchman) who follows his Muslim faith with devotion, with generosity and wisdom of the elderly and who rejects the new culture that surrounds him (such as mobile phones). The film could explore a very powerful policy: the strange couple was driving through the former Yugoslavia, through Turkey and then through the Middle East to reach Mecca. these are areas where Muslim populations have been involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators have persecuted torture and summary executions to maintain power and where religious communities are in constant mortal battle with each other. however, the film moves through those places and possibilities only with hints of such agendas. The relationship between the two is key to this film, and faith, politics are the backdrop. It seems to be saying that we are all human, and we need to understand each other and take care of each other in order to be able to handle ourselves well in this world. It's certainly not 'Natural Born Killers' and it's better because of that.
