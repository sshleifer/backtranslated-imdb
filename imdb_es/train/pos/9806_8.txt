I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I saw this program only by accident in 1994 and I fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and I loved all the other roles he has been in. I can not believe that the program has only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as the extravagant charming friend of Hudson in the series. When they broadcast this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or in hours off. The show lasts less than an hour. I felt that this program should have lasted longer, but the casting changes in the second season really made the program a little less interesting. I did not care about Sylvia, but I missed actress Julia Phillips-Lane the previous season. I felt that this show took a risk and often worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant nor did they try to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast instead of making them all British. I liked seeing Julia Ormond in a first role. I felt that this show should have lasted longer. Sometimes I felt that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a success in the United States.
