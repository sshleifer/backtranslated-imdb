The memory of "The Last Hunt" has stayed with me since I saw him in 1956, when he was 13 years old. It is a film that was far ahead of others at the time it addressed the treatment of natives, the environment, and the ever-present contrast between the short and long-term effects of greed. It is as relevant today as in 1956, a film discussion of the greatest depth and relevance. To top it off, the scenery is beautiful and the cinematography is excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me until the end of my days.
