Ted Mapes, sitting on the front porch of his Burbank home, told me that he and Reed Hadley were exactly the same size on all the garments except the hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the biggest doubles. He said that every time Zorro put on his mask, he was the one on the screen. <br /> <br /> That was a little exaggerated: there were times when Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but in the tricks. We can be sure that Ted was at work. <br /> <br /> And what tricks! "The Legion of Fox Fight" is, as witness the comments here, one of the largest series. It is exciting and in general it is very well done. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a good actor and, as someone else commented, he did a very good fop. <br /> <br /> But, certainly, it's the action that makes this movie so cool. <br /> <br /> And what else can we expect, with the direction of that excellent team, Witney and English, with excellent music from the incredibly prolific William Lava (the list here says it was not accredited, but that's wrong, the other composers listed here certainly were not, and I do not know if they wrote anything of the music (sounds like Lava) and with the villainy of, among others, the great Charles King, and with dozens of small parts? <br /> <br /> He also highlighted a villain played by Tarzan radio, Jim Pierce, who was the son-in-law of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I urge you to read his mini-biography). <br /> <br /> There is a chapter that slows down things depressingly, but, hell, it only lasts a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you browse it, well, you went back to the excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner's classic films deserve a big THANK YOU for presenting this excellent series, and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we should I want to thank everyone involved that we can see it as a set of chapters or a series, and not as a clipping feature.
