Ah, a Kelly / Sinatra musical in a sailor suit. So familiar, right? Yes, but this is not the one you usually listen to. In the city is that road. But if you stay, you can learn something. It's okay, probably not. Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors with a three or four day license. Joe is the "sea lion" and Clarence, the kind of book, asks Joe to get him a "lady". Now, after they are picked up by the cops, they take little Donald home. That's where they meet Susie, that temptress, that jezebel. It's a joke! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he does it. Is right? Or is he an imbecile? Or is he simply wrong about society? Discover all this and more when you see {trumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want Kathryn Grayson to be anything but sick, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
