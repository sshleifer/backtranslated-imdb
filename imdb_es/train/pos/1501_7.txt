An excellent movie and a great example of how terrifying a movie can be without showing the viewer anything. It is a set of four stories that revolve around the tenants of a charming old house and its varied and frightening destinations, all united by a complete story about a Scotland Yard inspector looking for a missing horror movie star. It begins with a story about a mysterious writer whose main character becomes too realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed with a wax figure in a museum, and then a story about a sweet little angelic child who is Anything less, and ending with the story of what happened to the missing movie star and what he does to the inspector. It is a beautiful impression that allows you to really appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he could achieve with a very small budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee, and you have a movie that you can enjoy over and over again. Just do not answer the phone if someone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain in a beautiful house in the English countryside.
