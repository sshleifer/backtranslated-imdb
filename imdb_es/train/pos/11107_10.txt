The Sopranos (who now prepare to finish) are the pinnacle of television and adult drama. When The Sopranos hits the mark, it really hits the mark. Using great writing and great actors (most of them are Goodfellas extras), the series is out loud to progress in a satisfying, unpredictable and exceptional way. Topping the cast is James Gandolfini, who for all intents and purposes is Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco, who certainly has his own. The series also has a large collection of regular customers to drive the plot by any means necessary (usually violence and rude language). Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are excellent supporting characters that make each episode more interesting. Seasonal extras are also worth mentioning, including names like Steve Buscemi (great!), Joe Pantoliano (excellent!), David Proval (good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. <br /> <br /> The Sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of today's mafia societies that, despite the rare bad stories, manage to be a unique television. Symbolism and simple story lines, dreams and shootings and many other things create interwoven stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create another perfect HBO package. Look at it...
