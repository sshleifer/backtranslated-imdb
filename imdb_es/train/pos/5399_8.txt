['The last great Gosha movie of the sixties. A resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose for his films, Gosha joined Shintaro Katsu (of Zatoichi fame) to produce this accusation of meaningless nationalist loyalty. <br /><br /> &quot;Tenchu&quot; (celestial judgment) is the word that the emperor loyalists shout while killing enemies or &quot;traitors&quot; to the cause. Katsu demonstrates the mental loyalty of his character to a manipulative politician, all in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who questions the politician is labeled a &quot;traitor&quot; and becomes a target for murder. <br /><br /> One of the best films photographed, many shots are incredible compositions of form, color and light. The scenes of fight are frequent and very bloody and brutal. The blood becomes part of the color palette that Gosha uses for his images. Beautiful and disturbing. While the personal story is easy to follow, the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this moment in Japan would be very useful, you can go through the movie without it. The few drawbacks of the film are the music track, the duration and the occasional mastication of the Katsu stage. It has a drunken scene that is way above a movie, but it&#39;s actually a very accurate representation of a drunk. <br /><br /> Downbeat but one of the great films of chambara.']
