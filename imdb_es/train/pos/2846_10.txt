I'm not a writer or critic ... I'm just a student that I've seen this movie a few minutes ago ... And I want to thank the people who worked on the creation of this film! It is not the best nor the most ... but it touched my heart ... why? I would like to understand it myself ... it's easy and accessible ... it's a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without repentance. about the time lost in seeing it. It's about love and care, about the life we ​​have, but sometimes we miss him for material things ... Look at all the time we have but we miss him. ... why do j * k do that? We need to live as if we were dying ... we take care of every second and remember: if we do good things, good things come back to us! Apathy is real ... and has a special flavor in New York ... I love this city and the world we live in !!!! thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
