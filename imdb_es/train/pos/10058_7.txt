I admit that I am a little tired about the cinematographic genre of a small child that softens the heart of his reticent tutor. Have I seen enough of them? Baby Boom, Kolya, About a child, mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider? Expect to be bored by the formula. What struck me in The King of Masks was the seriousness of the scenario: the small city of China in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and little girls were considered so useless to poor parents who killed them at birth or gave them to those who took them to the black market. When Wang discovers that her purchased grandson, who was nicknamed "Puppy", is a granddaughter, he initially throws her out, even though she has shown great promise as a street heiress. Even after he reluctantly removes her, he is not so upset when they kidnap her. The film is of great quality then, showing the distances that a young, intelligent street had to go to survive in that society. <br /> <br /> The two main performances are credible and seductive in their social context. In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of Wang's resentment for not having achieved more material success. However, Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low social status that I do too. While Doggie exhibits a level of precocity and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it is completely credible in the context of a child's survival mode in a society that treats poor girls as if they were garbage. And after learning that her previous seven owners have mistreated her physically and mentally, her fierce bond with Wang makes a lot of sense. <br /> <br /> The look at the life of a small town in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two leaders. The actors, the surprising twists of the plot and, of course, the comforting resolution contribute to a very visible film.
