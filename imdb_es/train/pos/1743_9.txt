After having seen many Greek films I feel very suspicious against most of them. But after seeing this I was amazed. The cinema is great without a big attempt. You can not say that the script is so good or that the picture is perfect or something technical. It is a true story and it is happening in Greek rural areas in forgotten places of God. The movie is like a punch in the stomach and I really wish things were not like that. Obviously, it speaks of the xenophobia of the Greeks (ignorance) to anything different. The problem of this type is not that he is an ex-con. The problem is that he is not one of these people. He is different and they do not want them (that is why all the good things he is doing are becoming boomerang for him). And it also talks about the apathy of the people, because there are some people who are against the hunting of the King, but do not dare to say their opinion. In the end, you can clearly see that the hypocrisy of society is religious and tries to act as God says, but at the same time acts so unfairly with the King. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. In the end, you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them. If you want to remain different and even alone, you are lost (and not far from reality). I think it's a tragedy that the story is real and this should be a bell for everyone. There are no comments for the main actor because he already received a prize and I think his game was excellent. Small comment for Hatzisavvas (play the policeman), it's like a dinosaur, he has played many roles and I am sure that this role for him was very easy, but he does it so well that you can not deny him a big bravo. . I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
