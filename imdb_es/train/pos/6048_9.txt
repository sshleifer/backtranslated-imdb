What kind of British cinema! It's time. And a divergent comedy to start! <br /> <br /> Anyone looking to revive a bit of freedom from their wasted youth, this road movie will test the ticket. <br /> <br /> It's a mix between "Withnail and me" and "Easy Rider". The film takes place at a solid pace and does not let you go away for a long time ... Sometimes there are moments of reflection, but I think they are well justified and add to the characters that the actors play. I was a little concerned about the character of Phil Daniels at first, but fortunately they won half of what was one of the funniest scenes in the whole movie! In general, I found the belly laugh through the movie, most likely to bother some people around me. Oh good. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it completely. This will become a British cult comedy. It is worth a visit.
