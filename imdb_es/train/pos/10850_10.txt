That's a good movie! Finally, an image that reveals an unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. Well-known Rockers are getting old and forgotten, not music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced in Rock around Bill Haley's watch? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best rock n 'roll movie I've ever seen. Much better than Spinal Tap, for example. Why? Because in Still Crazy, people are mature. They have a different point of view about rock, about love and about life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much. Beyond the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like any of us. <br /> <br /> Have a good time watching this (listen to the amazing soundtrack!) and finally think about your own future. <br /> <br /> Goodbye!
