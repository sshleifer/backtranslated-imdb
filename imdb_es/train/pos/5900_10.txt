['I am very sorry that this charming and capricious movie (which I saw for the first time shortly after it was released in the early fifties) has had such a poor reception more recently. In my opinion, it has been very underestimated, but perhaps it is more attractive for the European sense of humor than for (for example) the American: perhaps in Europe we can understand and appreciate more its subtleties and situations, since we are closer to some of them. them in real life! Special mention should be made to the limited but good music, especially the catchy and memorable song &quot;It&#39;s a fine, fine night&quot;, which aired separately on a 78 rpm disc (HMV 78), I think! I would ask any interested person to try it if he has the opportunity: he can have a pleasant surprise.']
