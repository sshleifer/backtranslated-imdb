This series was superior to the rest of the TV detective series of the day, but somehow it did not find an audience. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be entirely new, but it added a lot to the story. And who could forget Pax, the beautiful guide dog of the series! <br /> <br /> While the stories themselves may not have been better than the average series, the settings, in New Orleans, the acting and the music (I note the comment on the musical score in other comments. I remember it clearly) everyone works to make a good TV show even better! <br /> <br /> Well, you never know ... one day, Paramount could just dig into your files and launch it on DVD!
