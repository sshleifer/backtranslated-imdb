Although I bought the DVD when it first came out, and I have seen it several times, I never wrote a review. <br /> <br /> I loved it the first time I saw it and I still love it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that he never made enough money to motivate anyone to follow up. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill, if he makes a movie that is as true to comics and books as My Name is Modesty, with another strong protagonist, anyone who is not familiar with the character You will see this as a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense than on action thrillers. <br /> <br /> The pull of wills between Modesty and Miklos is very true For the source material, it is tense, suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who does not have to have gore or explosions. Alexandra did a great job in interpreting how O'Donnell's character would have taken control of the situation. <br /> <br /> I find this particularly ahead of the curve after the much-needed reboots of Batman and James Bond. After two lousy efforts, although it is not as well known to the public, this is really a re-start of the Modestia character, and it's really sad that probably no more films will be made about it.
