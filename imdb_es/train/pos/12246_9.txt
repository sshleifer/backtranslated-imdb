By the time I started watching this, I realized that I was watching a quality production, so I was not surprised to discover that the script was written by Andrew Davis and that it was produced by Sue Birtwhistle. Both brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice. So my only complaint here is that Emma did not run 3 or 4 or even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The performance was excellent, I think Prunella is as good as Miss Bates, but I loved both Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. The language is a delight to listen to, can you imagine that on this day and at the time you are right with someone without uttering a single word? Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss Smith, in fact, the casting was perfect as much as it was with Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I saw it twice in two days! So once again, thanks to the BBC for another piece of quality television. I've seen Paltrow's version and it's fine, but I think the BBC version is far superior. An excellent production that I am very happy to have on DVD!
