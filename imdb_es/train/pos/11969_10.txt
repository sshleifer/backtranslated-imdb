I loved this program while I was growing up and I still see the DVD of the first season at 19 years old. What can I say? I grew up in a house very similar to the one in Full House. I had a father, two sisters and a dog. I guess the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my father's best friend. Also, I grew up with my mom in the house. I do not know what I would have done without Full House on television. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk Cameron's sister, Candace), and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can relate to each of them because I am the middle child of my family like Steph, I am a younger sister like Michelle and I am a big sister like D.J. I really like how the program always has moral values ​​because I really do not like any of the programs similar to O.C. I also like the Full House comedy. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as the girls' uncle, the friend of dad and dad, respectively. The story goes that, after the girls' mother dies, Danny's best friend, Joey, and his brother-in-law, Jesse, move in to help raise the children. Three men trying to raise three young girls = hilarious. Each character in Full House is full of heart, fun and genuinely credible. Joey is an aspiring comedian with the heart and soul of children. Jesse is the cool, motorcycle guy, tough guy who gets soft with his three nieces, and later, his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, from Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed
