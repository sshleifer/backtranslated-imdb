It has taken me a while to see this version, since unfortunately it does not seem to be able to rent it in the video store, only the other version, but I fell in love with it. I was always on the border with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, since they are not British, naturally have to put the accent, and for me it does not seem natural to me. It seems that it was put. I'm sorry, but do not think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there. I did not like any of the characters, but this version is more comforting and more the kind of person I imagined Emma would be. It is definitely the version to which I will return from now on. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley did not look better, but he is convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax more (played by Olivia Williams). I never got excited about it in the movie version, but it's better represented in this version. Now that I think about it, (in addition to Mr. Knightley) all the characters are better interpreted, let alone at the top. Unfortunately, both came out at the same time and Paltrow's version received more publicity. Too bad ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! Therefore, if you are a fan of Jane Austen, do not forget to look at this one.
