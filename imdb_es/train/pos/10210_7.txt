This is not exactly a great movie, but I admire writers and directors for trying something a little different. The main theme of the film is destiny and the small, seemingly insignificant things that can change the future enormously. In a way, this reminds me of the movie SLIDING DOORS, although instead of focusing on a random event, seemingly random things happen repeatedly and each helps build a nice conclusion. Also, a strange bald guy seems to understand all this and talks about this during a brief scene, as if he were a kind of omnipotent being, but there is no explanation of him in the movie (like the two guys who fight each other in the movie ). the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY). <br /> <br /> The DVD cover shows only Audrey Tautou. This is capitalizing on her success in AMELIE, although she is only one of the many actors in the film and there is no leading role. The pace is fast, the performance is good and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I did not get it was because some of the characters were not interesting and I think the movie could have been adjusted with some subplots less.
