This highly underrated film is (for me) what a good scripture should be in a movie. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and exposes it for all to see and be surprised. The film is about the divisions that people create to isolate themselves from the violence, hatred and fanaticism of everyday life. <br /> <br /> Along the way we are asked question after question about life. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks himself: "Am I making a violent movie (and, by extension, our enjoyment) causing violence in society?" Claire asks: "What kind of world throws something as precious as a human life?" Mack is not immune when he asks: "Is it possible to go beyond the limits of the race and (an even more difficult step) to finance?" Of course, they are not cited in the film, but in generalities. To be honest, it increases more than it responds to. <br /> <br /> But that is the nature of life.We strive all our life to find answers to questions that we will never fully answer, and in certain cases we have to do that the answers fit our needs, needs and desires of our own As human beings, we thrive on questions that we can not answer Some answers are real Claire and Mack realize that even though they could take the easy way letting the state take care of the baby, finding it was the responsibility of his life in his hands Some answers no, Davis 'sees the light' and decides not to make violent films, but the next day he turns around and dismisses his and pifania as subordinate to his art. <br /> <br /> We all look for answers. This movie does not answer them, it just reminds you to keep looking. the answers. <br /> <br />
