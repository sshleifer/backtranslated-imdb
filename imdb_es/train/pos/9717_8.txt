How to Lose Friends & Alienate People is, in all honesty, one of the best comedies I've seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It's not one of those "disgusting" comedies that rely heavily on joke jokes and toilet flushes, but move at a pleasant pace and will easily join the developing narrative. Simon Pegg sticks it into the coffin with his hilarious interpretation of a fish character out of the water and quickly separates himself from the tripod he once belonged to in England (the other two being Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Reaching the top of the Hollywood food chain is hard to do, as we can clearly see with Pegg, his first hit in the lead role was David Schwimmer's comedy, Run Fatboy Run, but he received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences for same. His second attempt is this movie, he received quite positive reviews from the majority but it was a failure at the box office. I, on the one hand, still have not lost faith in him and will continue there when he wants to take that third shot for glory. <br /> <br /> Other characters were well chosen from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, in my opinion, Kirsten Dunst did well in this film as the angle of love for the character of Pegg, however, the spark I saw in Interview with the vampire is still lost. She needs to find it, fast or she could suffer the consequences of being lost in the land of "comedians" forever.
