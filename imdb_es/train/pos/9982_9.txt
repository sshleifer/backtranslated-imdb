['I saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in Canada (still only in a limited version). It was worth the wait and something more. I am a very eager reader of Margaret Laurence and I was thrilled to see that this novel was becoming a movie. In fact, I liked the movie better than the novel. I liked that the character of Bram Shipley was a little less harsh, and that there seemed to be more of a love story between Hagar and Bram, which made the scenes at the end of Bram&#39;s life much more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Agar was not more sympathetic in the movie than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. She was Agar through and through. Christine Horne was brilliant and has many more things ahead, I&#39;m sure. His scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on and on, in general a 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and I can not wait for it to come out on DVD, something my collection should have!']
