This was the most impressive, moving, amazing and amazing story I have experienced. Frankly, even those adjectives simply can not describe it. I can not simply choose a scene that stood out for me. I guess if I had to list some, it would be the firefighter's reactions to the sound of the jumping victims; the reaction of the people trapped in the elevator, who did not know what was happening, when they finally emerged to the horrible scene; the shock and disbelief of the spectators; And finally the silence. <br /> <br /> On that day, and even now, I remember Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says:'I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly screamed in terror and were suddenly silenced. ' It's amazing how accurate he is in his description. There really was a disturbance in the Force. <br /> <br /> This documentary vividly reveals this disturbance. The feelings are incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion and the realization of its very magnitude. It's all there. Do not miss anything. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful and moving documentary that deserves the Emmy. Not only because it documents 9/11, but because it is simply everything it should be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to look, be sure to grab a box of tissues. You will need them. I know I did it.
