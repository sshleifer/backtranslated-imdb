['I really enjoyed Girl Fight. It&#39;s something I could see again and again. The performance was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. Very convincing could I say. The film shows how women should defend what they want to do in life. She had so much compassion and yet so much hatred at the same time. Dealing with an ignorant father did not really help her much. Even though I loved her, I was really hateful. Her mother died when she was younger and that also put a little sadness on the paper. The love story was a part that I really enjoyed in the movie as well. I felt the passion they had for each other. Then, once again, the drama begins and then it is as if you are choosing between your boyfriend and your lifelong dream. I thought it ended just right. It was the kind of end in which he has to decide what happened to them in the future. To all of you, who like a movie based on a sport with a good plot, I would suggest you watch this one.']
