'Before the devil knows you're dead' is one of the best movies I've seen in a while <br /> <br />. The performance of <br /> <br /> the excellent cast is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman is having an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time he is on the screen. Ethan Hawke coincides with him scene by scene and Albert Finney simply chews the screen. Marisa Tomei is, however, criminally underutilized, but she looks amazing for her 42 years. The script is excellent, the line of the story is not linear but easy enough to follow. Sidney Lumet, although not known for his box office successes, has turned out to be a gem with this one!
