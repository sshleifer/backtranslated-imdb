If this film proves only one thing, it is that Keaton is, was and always will be a comedic at heart, even when he dodges bullets, goes to the electric chair and reaches the wrong end of a line of information in prison. <br /> <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" is going to prove even more. In the 80s, the ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the pinnacle in the world of genre parodies. But there were several claimants to the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High") Heckerling tests his hand, with an astonishing number of television writers behind the script (see and verify). <br /> <br /> This happy slapstick parody of the "gag" and "gag" sters movies of the 1930s produces almost all the clich√©s for a loop and even adds some cliches that did not exist for a long time . <br /> <br /> And not only is the always reliable Keaton on hand as the Johnny of the title, but so are the funny guys and dolls like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and almost all the other actors in Hollywood who passed nearby. You will be surprised how many faces you will recognize. I know it was. <br /> <br /> And the jokes? Well, when they start, they attack you fast and furious, like a machine gun. There are too many to tell at the beginning, topped with a crazy song by Weird Al Yankovic. But you have to watch when they recharge. And they have to recharge a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everyone tries, it seems that they are having fun and I was laughing a lot of time. However, in the end, there was a lot of time to think about how certain scenes could have been more fun, which is not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night when there's nothing good on TV, interject "Johnny" and get ready for a "dangerous" laugh. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Take a look at "Johnny Dangerously" ... do not be a "bastard".
