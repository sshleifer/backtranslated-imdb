One of the best science fiction works of all time, as visionary and stimulating as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but has been surpassed by Pitt's incredible and frantic turn that does not look like anything he did before or after. However, even Stowe is not out of his league here. History has many layers and offers much to think about. The climatic scene is wonderfully magnificent, and the last lines fit perfectly. The scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way. Lots of black humor on display here. Fantastic production design and cinematography suitably strange. In my top ten.
