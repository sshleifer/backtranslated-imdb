This caricature is short on the plot, but it is a visually stunning work. There will be very, very small spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short has a "story" that is incredibly light: the underground gnomes are responsible for the return of spring every year, but they must face a winter not yet ready to retire . Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That is practically the plot, as it is. But this caricature is not about the plot, it's about color and animation. The images are exceptional. In 1936, that bright color was still a novelty and here is an incredibly inspired work. <br /> <br /> My favorite short moments surround the movement of the colors liquefied through the pipes. At more than one point, there is a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the highest, and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it look like the row is a pipe organ . <br /> <br /> The images of the battle between the emergent vegetation and the winter storm that refuses to go silent are extremely well executed. These types of shorts were things that distinguish Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising, but probably also helped achieve their last MGM outing, because this cartoon probably exceeded the budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the department of animation were handled by someone a little more aware of the cost than Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful cartoon and it's worth seeing. It is available in the Attack of the characters of the 30s DVD. Recommended, especially if you like good animation.
