Are we really doing 'video nasties' again? In the form of a large-budget 8MM digital wide-screen remake, this is a great ride. Unfortunately, there is too much history and, sometimes, this becomes a travel notebook while our heroine searches the places of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am being quite rude to the "depraved" scenes, which include everything from hot wax, hard spanking and rough sex to drowning, decapitation and some. These scenes are immaculate and it is a pity that Bruno and his budget can not stretch to make all the many introduced character creatures become more than just cartoons.
