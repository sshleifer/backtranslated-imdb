This is simply a classic movie where human voices that come from animals are really what thoughts are. I do not know if my video copy is missing a scene but it never shows how the dogs came out of the hole. It also shows a survival instinct and animal tracking skills. Put the humans in the same position where the helicopters would be outside. For once, an original movie has been improved with a new version, since the voiceover of the first one has been removed. Only the use of animals can work in a film of this type because the use of people would have had to spice up the story turning it into a murder, showing that, after all, animals are more interesting than people
