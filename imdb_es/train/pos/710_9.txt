Although I do not agree with the decision of Bob and Tammy to leave the baby Jesse, and it is something that never would do, they tried to do the best thing for the baby. The way this movie is written, you get caught up in the story and wondering what you really believe, from all aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Almost unheard of, as far as I'm concerned. But during the movie, she really convinces you that she is psychotic, or at least, that there is something really wrong with her. His character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed". The movie seems to end quickly, leaving things somewhat unresolved. But other than that, this movie is really cool. It really makes you think. It is not a movie to see when you just want to rest, relax and see something cute that will make you laugh. But it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from the perspective of others and discover something about yourself. Caution: you can even grow while watching this movie. And everything is worth it, in the end.
