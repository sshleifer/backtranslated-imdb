I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It is hard to believe that this is the directorial debut of Mrs. Blom, it is beautifully developed and realized. A great cast of characters could be outside of an Anne Tyler novel, that is, it is replete with later history and potential futures, there are no false notes, surprising outbursts of humor in the midst of self-inflicted anxiety and very real if not terrible dilemmas. If you saw "The Best of Youth", you will recognize how well the characters are drawn through small moments, even as the story progresses energetically. I really hope this is distributed in the United States. I live in a fairly sophisticated film market, but rarely do we get Swedish films of any kind.
