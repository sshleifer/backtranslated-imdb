Men of honor have many important aspects. Good action sequences, many "feel good" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the film the great performance. Especially by Robert Deniro. The story of Men of Honor focuses on Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first deep-sea African-American diver in the Navy. It narrates his hard fight from being a poor farmer to entering the diving school and even more. It's a good story, but it seems to have been done many times before. A person, despite all odds, will not give up until he achieves his goals that they established for some sentimental reason many years ago. It could happen, but many of the difficulties that Brashear faces in the film are questionable, including the C.O. From the diving school manipulating with his final test. However, all that is prepared for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the film. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday, who is the master of the diving school Brashear attends. As soon as Deniro enters, he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can not hate unless you have incredible power. Before the film is over, Deniro gives many speeches that would make you laugh at how great he is, but you are too stunned by the way he hits them. In the end, you should doubt some aspects of the movie, but admit it, if it were the whole truth, it would make you sleep your seat in the first twenty minutes.
