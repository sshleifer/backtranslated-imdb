I really love this movie. I remember that once when I was in 2nd grade, my teacher showed it to us on a roll of 16 mm film. This film, however, can be a little scary for 2nd graders, like the scene in which Bill murders Nancy and sees Fagin's face for the first time on the screen. One of my relatives is tired of watching this movie because she studied it in music class. If I were a teacher and could qualify the people who produced this wonderful movie, I would give them an A +.
