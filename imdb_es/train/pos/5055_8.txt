I did not expect much when I first saw the cover of the DVD. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl ?? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then the story started, it developed into a beautifully photographed and rhythm movie. I was surprised and loved this (basically) true story. It made me want to read more about this fascinating character, which means that the director fulfilled his purpose, and the film was a success!
