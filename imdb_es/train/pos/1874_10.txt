Everyone should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and can help us realize that 1) my life is not as bad as I thought and 2) how important it is to adopt a child in need. There are so many out there. To think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deeply about life and how the world has been and always will be. Corrupted, but that corruption does not have to reach your home. We all have a choice! I definitely recommend this ... and while doing so, I would like to include "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all films that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life.
