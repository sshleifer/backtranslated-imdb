This film is, in short, a cinematographic masterpiece. The film moves brilliantly through intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film begins during the Spanish Civil War when a group of children seek revenge on another child. In fact, they are representing in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later we find three of these children again as adults in a sanitarium. Here we see what life has forged in each one of them. One of them is a lonely and sexually repressed patient. Another man is a scammer who has become ill. The third child, a young girl, has become a nun and is serving in the sanitarium. This movie is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche. <br /> <br /> This movie has a climax that is definitely not for the apprehensive members of the audience, but it is logical and deeply moving. The acting is excellent and the script is pretty well written. There is a musical score that provides a current of terror throughout this film. This is not a movie for seekers of emotions, but a movie for a reflective audience.
