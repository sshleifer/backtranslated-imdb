['Passing stones is definitely one of the best independent comedy films in history. Must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this. This movie for some reason has not received its due credit. First, let&#39;s start with the story line: everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves letters behind a hidden treasure, not only does he reunite two families, but he begins a whirlwind adventure. Mix a Polish translator, a comatose mother, a crack head with turrets syndrome, a twisted homosexual hypnotist and a drag queen, money not only makes the world go round but can turn the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie would have to be the sister / crack addict with the turret syndrome, its sudden outburst will make you cry and imitate for weeks.']
