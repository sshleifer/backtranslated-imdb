History of HG Wells. The shape of things to come became a movie in 1935. A well-made science fiction tale about a decades-long war. A great cast includes Raymond Massey (arsenic and ancient lace) Sir Cedric Hardwick (ghost of Frankenstein) Ralph Richardson (bandits of the time) and Margaretta Scott. Different glimpses of helicopters, holograms, a rocket and futuristic cities. This film was ahead of its time. Directed by William Cameron Menzies (invaders of Mars) is very nice as a metropolis of the previous film (1927), but avoid the so-called continuation of the form of things to come, which was made in 1979. This film has nothing to do with the original.hg wells like Jules Verne had a vision for the future with their stories. A classic science fiction movie. 10 out of 10
