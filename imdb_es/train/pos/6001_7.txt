It is by no means a masterpiece, and far from the best of Errol Flynn, Istanbul still has much in its favor. The places and the beautiful cinematography in Technicolor, go back to a past time. Errol Flynn shows moments of his past glory, and it's fine, since Jim Brennan, a pilot who has returned to chase him. The image is actually a new version of "Singapore" from 1947, and the story seems very elaborate and clich√©d by today's standards. In addition, many of the supporting actors seem to be simply "following the movements" in this image. Many people have also compared him to one of the greats of all time, CASABLANCA. While watching the movie, I could see many of the similarities, but hey, Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take it for what it's worth. Finally, if you're a fan of Flynn, or the old love stories, you might want to take a look at this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or The Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some of Hollywood's classics ...
