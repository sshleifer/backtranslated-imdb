['This movie is a shake of the fun of punk rock, from start to finish. The Ramones, reigning princes of Punk rock of the late 70s, appear as themselves. PJ Soles plays Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock and roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for the Ramones, her favorite rock band. He keeps the school rocking and encourages his classmates to join her in their joyful pranks. <br /><br /> Meanwhile, the school Riff attends has just hired a new Principal, named Ms. Togar. It is a tall and intimidating Amazon. And she is committed to making students &#39;toe-the-line&#39;. He even has a couple of students who act as monitors, who inform him with dirt about his classmates. Ms. Togar is especially determined to catch Riff and stop Riff&#39;s anarchic shenanigans. But Riff has smart ways to frustrate Togar, at every step. <br /><br /> Congratulations to the excellent performance of Mary Woronov, in her role as Director Togar. Mary is a legendary film actress. And in this film, she plays the fascist Mrs. Togar, with scornful contempt. PJ Soles as Riff, turns into an electrifying performance. Clint Howard, like the duplicate Eaglebauer, has a lot of fun with his role. <br /><br /> The Ramones play many of their successful songs in this movie. And so, the viewer sees why the Ramones were so influential in the punk rock scene of the 70s. Certainly, this is a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you do not like Ramones or Punk rock, this movie is a tremendous explosion (literally) of energetic fun.']
