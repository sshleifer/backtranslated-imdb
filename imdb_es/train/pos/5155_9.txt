"Hitler: The Rise of Evil" was embroiled in a controversy before it was aired, and that controversy may obscure the film's achievement. <br /> <br /> Those who criticized the movie, who had not seen it, did so. So with good intentions, based on the wrong thought that I would be too understanding with Hitler. However, they misunderstood the point: humanizing the evil Hitler does not sympathize with him. It is much more disturbing to realize that the indescribable acts committed by one of the greatest villains in history were committed by a human being. A manic sick and ill, no doubt, but a human being, nonetheless. It is necessary to know the history of how Hitler could come to power to prevent it from happening again. <br /> <br /> "Rise of Evil" stands out for a brilliant and better professional performance of Robert Carlyle, who turns Hitler into a human being without redeeming him in any way. Carlyle perfectly captures the appearance and manners of the Nazi leader, never letting the impersonation become a caricature or a distance between us (something that Anthony Hopkins could not achieve when he played Hitler in "The Bunker", another very good movie made for television movie). While rejected by Hitler's depravity and virulent anti-Semitism, Carlyle grants him a certain magnetism and power that the real Adolf Hitler must have possessed. After all, if a nation had not followed it? <br /> <br /> Of the various subplots, the most convincing features by far are those of Matthew Modine as the reporter Fritz Gehrlich, who does the work of his life to draw attention to reality. of Hitler and Nazism. While Modine's performance is a bit forced in part 1, in part 2 it seems to have adapted, the character gives us a real-life hero in a movie full of villains. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also provide strong support. <br /> <br /> Part 1 of this two-part miniseries suffered a bit from being too choppy, including a look at Hitler's childhood that lasts only the duration of the opening credits and in part 2, sections which detail Hitler's relationship with his niece and his lover, Eva Braun, are less successful than the central plot, but they serve to give us a deeper idea of ​​his mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, no film about Hitler can make us understand it. The average person is, fortunately, unable to understand a man who would try to exterminate a whole race of people. "Hitler: The Rise of Evil" tries less to make us understand Hitler, and more to make us understand how he came to be power. It is an important story that must be told, and it is impossible to believe that someone who has seen the film would accuse her of having anything other than the best of intentions and the ability to do something that is not good. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10. *** 1/2
