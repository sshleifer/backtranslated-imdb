What a surprising surprise to find on late television. If only I had read a brief summary of the plot in a television listing before watching the movie, it would have happened. The idea of ​​a movie about a successful man-seeing-a shrink who wants to leave the business and fall in love ... sounds trite. But the movie works. From the beginning of the film, it is clear that the man carries a weight on his shoulders, even before he says a word. The appearance of the movie is perfect. dark, but not so unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Aside from the familiar aspect of the hit man that provides a touch of surrealism, Macy's character deals with his marriage and his father's control. Macy shows a repressed sadness, and her conversations at bedtime with her son are incredible. The child shows acting skills beyond his years, and the interaction between father and son is very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. , and I can not believe that I found it by accident on television at night.
