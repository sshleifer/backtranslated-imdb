Very well and intelligently interpreted by the two girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie, and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the plot is rather a stretch of the imagination. To be honest, Young Hazel looking for mayor seems out of place. <br /> <br /> While the performance is well done by everyone involved, the film tends to lack a genuine atmosphere of drama. Maybe we have come to expect a great reality in the movies, as if we were comparing Pollyanna with How Green Was My Valley. It does not matter, each of them is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright even if her role is somewhat moderate here. Entertainment in the middle of the road, very suitable for younger viewers, and how nice it is sometimes to be exposed to good classical music, which is almost a rarity! <br /> <br /> I think this film is a welcome change, as it reflects more silent, reflective values ​​for years of growth, and non-violence, thank God. A warm family movie to enjoy.
