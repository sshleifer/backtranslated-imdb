I just watched this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on that, so I thought I'd check it. I thought it was a really beautiful movie and I can not wait to see it again. The actors were really good and I loved all the music! There was not much to talk about in the movie, which at first seemed a bit strange, but once I got involved, I thought the story and the acting were really emotional and meaningful, and I thought that left a lot to the imagination. I want to see the movie again because so many things happened that I forgot many small things, but I know that I left the cinema thinking about the movie. It was filmed to perfection and everything was really unique.
