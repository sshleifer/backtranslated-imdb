I will not reveal anything describing the plot of this film, apart from saying that it begins with the return to Israel of a blind young woman whose friend and closest companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a detective story while the blind woman tries to find out why her friend ended her life. As your investigation continues and information accumulates, this leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion. The film has an expert rhythm and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is excellent. The Israeli film has definitely come of age and is now totally competitive with other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the US. UU
