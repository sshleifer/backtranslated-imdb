For a long time, it seemed that all the good Canadian actors had gone south of the border and (I guess) everyone in the second row filled the most important positions and that left the feces for sexual comedies. <br /> <br /> This movie was a real surprise: despite the extravagant plots that are typical of the farces, the actors seemed to be trying to put something in their characters and what we, the viewer, came back was almost a true suspension of beliefs. When the extras in the music video attacked the eviction police, you almost thought it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of some of the best sex farces (Canadians or not), you should definitely look for this one. outside. And the big surprise, this sexual farce is also loaded with a very good nudity.
