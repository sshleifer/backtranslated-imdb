I really thought that this movie was excellent. Not only is the story correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Victoria Blunt's performance of Victoria and how she maintained her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile in her youth. Blunt describes the charismatic and, sometimes, dogmatic way, for which Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. The romantic elements of the film are so genuine and tender that, at the end of the film, you really understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of his days in Albert's mourning. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are worth mentioning as well. I appreciated the beautiful score, which moves beautifully together with the dramatic movement of history. I also considered cinematography as outstanding, some scenes leave me breathless due to the exuberance and splendor they represent. <br /> <br /> This year there have been so few movies as beautiful and tender as this one. as one of the best of 2009!
