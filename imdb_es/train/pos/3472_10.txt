['Very mild spoiler <br /><br /> This movie (despite being alone on television) is absolutely excellent. I did not really pay attention to differences in appearance or accent, so I really can not comment on that. The acting in this was so good that I had to pinch myself and say: &quot;Remember, it&#39;s just a movie, this has NOT HAPPENED REALLY&quot;. When I sat down and listened to Harris and Quinn talk, I knew it was exactly what John and Paul would talk about if they had had this meeting. The sharp comments and the burns of John were in agreement with his character (especially in the restaurant!), Like his depression, while Paul was very calm and relaxed. Both actors did an excellent job and I loved seeing this movie. It is a perverse experience for any Beatles fan. And get ready for some surprises!']
