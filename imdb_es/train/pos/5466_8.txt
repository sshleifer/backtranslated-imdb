Excellent pre-codified amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyck as the newly inspired (by the writings of Nietzsche!) To expel their sensibilities and exploit, to use men in their favor. It is not really fair to the German philosopher, but it is interesting that this was the year that Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version does not do much for me, but it certainly performs well here, always driving itself and the film forward. There is not as much meat on display here as you might have expected, but a lot of risky situations and amazing occurrences and innuendo. Very funny, if it is not a particularly attractive presentation of men and I suppose that, in all honesty, it is not a very attractive vision of the female gold digger. Still, that's life!
