The surprise candidate of the Best Animation Film race this year at the Oscars. It's an Irish film by heart, but it was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, with, I suppose, animators working in the three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique movies in recent memory. The design of the characters is reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis a couple of years ago, with very simple characters with thick black outlines. This movie is not black and white. Oh no. What makes this film great is its use of color, just one of the most scandalous and surprising uses I've ever seen. The general design of the images is also much more geometric, with characters that are basically rectangles or ovals. Much of the film can be spent playing to find the circle: an important aspect of visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All these geometric designs have a purpose: the story is about a child who is learning to be an artist who works in illuminated manuscripts (the Book of Kells is a true illuminated Bible, the art of the film is based on the drawings it contains. ). The story of the film is not particularly profound, but it's a pretty good fantasy story. Brendan is a boy in Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to keep the Vikings away. A newcomer to Kells, Brother Aiden, inspires Brendan to dedicate himself to illustration. It also inspires him to do things like leave Kells and explore the nearby forest, inside which lives a nymph. Bruno Coulais provides a fantastic score, almost as good as he did for Coraline, which I consider the best of the year.
