This "coming of age" film is about the experiences of two girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love in a fateful summer. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his excellent work in "To Kill a Mockingbird", the film never touches a false note. All the acting is excellent. Like Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes an impressive film debut. Seeing this beautifully photographed, superbly directed and edited film, I felt that I was looking through a window into reality, instead of watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie at least 5 times, and I can honestly say that it is one of the best films that have been made about being young, being in love and going through the feelings, challenges and changes of adulthood young. Families with children between 10 and 15 years old should see it together and use it as a topic of discussion, since it raises a series of questions about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc.
