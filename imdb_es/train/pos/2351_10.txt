First, I want to clarify that the inability of the average user to appreciate the imagination is frightening. What makes this show so unique is the hyperreality it creates. You do not need to know why Ned can return people from death, or why it can only be for a minute. Where has the wonder of the whimsical tales of childhood gone, like A Wrinkle in Time? <br /> <br /> I say it's refreshingly original because it's a polar opposite to the masses of television that do it all. It does not leave space for imagination or wonder. <br /> <br /> It is good to add a bit of escapism to the television experience. <br /> <br /> Hyperreality is my favorite aspect of the program. The scenario of the 50s, the innocent and rare characters, and the setting and the physical environment that should not be taken as pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show masks the morbid nature of death, while others embrace it. While they are entertaining, other television shows have been removed from this series. It has really restored the sense of curiosity, imagination and wonder of television. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies quickly reached the top of my list.
