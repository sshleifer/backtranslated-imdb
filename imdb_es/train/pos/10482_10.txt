I love this movie. It is one of those that I can see again and again. It is well acted by a good cast that does not try too hard to be a star. <br /> <br /> The premise of a newly widowed housewife selling marijuana to make ends meet could have become an Americanized turd from a movie or an action thriller. Either one would have killed the movie completely. <br /> <br /> The film is developed as an Ealing comedy with a fantastic wellness factor in everything. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the scene alone with The two old ladies and a box of cornflakes ... (that's not a spoiler!)
