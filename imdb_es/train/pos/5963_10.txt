This movie is horrible, but you have to see it for that. I'm not here to talk about the whole movie, just the best chase scene. When Eddie moves out of milk with Tim, they chase him down the hall. Eddie puts obstacles in the way of athletes with hilarious consequences (like a plate that hits a trumpeter, buy the DVD and watch it slow). The best obstacle is a downed mop bucket on which a jumper jumps, but slides on the ground through a door. But when it glides it increases speed defying physics (mainly friction); However, what is behind the door is supreme. The steepest box of stairs of any school, that this athlete proceeds to CLEAN in the air. Actually, he would probably die from a broken neck. It not only challenges all the concepts of reality, but makes the most fun noise that has been made in that situation. Go and buy this. Trust me, this scene is worth your 6 dollars.
