John Garfield plays a Marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting in Guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotyped notions about blindness and he is sure that it will be a burden for everyone. Hospital staff and their wounded Marines comrades can not communicate with him. Nor can your girl at home played by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blind because of his own fears, self-pity and prejudice. It is a complex role that Garfield performs memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching despite the syrupy melodrama always present. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal, where he finds himself in a nest of machine guns trying to defend himself against Japanese soldiers advancing in a hellish-looking night battle, and later a sequence of dreams in the hospital where he sees himself walking through a train platform with a white. Cane, dark glasses and a tin cup, while his girlfriend walks back away from the camera.
