['This movie is a great The plot is very faithful to the book that is a classic written by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene in which Hank sings a song with a group of children called &quot;when you touch the moon.&quot; It reminds me of Sinatra&#39;s High Hopes song, it&#39;s fun and inspiring. The music is great at all times and my favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir &quot;Saggy&quot; Sagamore. OVerall a great family movie or even a great date movie. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is beautiful. I love this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye at Court Jester, you will definitely like this movie.']
