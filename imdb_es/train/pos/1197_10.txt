['I just watched this movie, by mistake. What a little gem. This film made in 1956 looks, and feels, like a movie of the late seventies. And, in fact, it is better, more moderate and correct than, for example, Blue Soldier. The environmental, anthropological nuances are far ahead of their time. Discrete cinematography is excellent and terribly realistic. Much more than dances with wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the appearance of the buffalo &quot;killing fields&quot; of the late nineteenth century. Probably because those in the movie were real killing fields. The film was filmed during the legal sacrifice of the buffaloes of legal forestry, so the animals that are actually seen are shot, the bones are real. In conclusion, a western masterpiece greatly underestimated, superbly acted, directed and fired.']
