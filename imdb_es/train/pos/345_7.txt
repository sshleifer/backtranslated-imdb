The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. However, it improved after the Valentine's Day party began. Aside from the twist on the murderer's identity at the end, the murder scene in a hot bath was one of the relatively memorable aspects of this movie. The scene in the garden with Kate was well filmed and so was the last scene (the 'twist'). In those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and emotion, and the scene of the murder in a hot bath had an unpleasant aspect (the way they should be). The previous murders are frustratingly devoid of blood.
