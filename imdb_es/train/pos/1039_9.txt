I have seen this movie several times and I have seen it today (in TCM) only by Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is a very underestimated actress and I have to admit that I have fallen in love with her since I saw her for the first time (probably in "Wuthering Heights" 40 years or more ago). The real star in this film, however, is Paul Lukas, and he deserved all the accolades he received. Make it clear, like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Naziism had to be stopped, and everything that helped to do it was good. He gave his children a line about being bad, and that they should not be bad, but as he said before, when talking with adults, he would do this kind of thing without hesitation. Lukas gave an excellent description of a man trapped in this situation, and made it clear that what he did was very difficult to do. <br /> <br /> Some people think that their victim was a Nazi, but I do not. I do not think so, I think I was just looking for the money. His Nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him. <br /> <br /> An interesting point in the film, and presumably also in the work, is the fact that Muller (Lucas) is a German. While the anti-German hysteria of World War I was not repeated in World War II, there was considerable anti-German sentiment and some Germans were buried in a manner similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese descent. It was an act of bravery for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this time (maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the Nazi-Soviet pact!). After all, the American and British air forces were bombing German cities and had no qualms about killing innocent civilians. However, I believe that the bombing and the firestorm in Dresden occurred later, after "Watch on the Rhine" was launched. <br /> <br /> The title is a kind of word game, since the "watch" looks to the west, from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a march song of the German army, used in the Second World War, but the Nazis had their own song of march that was also used. But Muller is a German and is engaged in his own "Wach am Rhein". <br /> <br /> All the other actors did an excellent job here; Although Bodo was too much, there are children like him. I'm surprised he did not reveal his father's secret. In real life, he may well have done it.
