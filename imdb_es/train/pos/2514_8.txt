I voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childhood defects. Apart from that, this movie is one of my favorites! It is entertaining to say the least. However, the shooting scenes are ridiculous, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes too much of his "Matrix obsession". It seems that his enemies stay there ... waiting to be shot. However, this movie is moving and always makes me cry. It has a lot of GREAT humor and it makes me laugh too. Gackt is an excellent actor, I must say ... he shows so much emotion. This was the first time that Hyde performed and he did well. The paper fits well. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. The whole cast is what I would say, perfect for this movie. DO NOT MISS IT! YOU WILL REGRET!
