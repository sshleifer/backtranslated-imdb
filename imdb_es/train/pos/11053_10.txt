I was not born until 4 years after this wonderful program was broadcast for the first time, but fortunately I was able to capture the repetitions of the mid 90's and the rest is history ... I was hooked. The premise was quite simple; two hardened Nemesis agents, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are associated with an expert (if not young) doctor and biologist (Sharron Macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to regain the use of an agent dangerous biological By red china. While they escape, their plane is affected by machine gun fire and they hit the heart of the Himalayas, where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilization that heals and improves the senses of the trio, thus preparing the scene for many. The exciting adventures that lie ahead ... <br /> <br /> The series lasted 30-hour episodes and I think it was his relatively short life, a seasonal race that has established him for the cult status. <br /> Monty Berman, the producer, was famous for doing things as cheaply as possible and, sometimes, the program suffered for this with incredibly catchy sets, especially in Episodes like "Happening" (a study that is in charge of the Australian Outback) and the "" operations "Operation" Freeze "and" The Beginning "sets, but if you can overcome this and focus on the characters and story lines, the show was really fun. He had a great mix of adventures and a lot of deadpan humor (mainly from some of William Gaunt's fabulous liners). <br /> <br /> The chemistry of the three derivations was fantastic: you have the feeling that they were really having fun doing the program and this is confirmed in the documentary of the 2005 meeting, where the three meet after more 35 years to remember the program (and laugh at the horrible wig by Anthony Nicholls!). Everyone shared the same screen time and everyone had their moments to shine. I must say that I was always a fan of Richard Barrett. I loved his sardonic humor along with that dangerous edge. It was certainly a man you did not cross, and those eyes ... the eyes bluer than you. You would probably see it on TV. I have also followed Bill Gaunts' career with interest ever since. However, Craig Stirling would certainly have had his legion of female fans and I am sure that Alexandra Bastedo had a whole line of male fans who fainted on her too. <br /> <br /> The show also had a lot of guest stars to seduce. with, including Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. <br /> <br /> Notable episodes for me were: "Auto Kill", "The Interrogation", "The Fanatics", "The Mission" and "The Gilded Cage" but I'm sure everyone has their personal favorites . <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this program For the first time, or to see it again after many years, remember to see it in the context of the moment it was made and just sit back and enjoy: the characters and the chemistry of the three drivers is what made this wonderful show. I do not think I'll ever get tired of it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it!
