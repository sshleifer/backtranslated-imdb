I saw SHORE LEAVE the other day. I've seen it so many times, and I never tire of doing it. Oddly enough, every time I see him lately, he takes me back to the first time I saw him. Including this time. It must be that sense of mystery and "What is happening here?" about. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the only part of the story that ALWAYS felt uncomfortable and uncomfortable for me, this time, actually had a GREAT effect on me ... Ruth. I think a lot of that was Gerald Fried's score. A true masterpiece, that! The romantic section was reused, much more widely, on THIS SIDE OF PARADISE. But of course, it debuted here. I get the impression that, of all the girls that Kirk met over the years, it may have been the "sweetest". When she said, "Do you have to go?", Combined with the music, I could really feel the pain that she must have felt when she could not have it with her. <br /> <br /> Someone commented online Ruth seemed older than him, but she was not supposed to have aged in 15 years. What makes me think ... maybe she was one of the academy's teachers. Kirk had an affair with an older woman! (Maybe he thought of this in "MIRI" when he told Janice: "I never get involved with older women." Maybe he meant, "... more." <br /> <br /> Reading ST reviews the other questions Day, I see where somebody compared WHAT ARE THE SMALL GIRLS MADE WITH? I, MUDD, but it seems that SHORE LEAVE should be there too, what are all those "people", if not the androids? And could it be related? The Caretaker "?" The Old Ones "from the previous episode? Whoever it is, it seems to be one of the RARE cases in ST where you have a race that is actually" superior "instead of just thinking they are. <br /> Yeoman Barrows seems to be complying with Yeoman Rand, given the amount of attention that Dr. McCoy gave him, it's just a more frustrating example of a potentially good character appearing once and then never appearing again. Sheesh. <br /> <br /> One thing that was missing in the last ones that I've seen slipping here was Spoc k smiling. I saw it. I really prefer to know that there are 2 sides to I am going inside all the time, instead of this "submerged" business. When he said: "Have fun, sir." Near the beginning, it could be seen that he not only addressed his superior officer, but talked to his friend. And in the end, when he unnecessarily says "Totally illogical!", I can not help thinking that he does it only to provoke a reaction. He may not be smiling or laughing, but I think he likes to see his teammates around him happy.
