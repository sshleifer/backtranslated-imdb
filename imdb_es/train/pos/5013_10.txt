If people did not know who Barbra Streisand was before this, ... (is it POSSIBLE?) ... surely they knew who was chasing! <br /> <br /> This program won 5 Emmys, and stands out as one of the best things that Streisand has done. <br /> <br /> It consists of 3 acts ... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbra singing standards from the room to the room, full of musicians, including a segment where she It's a girl again, all ending with a splendid version of her song, (at that time) ... "Gente". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical tour by Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings songs of poverty ... it's better than it seems ... <br /> <br /> ACT III ..... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some great songs, like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", and a mix of "Funny Girl" ... <br /> < In general, a large part of the history of television, Made by one of the best artists in the world!
