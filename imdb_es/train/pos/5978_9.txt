This is a true "movie of the 80s": at that time they made about 100 times more movies than at present, and that makes many of them quite interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon, which no longer exists. Today, perhaps the same kind of people who would have made cheap "direct-to-video" movies in the eighties are doing cheap pornography. Pornography seems to sell. Anyway, this is above the middle level of the garbage film: it has a good and fascinating story, and I think it's pretty well made. In one scene, you can even see the microphone swinging at the top edge of the image. Of course, there are also small cameos from Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute much to the "success" of the film, although they are good at their small roles. The monster, the heavy singer "Sammi Curr", looks really terrible, especially when he is singing. One of the most terrifying monsters I've seen in horror movies. You may have nightmares about him the next night. Not recommended for lovers of intellectual cinema.
