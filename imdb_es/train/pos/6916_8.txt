Winchester '73 was the film that moved Mann from the B-series films to the big league, rescuing James Stewart's post-war career in the process by seeing him as a hero in conflict (although since he inherited Fritz Lang's project, maybe Lang deserves credit for that). Both men would go to much darker places: Mann, with the very gloomy Devil's Doorway, which remained archived by MGM until the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to release it. but a movie about a man chasing his own brother when the title rifle is handed out from person to person along the way before it ends in one of the beloved shootings on the mountainside is even stronger than what would be expected from the study system. Great dialogue, an impressive cast? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them. and Mann's exceptional visual sense raises the bar with this.
