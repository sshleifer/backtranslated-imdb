I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968 on a big movie screen in Boston when I was a teenager. Later, during the summer of 1969, I was pleased to see that this film was still presented at a prominent cinema in Leicester Square, London, after having won the Academy Award for Best Picture of the previous year. <br /> <br /> The success of "Oliver!" Both on stage and on screen I was reminded that not all talents start on Broadway and end in Hollywood. This legendary story of Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was admirably presented on the London stage by Lionel Bart of Great Britain. His musical delight then became a hit in New York and around the world. The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967 and then premiered in 1968. The sets and musical numbers are incredible. The song "Who is going to buy?" It required hundreds of actors and the British film director really deserved his Oscar for putting everything impeccably. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but above all it is a tribute to the craftsmanship of British film studios, such as Shepperton. Good show! Other film studios in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years.
