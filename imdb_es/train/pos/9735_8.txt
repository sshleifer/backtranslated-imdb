['Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe &quot;How to lose friends and alienate people&quot;. The underlying romance in the plot is, for the most part, displaced by a much more interesting tale of &quot;rags to riches.&quot; Although the central line of the story is somewhat hasty, in several screenshots, it has a sense of; removing the &quot;core of life&quot;, focusing on those key relationships that form the &quot;office politics&quot; and using those almost irrelevant scenes, which are used only for the comic effect. However, it works very well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. Ultimately, the film is very intelligent, plays well in the transatlantic relationship that Pegg shares with his castmates and fuses the cross between the high and low life society, quite well and quite refreshingly in a story that, Despite predictability, it is something unique. trip. The different characters in the film are well presented and the casting is definitely a positive point in the film. Both the relationship of &quot;commercial places&quot; between Pegg and Huston and the relationship of &quot;love, hate&quot; between Pegg and Dunst work so well in a story that, for lack of a better word, is charming. Even Fox, whose main resource is, of course, sexual attractiveness, is surprised by what turns out to be a rather dark character and acts like &quot;bimbo&quot;. It is one of these films where every little detail pays homage to a great work. From transsexual strippers to an incredible soundtrack, everything is perfectly integrated into what can only be described as an intelligent comedy.']
