From start to finish, I laughed a lot during the whole movie. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" is possibly the grandfather, though more ruthless, of all the comedic movies. This is the way I enjoy watching TV without getting bored on the channels, just to suffer insomnia! For 73 minutes, the strange and strange humor never stops! Just think how all this nonsense can help you enjoy life more easily! It's much better than Comedy Central or any prime time show! Do yourself a favor and destroy all those soft and limp romantic comedy movies in the trash can! Better yet, tell your box office manager that you want "The Groove Tube" to return to the big screen!
