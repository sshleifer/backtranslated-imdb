I went to a small preview of this film on July 19, not knowing more than the names of some of the actors and that it was a fantasy / adventure search of some kind. <br /> <br /> The plot is really nothing like what I've seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently or soon to hit theaters. Despite what first impressions may give, it's not corny, cheesy, sticky or ridiculous, and it's actually very entertaining and fun. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds a lot to the film, instead of just filling the silence as usually happens in movies or television. And although I could have known what was coming in the points, I still could not stop looking at the screen; As far as I know, not a single person left the theater during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this movie, and as brilliant as it is, I can not figure out why
