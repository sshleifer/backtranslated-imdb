Hi guys, <br /> <br /> I've been looking everywhere to find these two movies and I can not find them anywhere in my local area. (I am Australian). Could you help me and tell me where I can buy it? In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I have seen and they are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie when I was 5 years old and it still is when I'm a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie, except my younger sister, because I've seen her so many times that she's fed up with it. I love this movie and I can not wait until I can buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
