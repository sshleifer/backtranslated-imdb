This film captures the essence of growing up in a small city in the United States for a single girl. The realism and the subtle nuances, offered by the character of Ashley Judd, Ruby, for the plot, capture what can only be described as an environment faithful to reality in the territory of Florida. From the blow of a screen door, to the lack of work, the echoes of what life really is like in the "red-collar riviera" offer approximate choices for the young woman. Paradise did not come easy. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deception, and learns to be her own woman, with a force that flows from within. The winning smile of Ashley Judd and the infectious step radiate warmth and deserve respect and admiration. The careful rhythm of the character's development is similar to that of "Ulee's Gold" in 1997, starring Peter Fonda, and also directed by Victor Nunez.
