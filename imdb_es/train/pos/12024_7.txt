The good thing about this movie is that it is alone: ​​it is not necessary that you have seen the original. Unfortunately this is also its biggest drawback. It would have been nice to have included some of the original characters in the new story and to have seen how their lives had developed. Sinclair, as in the original, is excellent and gives the movie the best comedy moments while trying to deal with uncomfortable and embarrassing situations, but the cast is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth must be congratulated for his valiant attempt to move the character and create an original sequel, but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original.
