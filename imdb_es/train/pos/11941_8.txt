It's not the journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell of "His Girl Friday" or the witty detective William Powell and the brazen Myrna Loy of Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur detectives on Scoop. His decision is more postmodern than after the Depression, Allen's writings are full of ironic self-loathing and the simple anguish of New York. The shadows of the old genius rarely occur, as when he, like Sid, the great magician Splendini, responds to his background: "I was born in Hebrew persuasion, but when I grew up I became narcissism." Johansson, fresh from Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, becomes a relatively good, sometimes stupid, student of journalism, trapped in a murder mystery fitting for London: a serial killer. The plot is a review of his recent London-based thriller, Match Point, up to the sins of the upper class and the "accident" of the "American tragedy" / Place in the Sun. In fact, Allen is reviewing Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo to name just a couple of other examples. I do not care if he goes back to work; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the originals and, unfortunately, it is only a reflection of its younger greatness. <br /> <br /> Allen as a director and actor can not hide his love for the actress, as he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore brings a middle-aged comedy to an appropriate place in Allen's canon, not It's great but fun, sometimes brilliantly satirical: About the alleged high-class killer, Sid (Allen) jokes "I would be very surprised if he killed a person." This is Allen's vintage humor. While there are almost no brilliant literary allusions like in most of his film, he exploits Scoop with music by Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to let us know that Woodman has not lost his touch of class.
