I'm surprised at how much I love this movie even though I really do not like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the performance of the animals themselves is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> I've already seen this movie 72 times (I know, that sounds scary, but it's true!), and every time the final scenes catch me. I recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. In fact, it's my favorite movie of all time!
