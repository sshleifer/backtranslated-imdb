This is one of the films that improve every time you see them. It is full of so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in the later films of Sabu (I still have not seen "Unfortunate Monkey", but the others are so big) failure, chance and humanism play a great role. The cut and the assembly are inventive and artistic, without the film being an "artistic" image, but very entertaining. When compared to "Run, Lola, Run", you should bear in mind that "Dangan Ranna" was made some years before and was aired on German television since 1997 ... so it's more likely that it served as an inspiration for The Movie of Tom Tykwer, and not the other way around. Complementary to the other comments, I have to add that I really like the performance and the ending. This film is very funny in many ways, and manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.
