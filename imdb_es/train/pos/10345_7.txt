The only other revision of this movie as of this date really destroys the stars and the film itself. In general, I like to read the comments of the users to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie that I do not know much about. It is unfortunate when there are not many comments for a certain mosaic, because when there is only one revision and the film and the cast are discarded for no reason, you do not have an idea of ​​what to expect. I read the review before seeing this title and I do not know where all the poison of this film and the stars comes from. Douglas and Blondell were very talented and attractive people who used to deliver, even when the material was not the best. I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable. It is not one of the great classics of all time, but a fun and enjoyable fun, much more than you can expect in most newer movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
