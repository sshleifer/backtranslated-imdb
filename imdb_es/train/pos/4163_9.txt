I saw this when I was a child in the late eighties and I must say that Galaxy Express is one of those movies that remains in your imagination for a long time. If you've never understood the appeal of anime, discovering this movie can be your golden ticket to Otaku-town. <br /> <br /> The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The cellular animation, although somewhat traditional, has a vivid style that explosively portrays the great talent of Leiji Matsumoto for the design of characters and visual narration. <br /> <br /> This is one of those unique movies for children like Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz that completely transcends the status of "family entertainment" and presents itself as a classic of cinema in its own terms. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
