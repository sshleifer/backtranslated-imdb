WOW. One of the best movies I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Absolutely LOVED ME! Before the opening credits were completed, I was stuck to the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a science fiction thriller - And the edge of your Whodunnit seat. Amazing. <br /> <br /> I wish it would never end. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a disposable paper. Anyone could have played it. The lead actor, Jeremy Northram was the perfect geek boy. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me who loved war games, sneakers and Track Down. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
