I really liked that movie! I do not relate at all to all the other comments I have read about it. I was completely captivated through every second! <br /> <br /> I thought the story was exciting, the acting intense and the right direction. It would literally jump every time the phone rings near the end of the movie. Even though there was nothing "terrifying" in the story itself, I was completely nervous throughout the movie, and for the rest of the night. <br /> <br /> I discovered that there were so many perfect choices made ... the casting, the script, the little bits of humor peppered into it. There were many points where the movie could have gone for the cheap excitement, but it never did, and for me, it put this movie above many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately ... and for the last number of years .
