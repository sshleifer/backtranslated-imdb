Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of Poirot's best books, as it is very scary and has an ingenious ending. There is no doubt that the television adaptation is visually striking, with a charming photograph and very disturbing music. As always, David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot, the comic highlight of the episode is the battle of Poirot with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is as good as the rather naive Captain Hastings. The rest of the cast becomes a decent performance, but be careful not to overshadow the two clues, a danger in some adaptations of Christie. Some of the episodes were quite scary, a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs, an episode that I enjoyed much more than this one. What made it particularly spooky, leaving music aside was when Louise Leidner saw the ghostly face through the window. About the adaptation, he was quite faithful to the book, but I will say that there were three things that I did not like. The main problem was the rhythm, it is quite slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens. I did not like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. In the book, I see him as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of ​​turning him into a murderer, and of developing it little by little, made him a less attractive character, although I am glad they did not miss his addiction to drugs . (I also noticed that the writers omitted the fact that Ms. Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the next victim of the murderer). The other thing that was not so impressive was that I felt it could have been more effective if the adaptation had been in Amy Leatheran's point of view, as in the book, Amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation. In general, despite some wrong judgments on behalf of the writers, I liked the murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
