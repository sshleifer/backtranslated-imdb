Jimmy Cagney runs through your eyes constantly in this story of a theatrical producer who fights vigorously against upcoming "talking" movies. <br /> <br /> This story of love, deception, women and dance is presented in such a way. In this way, as a spectator, they never treat you in a dull moment. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done. The story never really got lost in this frantic pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here have become a little outdated, but that does not matter because when you look at this in a time frame of 1933 it's fabulous to see this next to many other movie movies that They were launched during that time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a show for sore eyes in this film, which never loses its composure as always. Worker producer of advances made for movie theaters as intros. In this way, he tries to prevent his ass from going out of business, he was a Broadway producer before starting this. Joan Blondell is fabulous as the careless love interest, Nan, which offers such an energetic performance that is so unusual for the films of that era, that it is great to see a woman who presents herself as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the movie was the huge productions at the end. These were magnificent in themselves, beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced, but they just did not seem to fit the story. The only link they have with the main story is that Cagney had to make 3 advances in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing throughout the film and that these sets could fit in a movie theater. In this way, the "Sitting in a backyard fence" was much more appropriate for the story. <br /> <br /> The productions at the end seemed to stop this story of frenetic pace and that was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then I realized that there were two others to come. These sequences also received a lot of laughs from the audience. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie with a sour ending. <br /> <br /> 9/10
