Wow, I can not believe I waited so long to see this movie. I just could not see it. The plot has nothing that interests me. I do not know anything about football. I'm one of those American fools who has no idea. I had never seen David Beckham before this movie. I chose to ignore the buzz that surrounds this movie the moment it was released in the United States. Enough about me. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of heaven to make movies. What a funny movie It is full of color and exuberance. I had a silly smile on my face throughout the whole movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and adorable, that you can not stop encouraging her. It is no wonder why the US television program E.R. He has snatched it. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. These people know how to have a good time. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was deciphering some of the British slang and dialogue through the accents. I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I did not miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the movie!) I'm sure audiences around the world also have trouble understanding the constantly changing lingo in American movies. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date movie. She has a great sporty plot like Rocky and a strong sense of feminism that empowers women. I saw him with my wife and a sixteen-year-old niece, and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.
