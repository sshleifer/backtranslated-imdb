['The arrival of White Men in the Arctic of Canada challenges the freedom of an intrepid hunter of ESKIMO. <br /><br /> WS Van Dyke, the peripatetic director of MGM, was responsible for this fascinating vision of Arctic life among the Inuit. Its production was filmed in the place from April of 1932 to November of 1933 (although some annoying effects of the rear-projection show that some of the shots took place in the study). Although it is considered a documentary at that time, we would probably call it a &quot;docudrama&quot;, since it is written with an intriguing plot and plot. <br /><br /> The film shows the daily life of the Eskimos, both in winter and summer, and in fact begins at the warmest time of the year with no snow or ice in sight. It shows the constant effort for food, and the viewer can observe the thrilling hunts of walruses, polar bears, whales and caribou. The native language is used everywhere, with the use of title cards; the only English is spoken by the fishermen and mountaineers found by the Eskimos. In fact, it is the arrival of White Men, both good and bad, and the change they make in Eskimo society, which is an important element in the narrative. <br /><br /> This Pre-Code film treats in a frankly refreshing way the moral code of the Eskimos, in particular with their practice of sharing the wife, who was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the entire film can be seen as a valuable look at a way of life that was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930s. <br /><br /> None of the actors receives screen credit, which is a shame, as there are some notable performances. The most important of these is that of Ray Wise, who plays the main role of Mala the Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was an Alaskan Native of Inuit descent and is absolutely splendid and perfectly credible in what was a very demanding part. As handsome as any Hollywood star, he would continue acting, using the name of Ray Mala, in a sporadic film career, often in small, unbilled roles. <br /><br /> The charming Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Mala&#39;s loyal second wife; The names of the fine actresses who play their other two wives are now dark. Director Woody Van Dyke stands in front of the cameras as a strict inspector of the Northwest Mounted Police. The two decent-heart Mounties that must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer and Edgar Dearing, both actors of film characters for a long time. The Danish author Peter Freuchen, on whose books the film was based, has a brief and vivid role of an evil sea captain who wobbles wooden feet that recklessly awakens Mala&#39;s icy wrath.']
