Paul Verhoeven (genius and master filmmaker) counterattacks with something less than perfect, but still funny in a "kind of dirty old man", Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the final act slasher disappoints. However, I am giving a recommendation to this film for its special effects of MIND BLOWING (perhaps the best so far) and two excellent performances by the protagonists. Verhoeven's moral questions are, of course, provocative, and although the movie went out a lot, this movie is rather mild for old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two main flaws: Josh Brolin (also known as monkey man walking) and All deal with the elevator. If there was an access ladder, why were they trapped in the laboratory? <br /> <br /> A funny horror movie for a Saturday night.
