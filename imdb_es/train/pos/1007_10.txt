['Ok, let&#39;s clarify this. I really do not like science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /><br /> Jack O&#39;Neil leads his SG-1 team through a Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the possibility to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like your usual science fiction series, but it&#39;s not! The plot is set today not in a distant millennium like many other science fiction series. That seems great. It gives you things, events and things you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets. They have some, of course, but thanks to O&#39;Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there are not many. <br /><br /> The series has a good mix of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy a lot of special effects, you will not find it here. They do not use many bad ones, but a limited amount of well-made special effects.']
