I gave him a 10, since everyone else seemed to like them and it would have been rude not to. The reason why I'm bothering you is to add a personal observation about Castle's work. <br /> <br /> I have seen "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (the version with the intelligent color sequence where everything except blood is black and white) several times and "The House On Haunted Hill" many times. <br /> <br /> I'm not even old enough to have seen them when Castle was up to his showman tricks, so I can Appreciate them on their own merit. And while most do it for the second time, clumsy, hammy, etc., I think they hurt him. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of "Homicide" is GENUINALLY shocking and works today, and the premise of "The Tingler", although silly, was very original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was a TRIUMPH. Having used that house of Frank Lloyd Wright as its exterior, the excellent Vincent Price and a solid cast, plus a good score and production values, when I first saw it on a gala evening in the late sixties, it produced a reaction from the public. I had not seen it before and I have not seen it since then. <br /> <br /> It was the part where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you have not seen the movie, stop reading NOW) and we are waiting. to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> WITHOUT ANY telegraph of what is coming, the camera slowly recedes, forcing the AUDIENCE to change its look to ... I am saying no more (my "spoiler" statement above only covers THIS movie). <br /> <br /> The point is, I think this stratagem was DELIBERATE, not accidental, and when it happened, the COMPLETE AUDIENCE INCREASED (including most of the Men!) The audience of TEN MINUTES took her at ease. <br /> <br /> Now THAT is a superior film. An extravagant showman that could have been, but "House" and the other two movies that I mentioned were GOOD MOVIES. It is possible that Castle was not a Hitchcock, but neither was Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> It's easy to focus on someone's quirks and forget to examine their TALENT. So I hope this documentary has recognized it. I'm looking forward to seeing it.
