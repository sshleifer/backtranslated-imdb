Based on a true story, this series is a gem within its kind. The slave who becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village. <br /> <br /> In the diamond mining city of Tijuco in Brazil, the diamond commander, appointed by the king of Portugal, is the highest authority. Having grown up in the relative safety of her home, the young and beautiful Xica da Silva finds her world threatened when she decides to sell her to a whorehouse in the city, refusing to acknowledge that a black slave girl could be her daughter. In a desperate attempt to save herself, Xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commander for the king, intending to use them to escape. However, the king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the next day, and when the booty disappears, the diamond commander is carried with chains, his family is dispossessed and thrown out on the street with only his clothes on. Martin, the diamond commander's son, swears revenge. Xica and the other slaves, however, are sold at auction, and Xica ends up at the home of the Sergeant Major, an old man who bought her only to quench his lust. To the city of Tijuco, however, comes the new commander of diamonds, the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes. Immediately surprised by the beauty of Xica, he manipulates the Sergeant Major to sell it to him. And so begins a love story, full of danger, intrigue and passion, between a willful noble and a cunning slave who rises to become a queen one day. <br /> <br /> The series is full of rich details of the time. beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. And it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute. Sometimes funny with a sarcastic and dark humor, full of suspense and unexpected twists. "Xica da Silva" is definitely a necessity. I would like to be able to buy the whole series on DVD.
