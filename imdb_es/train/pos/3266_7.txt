Another Downey must see! If you're an obsessed fan like me, you have to watch this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale graduate who realizes that the life he has just acquired is what he left 26 years ago. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a bored lawyer happily married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed on his first anniversary when he is hit by a car. It demands to return, only that this time in the body of Alex Finch. Enter Robert Downey Jr., much confusion and much laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is 15 years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is a reincarnation. . And if so, how often do you come across the same souls life after life. I do not know the answer. But I do know that you need to see this movie. It's a riot, and Downey looks SO GOOD in a tuxedo. This movie makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. It is simply recycled.
