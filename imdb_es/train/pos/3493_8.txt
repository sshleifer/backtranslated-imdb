['This movie is underestimated. I loved. He was really sweet and sincere. A family that struggles but does not become a dysfunctional family, so typical of today&#39;s movies. The film did not make it a problem that they have little money or are Dominican Republicans like Hollywood has. <br /><br /> Instead, the problem is that Victor is immature and needs to grow. He does it, slowly, by the end of the movie. He has a long way to go, but it was a sincere attempt to move forward. Her grandmother is very beautiful and the scene where the little boy vomits made me laugh longer. A truly sincere indie']
