I must admit that this is the kind of film I would normally avoid, but I basically rented it for the stars. I certainly did not regret it. In fact, as you can see, I rated it with five stars. This film is the perfect combination of acute direction and superior performance. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the gross crime of stealing their parents' jewelry. The crime goes horribly wrong, thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family. Through a series of flashbacks, we meet Charles Hanson and come to an understanding of the tense relationship between father and children. <br /> <br /> Younger brother, Hank is basically a mistake. He has always had problems keeping a job and goes more or less in the direction of the wind. Hank is insecure, cowardly and very under the influence of his older brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank "stuck in a T" and gives what is probably his best performance so far. It shows us a man who is basically of good heart but is so influenced by external forces that he can not perform any important task. <br /> <br /> Andy, on the surface, seems to be a successful businessman. but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and that he has been misusing his company to pay for his habit. It is Andy who invents the plan to steal the shop from his parents, and has the weak will of Hank to commit the act. Philip Seymour Hoffman, surely one of the best actors of our time, plays Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who, on the surface, is a charming businessman who liked his acquaintances, but a real ball of slime underneath. He is absolutely perfect for Andy's part or you could say that, through his superior acting skills, he made Andy the perfect part. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad or insensitive man, but he has a terrible relationship with his children because he never really understood what was necessary to foster a positive bond between his children and himself. He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish. He always made it clear that he preferred his younger son to his older son, which caused a big emotional break between him and Andy. As we get to know Charles and Andy, the idea that Andy forms a plan to steal from his father becomes less unbelievable. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I can not believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my own person. Father, and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself. Perhaps this may be one of the reasons why I enjoyed the film as much as the story of a distant and critical father, a more successful older brother and a less successful younger brother so close to home. Fortunately, my brother and I never reached the state of committing a crime against my parents; I suppose we were made of more serious and more moral things. <br /> <br /> This complex of personalities and actions has been organized by expert Director, Sidney Lumet. At eighty-three, he still has the skills to give the audience fascinating characters and hypnotic seat edge action. 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years before Before the devil knows that you have died, but he has not lost any of his magic touch by showing us characters that will be remembered for a long time. <br /> <br /> The events and characters in Before the devil knows that you have died are hard and unattractive, and this is definitely not a movie to feel good about. However, it is two hours of maximum entertainment that I highly recommend.
