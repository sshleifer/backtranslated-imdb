It's a good movie. Some will not agree with me, but if you know something about the Bible, you know what it is. I think everyone should see it !! I agree with a new updated version, like being nice, but the message is still correct. If you can see this movie. It is not a "scare the hell out of you" movie, it is true with the Bible. I believe that the U. N. will play an important role in the looming world government. The last days are aligned with the Bible. Look what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that has now come to light to protect children from being abducted. It is the size of a grain of rice. I feel that this is the main runner of the mark of the beast mentioned in the Bible. Without the brand you can not sell or buy, with this chip so small in the future you do not know how much information you can put into it.
