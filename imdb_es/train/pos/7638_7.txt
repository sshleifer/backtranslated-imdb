Larry Burrows has the distinct feeling that something is missing. Since losing a crucial baseball at the school that cost him the championship, he is convinced that his life would have been better if he had made that opportunity. Then, one night, your car breaks down again. Upon entering the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck, Larry meets Barman Mike, who without Larry's knowledge is about to change his life forever ....... <br /> <br /> The premise of alternative life in the cinema is not something new, it goes back to the likes of It's A Wonderful Life and shows no signs of diminishing with the fairly recent Sandler vehicle that was Click. It is a genre that has produced very varied results. In 1990, this production directed by James Belushi, rarely mentioned when the aforementioned topic arises, seems to have been largely forgotten. What a pity, since it oozes charm and is not short in the humor department. We know that we are reaching your final message, but it is a fun and enjoyable way to be led. The film also serves to warn what was an excellent comedy actor James Belushi. I mean that if your style of intelligent impersonation and exasperation is not your thing,? then you are likely to avoid this movie anyway. But for those engaged by people like Red Heat, K-9 and Caring for business, well, Mr. Destiny is right on his street. Along the ride are Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox. <br /> <br /> Mr. Destiny, pure escapist fun with a welcome message in your heart. 7/10
