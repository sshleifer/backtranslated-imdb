B Movie? Yes. DIY Yes. First movie Yes. But aesthetically A +. This movie definitely had a bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc. problems of etc. However, this movie has many positive things about it. First, the most annoying character dies first! Second, it's made to be a parody / classified horror movie B. The comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people try to take all the independent films and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is, a group of kids fresh out of high school made their first movie. For what it is, just that, it's really good.
