Any movie that shows that the federal PIGs (people in the government) are the crazy threats for power that they are in real life has much to recommend me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the supervision and editing of scripts, and even, sometimes, the address is flawed, so there will be people who will discredit the whole movie and ignore the good times. <br /> <br /> I saw the original way when I was new and I hated it, I despised it, I hated it. that. I thought it was a terrible and irrational piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Now, however, I do not remember why. <br /> <br /> I think the two should not be compared or connected. <br /> <br /> Consider them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> Rate them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> This "Vanishing Point" provides a meeting place, a banner for people who want to promote individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize that the threat to freedom can be and is the government, especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> "The Voice" wears a hat with the New Hampshire state motto: "Live free or die". There was a time when it would have been the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a movie to animate.
