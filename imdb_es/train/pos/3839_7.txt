Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) science fiction movies in Hollywood. But long before that, he was producing generic thrillers in his homeland. History is a basic feminine premise, nothing new or fascinating. Verhoeven believes that he can improve it by adding a series of dream sequences, which instead of defining our main character and their situation, are only used as a way to boost the predictable plot. The script was solid, the dialogue helped to cushion the effects of the bland history. What really made the movie at least good was a great performance. Jereone Krabbe was amazing as the "tortured artist", and the supporters were also very good. In addition, Jan De Bont's cinematography adds at least some life to the film, helping to make Verhoeven look at least as capable as a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
