What a surprisingly funny and original show. The cast that starts with the hysterical Julie Brown (The Homecoming Queen Got A Gun) is simply perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays a lesbian who is always arguing with her partner and her business partner (Asian restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN.) I laughed louder during this show than any other I've seen (including Newhart, one of my favorite shows of all time) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane, you'll love this series, one of the best moments of the program is that Cindy Williams plays herself, cleaners, Tammy finds a photo of Cindy Williams in her coat, the image is of Cindy Williams doing an unmistakable act with an upside-down bowling game, it's amazing to see an actress like Cindy Williams play in this way. Soap Opera as with many surprise twists during your short career, I can only hope that one day it will go on sale on a DVD with many special special features additional The funniest series I've seen in my life!
