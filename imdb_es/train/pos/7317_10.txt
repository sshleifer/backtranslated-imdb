This was a movie I had heard about all my life growing up, but I had never seen it until a few years ago. His reputation really did. I knew about Michael Myers, I had seen the mask, I saw advertisements of all the bad sequels that followed. But I grew up during the decade that Jason and Freddy had deadly control over the horror game, and I never thought much about the Halloween franchise. Wow, how did they cheat me with cheap tits? <br /> <br /> Halloween is a really scary movie. Now, by today's standards, it's not that graphic and visceral, but this movie offers all the other levels that most horror movies can not achieve today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is very scary, and the fact that he is located in a picturesque Midwestern city is a testament to his ability. The lighting effects are horrible, with "The Form" seemingly appearing and disappearing in the shadows at will. The simple but brutally effective musical score only increases the suspense. <br /> <br /> The performances of all the players are well done, with a specific nod to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is a good Laurie Strode because she is very nice and vulnerable. It is much more frightening when Michael Myers is harassing her because the director and the viewer have invested so much in her, we want her to survive and move away. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis as A Man on a Mission, and it works well. It adds a sense of urgency to the difficult situation in which the city finds itself because it knows what evil lurks in its streets. <br /> <br /> In general, not only Halloween is a great horror movie, but also a great movie. It works on many levels and attracts the audience and never ceases. This should be the standard viewing for anyone who wants to experience a truly terrifying movie. And for an even more frightening time, try to see it only with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think you see "The Shape" lurking in the shadows!
