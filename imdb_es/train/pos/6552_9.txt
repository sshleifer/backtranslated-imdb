In general, I do not like Emma Roberts very much, but after seeing Nancy Drew, that changed my way of thinking. The actors in the movies made everything exciting and fun. Most of the time, when you watch a mystery movie, you can resolve it before the middle of the show, but in this movie it's as if you were really there. The clues have to fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime. It still amazes me how he discovered it. The whole movie was really smart and the people who saw it with me also loved the movie. The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, they were so cute. I do not think there's another movie like this until the sequel comes out. I give it a nine because the popular girls do not really seem to have the right part, but they still make me laugh. It was a great movie and a great mystery. I definitely recommend looking at it.
