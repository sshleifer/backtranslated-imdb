The best Cheech & Chong movie so far! Of all Cheech and Chong, this is the best so far. I think I've seen them all at least twelve times, and I love them all. But this is definitely the best. Compared to the others, it covers many topics and gives you a lot of laughs. Some of the texts are still part of our language today, after 25 years. I hope that one day they can do another, because they are still great comedians. I heard they're writing a new script, so who knows ... I guess these guys are the only ones who managed to make decent movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever saw one of them ...
