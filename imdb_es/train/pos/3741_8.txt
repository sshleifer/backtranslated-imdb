War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971. Follows a group of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland, a precise portrait of Vietnam on American soil, before they are sent. It focuses on two men: Boaz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, make friends and deal with a squad leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a limit psychopath (Shea Wingham). br /> <br /> A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a handheld camera for most of the movie and uses digital video for combat scenes. It works very well: the film looks rough (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully conceals his Irish accent and adopts a rather convincing southern accent. His performance is simply excellent: he is an extremely talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not so good. He is tall, muscular, very handsome and very soft. However, the rest of the cast is just great. <br /> <br /> This movie was discarded for its study. It had no stars, a family history and was considered "just another war movie." He only played one week in Boston! It's worth seeing in a video or DVD. <br /> <br /> In addition, Farrell and Davis have a long nude scene.
