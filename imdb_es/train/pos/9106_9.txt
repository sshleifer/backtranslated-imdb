Since I saw it for the first time, "Piedras" is one of my favorites and one of the few photos I could see again and again. The great script describes the life of a group of women (all interconnected in some way) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar achieved a convincing film in his directorial debut and proved himself as an efficient acting director. <br /> <br /> Although not all performances are excellent. Of all the outstanding ladies, they range from the average (Najwa Nimri) to very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation must be addressed to the new arrival Monica Cervera, who convincingly plays the late daughter of Antonia San Juan. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as the nurse of the girl, and there are pleasant little turns of Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> "Piedras" is beautifully written and filmed, when I saw it, I was so excited that I could not stop thinking about it for days. I highly recommend it.
