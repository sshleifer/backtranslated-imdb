Che: The first part was a fascinating experiment, which not only told a very interesting story, but also tried to do something different with the genre "biopic". The second part is the excellent culmination of this experiment. <br /> <br /> This film offers all the same attributes from the first, from the extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) to the brilliant direction of Steven Soderbergh, without forgetting his intention to break with the conventional rules of the biopics What I admire about Soderbergh's experiments ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they are successful most of the time. <br /> <br /> The final message of this movie is perfect, and it includes everything we have. They told me about the life of Che Guervara. The only fault I found in Che: The second part is that some parts seemed a bit irrelevant. <br /> <br /> In summary, I give Che: the second part a very enthusiastic recommendation because, like the first, it is a brave and fascinating experience. Image that challenges the viewer and leaves us thinking.
