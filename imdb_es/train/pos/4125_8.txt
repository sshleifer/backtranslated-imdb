I loved watching '' Sea Hunt '' in the past, I was in grammar school and I came home doing my homework and by 4:30 I was ready to see '' Sea Hunt '' and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures . I loved ! He took you to a place that was not very accessible at that time, under the great blue sea. Before "Thunderball" or even before Cousteau became common, Mike Nelson aroused the imagination of children. I would be willing to bet that more than a few children developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences watching this show. Underwater photography also progressed, the fascination with exploration is easily stimulated through this spectacle. Look and enjoy !!!
