This is an interesting real story of Archie Gray Owl, who dreamed of being an Indian in his childhood when he was 17 years old. He was born in England and then moved to Canada, where he was identified by Indiains and writes collums in magazines. He wrote a book that caught the attention of millions of people that the book was his life. But in the end, he told his wife that he was not a true Indian and that she was fine with that and that he died at the age of 43 years two years after he returned to nature.
