Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes star in "The Divorce of Lady X", a 1938 comedy based on a play. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the London fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home. The next day, a friend of his, Lord Mere (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man in the same hotel, and he wants to divorce her. Believing that the woman is Oberon, Olivier panics. Oberon, who is single and granddaughter of a judge, pretends that she is the lady in question, Lady Mere, when it really is Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We have seen this plot or variations of it dozens of times. With this cast, it's a delight. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, that great team in Wuthering Heights? Pretty special Olivier is terribly handsome and does a great job with the comedy while portraying the tense and nervous lawyer. Oberon gives his paper the right light touch. She looks extremely young here, more full of face, with the eyebrows of Jean Harlow and a very different hairstyle for her. She wears beautiful street clothes, although her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and with a dress that is tested, with that hairstyle, she is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is a delight like the real Lady Mere. <br /> <br /> The color of this is a disaster, and as others have mentioned, I could really use a restoration. Definitely worth seeing.
