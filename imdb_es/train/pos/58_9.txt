I caught the end of this movie channel navigating through the cable movie channels, and I was so intrigued that I looked for the next screening. <br /> <br /> I really did not know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I left this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed. Also as an adult who attended high school in the 1980s, I had a better idea of ​​what our children have to face these days. <br /> <br /> The fact that you do not see the shots only adds to the coldness of the plot. Seeing children and adults alike struggle to understand and come to terms with pointless shootings was sometimes overwhelming. And I'll admit that I shed a few tears along. <br /> <br /> In general, not a movie I would look for in what, however, I'm glad I saw it.
