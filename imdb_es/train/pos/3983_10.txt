This deserving and deserving of its prestigious nomination to the award of Hollywood, is a small jewel entertaining, with much brightness and some delicious surprises. Incredibly fun scenes include a hilarious filming (and re-filming) of a World War I trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimistic non-com and the unfortunate McDoakes as a Boyer / Colman messenger. all under the bright eye of Ralph Sanford's deliciously irascible anguish; a lost McDoakes guided and re-guided by Jack Carson equally perplexed; assistant director Chandler rejoiced at an opportunity sent by McDoakes: "I'm going to be a director!" <br /> <br /> The comedian of Ace O'Hanlon has a double role, both playing McDoakes and himself playing McDoakes! Interestingly, Richard L. Bare, who plays in one or more entries in the series, has rejected that opportunity here. In real life, Bare is a six-foot young man from Rock Hudson, but here he masquerades as a veteran actor (more than 500 movies!), Jack Mower.
