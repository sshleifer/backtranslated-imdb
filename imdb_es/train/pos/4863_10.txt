When musicals were not shown to choreographers, we had wonderful movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was delighted to finally see this movie. It's not a mix of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Part of the American vaudeville humor, the slapstick not the witty joke, clash with Wodehouse's British sense of humor. But, in general, American-style jokes make American characters look real instead of cardboard caricatures. <br /> <br /> Some creative scenes for dance numbers, including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors, more than one for the lack of a Busby Berkley above the top dance number. They seem much more realistic, if you could ever imagine the people who start singing and dancing as realists. <br /> <br /> The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore do not hurt the movie, instead they allow for different character dynamics. to emerge. It is also good not to have a cracking wise, a strong love interest. Instead, we have a soft and stubborn love interest, much more in keeping with the young aristocrats of Wodehouses.
