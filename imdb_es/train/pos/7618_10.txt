Hello: <br /> <br /> I heard about the loss of a co-worker who had obvious differences of opinion about entertainment, he loved it. Well, I saw an episode or two in the first few seasons and I was bored, so I unplugged it. After some years I tripped lost; Bored with the current science fiction rate. Wow I was surprised. Can you say that gravity is fine, damn it? They attracted me. The rhythm and the scripts are very good, some of the flash forward / backs are like that with the calmer characters, but in general they are fine. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are definitely immature imbeciles, very spoiled and immature. Kate, one step above them, Juliet was much smarter than Kate. Mr. Eko is underestimated and at Charlie's level, if not more, very badly, they both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (back) is a genuine curiosity. In general, a large series with many layers: looking more. <br /> <br /> Regards
