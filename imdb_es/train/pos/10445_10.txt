First let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes. It seems that some people are less intelligent to recognize this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of displeasure that this harmless little film generates of some people. For me, like most people here, before Sunrise made a big chord with me, I was really dazed, moved, inspired by her. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one visualization. Create some of the most incredibly unforgettable feelings and emotions you can imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it. <br /> <br /> The film works as a communion of two fragile souls who are beginning to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how a conversation necessarily relates to the following or the meaning of the themes of Jesse and Celine's discussions, but rather to the small nuances, the perfectly articulated responses they elicit from each other. It captures an honest, romantic but fleeting human emotion that is beginning to flourish in the amazing sublime Viennese medium; he convinces us that his evanescent relationship could be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open for debate, but I never doubt that they will not see each other again. <br /> <br /> The easy comments from RockytheBear and the user below are desperate examples of doctrinaire dissidents who are not willing to accept and respect those who love this movie. <br /> <br /> See it and it can change your way of life.
