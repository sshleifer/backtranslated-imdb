Anne Brontes' epic novel, THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL, must be studied and read in schools, libraries and people's rooms. It's a fantastic story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism and ruined marriages and a mother struggles to keep her son away from her brutal husband. They are stories so similar to those of today that we see and hear and I think that people can learn a lot by reading this book. Based on the possible real experiences that the author had in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie, it's a great version of the book and really touching. I am sure that Anne herself would have liked the way it was produced. <br /> <br /> Excellent performance and excellent locations.
