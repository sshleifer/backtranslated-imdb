I can admit that the script is not very good and that it has slow parts, but all the critics of this movie must learn to have fun. In the first place, the performances are excellent (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) Michael Douglas shows that he still has it, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character like the cheating wife Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, plays the dynamic duo, both adding their incredible talent to the boat, and second, this movie is the funniest I've had in a Theodore years, it's simple and simple, if you want to go to the movies, and you have a lot of fun, see The Sentinel.
