['As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman delivers an effective film about the violent side of the man in DELIVERANCE, possibly a definitive horror movie of the seventies. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox represent four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before they represent themselves in what Reynolds calls &quot;a large lake and dead&quot;. <br /><br /> But the people of the local mountain have a tenuous and painfully obvious view of these &quot;city boys&quot; who pass through their forests. And the next day, continuing downstream, Beatty and Voight are attacked and sexually assaulted (the infamous &quot;SQUEAL!&quot; Sequence of the movie) by two vicious mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert &quot;Cowboy&quot; Coward). Thus, what began as nothing more than a joke through the Appalachians has become a nightmare in which our four protagonists see the thin line that exists between what we consider civilization and what we consider barbarism. <br /><br /> James Dickey adapted the script of his bestselling book, and the result is a commotion that is often moving and disturbing. Often known for his &quot;SQUEAL!&quot; and the sequences of &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot;, DELIVERANCE is also a very tough test, with the four main men in their roles, and McKinney and Coward forming two of the most fearsome villains of all time. A movie that must be seen for those willing to take risks.']
