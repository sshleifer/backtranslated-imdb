........... as I was when I saw this movie) I will never see this movie again, not because it's a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 years old when my English teacher decided to teach us; The reason for this is that we read an excerpt from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were TERRIFIED when the Woman in Black comes through the window and floats on Kidd's bed, although, just before there is something that also scared us, that was when Kidd found the toy soldier under his pillow, and he heard the voice of a child saying "It's for you". That scene still haunts me until today, almost 7 YEARS after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> If you get scared easily, AVOID THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!
