I've joined IMDb to let people know what a great movie this is! It is not often to find a movie that is moving and visually cinematic but humble. You have read the plot, so all I want to say is that you do not look at it because you want to see a murmur of cultural and religious identity babbling, because that is the typical mistake that people read, instead, you just appreciate and you realize that it is a father. and son on a journey that grows to get to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it before movie 4 arrives at it. This was one of the few films nominated for a BAFTA that is independent and foreign. The beauty of this is that it manages to attract anyone, even if you never see anything subtitled or just get used to the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you hooked. All I want is for it to be longer and see what happens.
