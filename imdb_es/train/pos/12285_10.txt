Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende murdered. In the surroundings of a large estate that emerges from the ruins, becoming a force for the abuse and exploitation of indignation, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at that moment would be the process that led to the greatest infamy of its history to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would be Augusto Pinochet (Stephen's similarities with it are inevitable: remember, as an example, that image of senator with the dark). glasses that wink at the general to start making the palace). <br /> <br /> Bille August attends an exceptional cast in Jeremy highlighting Irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson that life always takes us to almost force us to change. In Esteban the law of resonance is fully applied, with great wisdom, Solomon describes with these words: "The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." <br /> <br /> Unforgettable splint of Glenn Close, the stained sister of Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snow-covered brother. Meryl Streep is also brilliant, a woman whose name came to her like a Clara's glove. With telekinetic, cognitive and mediumistic powers, this hardened woman, loyal to her direct and conservative husband, is an indicator of the character and self-control we desire for ourselves and for all human beings. <br /> <br /> Each character is a portrait of virtuosity (like the dignified rebellious leader of Blanca Segundo Pedro, unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., the bastard son of the senator, who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. <br /> <br /> The movie moves the entrails, we recreate some data that should not be repeated, but absurdly still occur (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against everything, life is wonderful because There are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize only Bille August.
