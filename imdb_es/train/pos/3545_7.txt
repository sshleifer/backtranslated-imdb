Great splashy Broadway music movie. A Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal fucking games. The mistress of the blonde Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him IF he abandons the dice. He decides one last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who bets big, is in town. He bets Sky that he can not get missionary worker Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. This may sound like a strange summary of the plot, but so is the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a true mixed bag, there are some wonderful things here. The songs are all good and the dance is amazing. The real plug of the show is in the game of shit in the end. Also Brando is really good here, it may seem strange to think about him singing and dancing, but he does it. I have to admit that watching Brando big and bulky tear some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun! Sinatra is also pretty good and Blaine is wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend. Your song numbers and dances are highlights here. <br /> <br /> Now, for the bad parts, Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress, but she has a colorless role and can not do much with that. The film is too long at 150 minutes, the scenes between Brando and Simmons really drag and should have shortened. Also most of the characters speak in very precise English: contractions are never used. Maybe I'm trying to be funny out of the mouths of the gangsters, but I found it jarring and threw me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth catching the songs and the dances, but it is too extensive. It comes to you after a while. I give him a 7.
