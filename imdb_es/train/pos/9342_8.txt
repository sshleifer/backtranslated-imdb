A powerfully wonderful movie. Once you allow yourself to be involved with the story, you are held in a deadly predicament. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), is in a crisis of life when balancing his career with his family. He realizes that his former roommate at the university, Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), wants to play the base. Find that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the September 11 attack in the United States, is no longer in touch with reality ... and decides to involve his mind with his favorite music of the past and video games. Former roommates rekindle their friendship and strengthen their old bond. Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try to get Charlie out of his pain ... but it is Alan who manages to get his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's attorney / tutor. Also in the cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. Excellent soundtrack with artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I've never been a Sandler fan; but I found it outstanding in this role. In some of the scenes, I thought out loud ... why has he never approached him to play singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic?
