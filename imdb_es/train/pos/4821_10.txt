One of those beautifully intense movies that attracts us so intimately, ends too soon! From what they were looking at the screen like: "No, they did not!", Hahaha. Good performances around! The acting is wonderful with Emily Blunt simply outstanding! He knew that she would give a solid and convincing performance to capture the majesty, character and vulnerability of young Victoria throughout the film. In addition, the production is outstanding in all senses: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable moment in a remarkable moment in Britian's story told through a very personal and moving biography of the school-age princess until her reign as Queen, then she married Prince Albert, and ended with the birth of her first of nine children. He had a well-written script and an impeccable edition. Rupert Friend is the young Prince Albert, always so patient and compassionate, that he struggles to capture the young queen's attention, instead of securing his love, before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) becomes absorbed. Equally fascinating was the relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother, who was sometimes furious, as well as with her mother and King William (who also disliked her mother). The performance and the scenes were captivating, highly emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation that existed at that time and, in fact, to anyone who loves a true and convincing romantic story.
