['I guess every time I watch one of these old movies from the 80s, it makes me come back in a simpler moment, no matter how corny they may seem today. This movie is good. I remember seeing him as a little boy and thinking that it was the best movie in history. It has all the heroic characters that a young cowboy wants to be. Now, as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I really know what is happening. I found a strange thing. How many people can move to Houston and connect with Sissy, get married, move to a trailer, have a fight, cheat, have an uncle die and then get back together, all in the course of a month? Only in America.']
