Taking into account the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The Idea offers a multidimensional look to a community assigned to hoods and distributors. But the funny thing is that this is not the focus or the theme of the short film at all. But it is the undeclared assertion of independence of these issues that sticks the most. The genre is unique and not the typical expectation. It is almost this game that draws attention for the first time, so see it twice is essential. The film has an aesthetic quality that lends itself to the true art of cinema. <br /> <br /> And it is this true art that with an African voice is extremely rare. The film is not copied to reach its message, it innovates and provokes subtle stereotypes (not racial stereotypes but based on characters). From the perspective of the writers, the film is brilliant. It carries multiple messages that include very fast character development. It must be remembered that this movie lasts less than 10 minutes and manages to establish the character very quickly. The use of color texture and music is also praiseworthy. But considering the last project of Owen Alik Shahadah, 500 years later, music is to be expected. But from a thematic point of view, it seems that the idea is a deviation, but satire indirectly avoids a social problem: bright things!
