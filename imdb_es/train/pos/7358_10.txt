One of the most provocative films with excellent cinematography backed by Mc Clarens and an amazing quote "Do you believe in love in the first place?". <br /> <br /> In this image a trace of expressionism was evidenced. Catapulting impeccable integrity into movies. Gabby (AKA Joey) played by Eva Longoria loved the movie and the role she played so much that she could not even bother to mention it in her filmography. LOL. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film would have to be without a doubt, the heroic rescue by MC since it saved the child 'Handicapped' with speech impediment. What I can add is that he acted perfectly! The use of James Cahiil's sound effects is incomparable even today. The drug bust that he makes at the beginning of the film is a very realistic pain. When I saw this film for the first time, I was so attracted by the intense disrespect towards the Gang Inthused brothers of the Southside gang and the CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). This was by far one of the most encapsulated cracks that Cahill has committed to filming. <br /> <br /> Personally, this movie has a sentimental value for me and I will download it in the near future. That's if I can find it anywhere, LOL!
