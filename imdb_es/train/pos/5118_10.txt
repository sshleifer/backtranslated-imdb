******** Spoilers - Care ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm partial to Urban Cowboy. I love it and I've seen it countless times, and I usually discover something new with every view. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I like about this is that Urban Cowboy is about working class people, not rich people who live in Los Angeles or New York. Well, it's true, except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a small town in Texas that moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And this is when Travolta really played in good dramatic movies like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing bad / good guys in big budget movies. This is a really good movie: the mechanical bull riding contest and the two-step dance can be silly, but you have to enjoy it for what it is. <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with horny brilliance) - and shortly after, they are married and live in the trailer of their dreams. But their relationship becomes a real-life battle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a true cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But in modern times, the roles of men are not so clear. Where can Bud prove that he is a real man? You can do your dangerous day job and ride the mechanical bull at night, you can be an "urban cowboy". But Sissy wants to drive her pick-up truck, and she wants to ride the mechanical bull, too. So, where does this leave Bud? While Sissy affirms her independence, she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex-convict rodeo star and prison, a true bull rider, Wes (played wonderfully greasy by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened, and Bud and Sissy separate. <br /> <br /> Sissy lives in the hut with Wes, who abuses her. Emasculating even more, Bud becomes Pam's child toy, a rich girl whose dad is in the oil and all that implies. Sissy comes by the trailer to clean it, Pam does not do that kind of thing. She writes a letter of makeup to Bud, but the evil Pam breaks it and takes credit for Sissy's domestic chores. <br /> <br /> Bud's Uncle Bob dies tragically at work when lightning strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance at reconciliation, but they are too stubborn. Later, the bull riding mechanic competition is at Gilley's, and you know Bud will win. Pam realizes that Bud does not love her, but Sissy, he did it for her. Wes tries to steal Gilleys, but would not you know that the urban cowboy, Bud, saves the day and wins the woman he loves? <br /> <br /> Of course, you can ask yourself why Bud and Sissy would go. To Gilleys on every night and "live like pigs". Maybe that contributed to his bad marriage. Or why Bud did not stay with Pam? She was not that bad and she had money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had friends as stupid as Marshall and Jessie who always tried to separate them: Marshall tells Bud: "She (Sissy) rides that bull better than you!" But part of the fun of Urban Cowboy is making fun, and saying, Bonnie Raitt is not on stage!
