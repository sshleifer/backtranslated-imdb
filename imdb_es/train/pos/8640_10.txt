This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to represent the performance he gave in this movie. Duchovny was top notch, as were Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters embark on a panoramic tour of historic murder sites, in one of the coolest cars ever made, the Lincoln Continental model of the 1960s. Early Grace is a simpleton with a taste for toothbrushes dry and butchery. He likes that his women do not curse or smoke, and that they wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a couple of artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are tugs from the rural outskirts. Although the majority tone in the film is dark, there are many funny scenes. The writing, direction and acting are brilliant. If you like road movies, murder, humor and storytelling, watch this movie. Everyone delivers, and you'll want more when the credits pile up. One of my all time favorites. "Hey ... shave that dog and teach it to hunt!"
