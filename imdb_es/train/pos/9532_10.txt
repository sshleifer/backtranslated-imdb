I really liked this movie ... the time needed to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the excellent interpretations, the impressive lighting and the cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> It has a Combined intensity and lightness of touch will not work for anyone who wants the typical fast action movie. If we lived in Elizabethan times, I would say that this movie is a bit like a tragedy by Shakespeare. But since we do not do it, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The film is intelligent in the way in which relationships and problems are explored. Much of the story is shown instead of being told, which I think makes it more subtle and moving, and that also works well for a story based on a comic (or graphic novel). Sometimes I felt that I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story: there was a quality as realistic as dreamy in the narrative style. <br /> <br /> I often do not prefer movies to the books they were based on, but in this case I do. (Although I also enjoyed the book). I bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and a insightful comment. <br /> <br /> (I also took my cousin, who is a little younger than the guy in the movie, to see him after I first saw him, because he has problems at home and wanted to use this as a way to start a discussion about the problems of father and son with him - and the discussion.)
