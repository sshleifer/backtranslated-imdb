['The most successful comic movies generally depend on having villains that are bigger than life, ready to jump off the screen and strangle you with a smile or a demented line or two of dialogue. Tim Burton Batmans had it, like (in an even more grotesque way) Sin City. With Dick Tracy, producer / director / star Warren Beatty stacks the villains until it becomes part of the frame. As a boisterous tribute to the pictures of the gangsters of the 1930s, only this time it was for children instead of the darker Bonnie and Clyde. Dick Tracy is full of bright primary archetypes and colors, where criminals carry weapons and form on their faces to shape their personalities. Villains like the Stooge, Shoulders, Lips, The Eyebrow, Mumbles, Blank, Pruneface, Spud. Chester Gould gave names to his characters that fit his profiles, and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass. The movie is a continuation of visual gags that are taken seriously. <br /><br /> If, at that moment, movies like Batman and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (undervalued) were darker representations of reality within a comic book scheme, Dick Tracy is more &quot;old school&quot;. It&#39;s a story of cops and criminals, or rather a policeman, Detective Tracy when he tries to capture Big Boy (Al Pacino, in what is possibly his BIGGEST performance to date, and in a certain sense the one that makes sense to his grand style), but not so lucky. There is also a small child, simply called the Child (Charlie Korsmo, who somehow brings more sperm to this little child than he would have imagined), and Tracy&#39;s love interest in Tess. And then there&#39;s the &#39;dame&#39; nightclub (Madonna, which probably does not give any kind of great acting performance, but maybe that suits the role well, and she sings excellently when asked), she will not testify unless that Tracy admits the feelings he does not. I do not have it for her. Then there are the complicated deals with knocking down Tracy and a mysterious masked figure with a wrinkled voice. <br /><br /> Meanwhile, as if it were an imitation of a Howard Hawks movie in a splash of visual effects and larger explosions, Dick Tracy adds to the winking and winking comedy and his action as his syrup in a large stack of pancakes. It is wonderful to look at this world, which is created in a way that fascinates them that had been done today, it would simply be through the proxy of computers (ie, Sin City, which can be compared with Beatty&#39;s movie). They lead us through this world in big shots and then we get into the plot, or whatever it is in it, in large editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those small slanted panels in the old comics. I almost remember the Cotton Club during these sequences, since the history, the music, the details and some BIG shots and shots help a lot to reveal what needs to be said, which, in reality, is not more than it needs and there is a lots of catchy script dialogues (one of my favorites: &quot;the enemy of my enemy is ... my enemy&quot;, plus any of Pacino&#39;s references to other figures in quotation marks). <br /><br /> Reviewing this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater (and only remembering small fragments), Dick Tracy is a hard fantasy in the best degree. It&#39;s full of good cheer for the kids, and with a pretty good square stock without a bit of the more sinister intention of its cousin comic movies (ie, PG-13 fare), and for adults its central release made with Pain and a solid feeling for the subtle. Even Dustin Hoffman takes everything, and barely says an audible word!']
