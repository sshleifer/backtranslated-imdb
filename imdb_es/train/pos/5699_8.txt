['It began one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history. Members of the Summer of Love culture, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, were eventually ancient for love pearls and all-night parties and evolved back to everyday life, regardless of what that it will mean For those who could not overcome their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, the Wonderland culture was theirs. A love for drugs and a sense of right along with a dislike for authority, values and &quot;the establishment&quot; is the world that captures the film. <br /><br /> The sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore apart the American &quot;house&quot;. Once the battles ended, we all had to deal with the consequences of the carnage. The characters of the House of Wonderland are icons of the misfits of the seventies; Part motorist, part hippie, part thief, all marginalized. No ideology to express, only a feeling of dissatisfaction with everything and loyalty to nothing. Ron, Billy and David imagine themselves as a kind of Robin Hood with drugs. They talk about love and behave violently; They take from the rich and sell to the dispossessed. they steal from everyone <br /><br /> Holmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of antimatter like sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll, when laboratory technicians get bored and move on. <br /><br /> The film is skillfully directed and stimulated, and captures the frantic world of the drug demons in its element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. That story was told in &quot;Boogie Nights.&quot; This is a story of an era of transition and forgettable.']
