['I am a member of a canoeing club and I can tell you the truth that Deliverance is synonymous with the tranquility and tranquility of the experience. When we place our boats in the water, the banjo echo in the back of the conscious mind. This film is timeless because it accentuates the effect of place on nature and the effect of technology on man&#39;s relationship with nature. We see it in the bow fishing. We see it in the homemade tent. There is also the disdain and the feeling of superiority of the man of the city with respect to the &quot;cracker&quot; of rural lumberjack. The fact that the Atlanta banker (Ned Beatty) has &quot;bad teeth&quot; is meant to put him on the same level as lumberjacks who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle of life and death replaces the &quot;civilized&quot; assumptions about &quot;The Law&quot;. This canoe trip ends too soon for the spectator, but unfortunately it is not enough for the characters.']
