This is a strange movie, cerebral, surreal, esoteric. If there is a cinema of "intellectual horror", this movie is. I started to get scared and I wish someone else was watching with me, and he barely has a plot! I'm going to have to go back to this movie several times before I feel that I really understand it. If you are the type of person who likes "My Dinner With Andre" and the Godard movies, or if you consume many mind-altering drugs, you will probably enjoy this movie. Wow.
