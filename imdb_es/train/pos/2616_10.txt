The Lion King 1 1/2 is a beautiful story to accompany The Lion King. Basically follows the original story of The Lion King, but with a couple of turns. In the film, the windows are explained by a different point of view of the characters. This story is still an original storyline. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the aftermath, Disney is not so good as to make it worthwhile. This, being the third part of The Lion King (Simba's Pride is the second), actually has an original idea, while still involves the fun of the first. Timon and Pumbaa travel in search of the ideal place to live. After searching far and wide, they find the place of "Hakuna Matata". Then they meet a small lion named Simba, and they go through many things that the parents go through today. <br /> <br /> I think this is a very good movie, and I am happy to add it to my collection.
