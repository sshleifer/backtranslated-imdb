I do not know why some men from the USA UU., Georgia or even Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they do not understand at all. For those who did not see this movie, see it. Do not expect too much or do not put some frames simply because this is Kosturica. Watch the film without prejudice, try to understand all the humor inside: the people of Serbia YES married while Bil Clinton bombs their villages, the gypsies of all the Balkans ALWAYS try f * ck in everything they can, LOVE is always Unexpected, pure and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who say that this is a bad movie, I can only see that the shit from Americans (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) is much worse than a pure Balkan humorous love story like Promise me. The comment should be useful and, secondly, it should represent the writer's personal vision. I think the film is great and the people who see it must pay their respects to the director and the story told inside. It's simple, but true. It is brutal, but gentle and makes you laugh at the dead.
