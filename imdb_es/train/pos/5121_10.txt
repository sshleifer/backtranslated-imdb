I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think that Travolta and Winger had above average performance, I think the sets were representative of the location and the time, I liked the soundtrack and the Charlie Daniels band. However, I think the photography was amazing! Since the interior scenes were filmed at the Royal Club and Gilley's had low ceilings, perhaps 10 to 12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a "smoke-filled bar" that hung 2 to 4 feet below the ceiling . The camera managed to shoot through the smoke and concentrate on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dance, the low level of light that was actually in the bar! What a feat! Of course there was auxiliary lighting, but to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be shots with little light. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was exceptional! He got some shots that he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them gave the film a sense of reality. Thanks, Ray - Great job!
