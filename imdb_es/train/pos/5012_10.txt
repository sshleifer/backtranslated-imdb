In April 1965, CBS broadcast the first monumental television special of Barbra Streisand. The program was not only a qualifying success, it also won 5 Emmy awards. This is one of the most memorable moments of 1960's television and (unfortunately) the kind of special television that they no longer produce. Filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by Barbra, this special is a must for any fan of Streisand and anyone interested in early television.
