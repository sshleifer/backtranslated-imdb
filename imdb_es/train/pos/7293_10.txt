What do I say about an absolutely beautiful film? I saw this in Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon, considering that this is my main city. I am very fond of science fiction and I enjoy action movies. I was awake all night and was about to start the day when I noticed that this movie was playing in the morning. This is not a science fiction or action film of any kind. Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of Witchblade or Eric Etebari, after having seen some episodes (his performance in that seemed obsolete and robotic). But he really managed to win me in this performance. I really mean to win. Having seen Cellular, I did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was simply incredible. He was extremely convincing as the evil demon. But there was a detail so deep in this character that I was absolutely surprised. Later I searched online and discovered that Eric won the award for Best Actor, which is well deserved, considering that it is the best of his career and earned me the respect. Now I keep reading about the fx of this and the production of this project and let me say that I did not pay attention (sorry, Brian). They were very well done, but I was even more impressed by the story, which I think was even more his goal (watching movies like Godzilla with huge effects really discouraged me). I could not sleep after this movie, thinking it over and over again in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never easy. I showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her because of what she had experienced with the abuse. This is a film that I constantly think about and would recommend it a lot.
