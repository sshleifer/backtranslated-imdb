I loved this show. I saw it from the moment it first aired in the late 1990s until the last episode. In my honest opinion, it was a wonderful family drama that is so weird these days. Definitely a show that you could see with a friend or your children. Yes, things have changed a bit with Jo since the last time we saw her in the books, but she is still convincing with great stories and good lessons. The actress who plays Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does a wonderful job, as does the actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). Throughout the series, we can see the development of the romance between Jo and Nick, as well as the stories and daily lessons. Children and students learn. I recommend this show to anyone.
