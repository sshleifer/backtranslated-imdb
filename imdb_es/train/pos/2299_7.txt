Who said horror was not a genre of educational cinema, huh? Thanks to this wonderful short film by Hammer, now at least I know that I NEVER offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house, because I could be a hypnotist and this combination will give you the power to control my thoughts and mind forever! Thanks Hammer! The tenth episode of the House of Horror series is another one I've been waiting to see, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; One of the best British filmmakers, but sadly underestimated. Sharp was responsible for some very good films of Hammer, such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as some independent productions that were overlooked as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to House of Horror is easily one of the best of the series, with a complex but fascinating plot plot that revolves around charming hidden themes. The plot focuses on two antiquarians who run into a strange object that looks like a mirror, but in reality it is an old counting device that can be used to invoke Choronzhon; The demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is much desired by a satanic cult, as they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device. When he picks up a clearly petrified girl who flees the cult to avoid being sacrificed, Michael feels even more plunged into a hidden conspiracy. The satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical themes of British terror, but David Fischer's script is never boring and offers a lot of ordered twits of plot, among which is a very clever climax. There is also a lot of tension to admire, the dialogues are ingenious and the performances are splendid (especially John Carson, since the leader of the cult is really unsettling). Recommended!
