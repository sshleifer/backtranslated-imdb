Mary Poppins is definitely much better, but this is a lovely movie, nonetheless. Angela Lansbury is splendidly gifted as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson has a lot of fun as Mr. Brown. His chemistry was also brilliant. However, the children lacked the same brightness, although Paul is very funny and cute. The songs were not really as bad as some people say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact, all the songs are exceptional. The special effects were wonderful, they had a lot of magic and the story is quite original. However, the highlights, such as Mary Poppins, were the animated sequences. The sequence under the water was beautiful, but my favorite was the football game, which was absolutely hilarious. The only other criticism was that I did not achieve the end when I saw it for the first time. In short, a lovely movie, which is almost never set. 8/10 Bethany Cox
