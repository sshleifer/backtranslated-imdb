Of course, this film is cheerful and sweet and full of clich√©s, but it's entertaining, and for that I see movies. Be entertaining Natasha Henstridge is awesome, even with short hair. Her smile is radiant and her beauty can not be disguised. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure women love him. The two seemed to like them much more than in this movie. I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. I guess we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch, even if d'Abo's British accent was introduced in her supposed Bronx speech. To tell you the truth, I had not really noticed until I read these comments, but I went back to the DVD and now your dialogue seems more British than American, but it was ideal for your role with that one exception. <br /> <br /> It is the story of two nice people who are going to marry other important people, but who meet their twin souls. It may be an unlikely story, but who says that all movies are supposed to be played as documentaries? It is not more unreal than any of the dramas that are projected every hour on the tube. That is why we observe them, to escape the daily routine for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who tears easily. However, do not get me wrong, it has to be a sentimental scene, and this movie had many of them. <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10 just because I'm keeping my 10/10 for that However, a super magnificent invisible movie that I know will come some day. If you see it advertised as the movie channel or movies for life, or whatever, make a note to watch it. I think you'll like it.
