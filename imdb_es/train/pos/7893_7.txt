['I guess I&#39;m part of the silent minority that enjoyed this movie. Is it one of the best in the &quot;Nightmare&quot; series? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun with that. Freddy Krueger achieves his evil and terrible potential. Since parts 4 and 5 were delayed a bit in the series, I felt that the so-called final delivery (&quot;New Nightmare&quot; is the real ending) brought the series to its end. There are some great nightmare sequences, among them one in which Breckin Meyer plays a stoner that is shattered, falls asleep and gets caught in a video game that Freddy controls. This is a very original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see it outside the dream landscape, jumping like Super Mario. And Freddy prides himself on the graceful one-line, &quot;Great graphics.&quot; And since the film was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddy started to control the game with the Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove. <br /><br /> The cast is excellent. Lisa Zane is perfectly cast to the head. I have not seen Yaphet Kotto since &quot;The Running Man&quot;, and I think the last time I saw that movie was about 5 years ago. He is another unappreciated great actor who has a powerful presence on the screen. And who can forget the cameos? The best is that of Johnny Depp (the first &quot;Nightmare&quot;) playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial. <br /><br /> The 3D sequence at the end is really impressive! So for those who want to see this movie, please rent or buy on DVD! Hopefully all editions come with 3D glasses, but I&#39;m sure that the video editing has the 3D element removed. <br /><br /> Personally I did not see many things wrong with the movie. It was even elaborated on Freddy&#39;s background story. The film is a great mixture of humor and fear, and the excessive effects are spectacular. Could this have given better justice to the franchise? Of course I could have done it. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /><br /> And to finish, I loved the montage on the opening credits. The fans of the series will be delighted and will see it as a tribute to Freddy. <br /><br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)']
