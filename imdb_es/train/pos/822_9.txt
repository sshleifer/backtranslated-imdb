The last film of the saga of Lucas is a luxurious production and of spectacular aspect. It is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it is a category superior to episode IV (and only one category lower than episodes III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best movie in the 6-part saga. As far as I'm concerned, it's still a grandly entertaining movie. It is not a movie with beginning, climax and ending; The mechanism of the film works with a single objective in mind: close the universe of Lucas. There is an air of purpose attached to all this, which makes the film a bit sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it's very fun. New characters are introduced and old people face new and unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) a great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character to identify with. Again, it's the inner conflict of Luke (and Vader) that gives the saga its spine. The aggressive imagination of Lucas is still very evident, and the themes of loyalty, hope and redemption of the film resonate strongly. I'm glad that Lucas finally abandoned the idea of ​​doing episodes VII, VIII and IX, because this movie is an excellent alternative for a long, fascinating and captivating saga. It's not a perfect movie, but it's fun in the best matinee style.
