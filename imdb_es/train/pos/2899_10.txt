Very smart humor Excellent performance I can not believe how people could think that they deserve a 1/10! I hope this movie is shown everywhere so that everyone can enjoy it. If you ever have the opportunity, look at it ... do not miss it. There is a part in which the main actors lead and sing "Happy birthday" and "the clown". plinplin "(an Argentine song for children (I think ... it could also be South American, I'm not sure).) These two songs have the same tune ... but people usually do not realize that ... it's I just tried to write this in Spanish and English, because it's an Argentine movie ... but the page does not allow it :( I hope you enjoy it!
