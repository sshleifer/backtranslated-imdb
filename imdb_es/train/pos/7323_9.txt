The brutal and impassive Michael Myers stabs his sister at the age of six on Halloween night of 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is persecuted all the time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how evil this young man is. <br /> <br /> It opens with a bang and creates an atmospheric cooler and real suspense that is actually superior. to the many photos of slasher that it helped to inspire. It is subtle compared to the unpleasant bloodbaths that many of those later films were; subtle and terrifying It retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated visits. How many movies are there, really, that can still be terrifying even after having seen them before? Not many <br /> <br /> The pleasure is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her film debut, became a real screaming queen after acting on "Halloween", as well as some of the following images, and is a victim worth supporting. <br /> <br /> Co-Writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie, making excellent use of shadows and dark skies; Watch how most of the movie unfolds after dark. With this image, he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created a franchise that has generated seven sequels, many imitators and a forthcoming "reimagination". <br /> <br /> She is very valuable, who could forget Dr. Loomis's speech (Pleasence) in which she describes Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable repertoire in several of Carpenter's previous works) ? <br /> <br /> It's fantastic and it's worth looking for. This is my favorite John Carpenter movie of all time. <br /> <br /> It is not totally infallible. After all, there are script holes, but in general it has a solid impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
