I am a Jehovah's Witness and I also work in an intensive care medical center. Over the years I have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, I have attended numerous lectures on bloodborne pathogens and several patients have become seriously ill from pathogens induced by the transfused blood. I also heard from several Jehovah's Witnesses that they are told they will die if they reject blood and after 26 years in the field I have never seen this happen, leaving the question: "is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is it the community In Great benefit of the battle on this issue? The problem for Jehovah's Witnesses is moral. "You must abstain from blood" is not an ambiguous statement.Thanks for this film and for allowing comments on it.
