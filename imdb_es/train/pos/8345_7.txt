Recently I saw I.Q. and although I'm not a romantic comedy, I think it was a nice and sweet movie to watch. So many films in my opinion lack honesty. Do you know that feeling when you're watching a movie and you just feel stolen because it's taking something out of the story and it was as if the director gathered it as if it were garbage? The history among scientists is sweet and fun. How they stayed together and tried to help Tim Robbins to be smart. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and mentioned a good point when it comes to loving, "nothing is what it seems". I would recommend this for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
