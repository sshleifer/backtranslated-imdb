Dan, the widowed father of three girls, has his own column of advice that will probably be part of the syndication. After the death of his wife, he has taken time to raise his daughters. Not knowing the romance for quite some time, nothing prepares him for the meeting with the radiant Marie, in a local bookstore in a small town in Rhode Island in the ocean, where he went to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. After he liked Marie at first sight, little prepares him when the beautiful woman appears in the family complex. After all, she is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. <br /> <br /> From the beginning it is clear that Dan and Marie are made for each other, and although we perceive what the result will be, we go for The fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, author and screenwriter, has given us two excellent novels, "What's Eating Gilber Grapes" and "An Ocean in Iowa", and the delicious indie, "Pieces of April", which he also directed. It's just a coincidence that both films deal with families during Thanksgiving meetings. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. In fact, Mr. Carell. Keep improving all the time. In many ways, it reminds us of Jack Lemmon, in his version of comedy and serious material. What can be said about Binoche, an intelligent actress and a brilliant presence in any movie? He is up to doing comedy, convincing us of his Marie. <br /> <br /> The only sad note is the waste of talent in the image. John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, have nothing to do. They only serve as incidental music for decoration. Dane Cook, who is seen as a Brother Mitch, fares better because he recites more lines than the others. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a charming movie that will please everyone.
