Well, once again it's a movie that plays with your feelings and comes out soft instead of a rocky movie. But I'm an imbecile for that, so I gave him a good score ... the performance was very good and there were many feelings. Violence is kept to a minimum, which makes a change. I would have given him a 9 if it was not for the greeting at the end! In short, a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
