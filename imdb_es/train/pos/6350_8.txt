I waited and waited for this movie to come out, the trailers seemed to be on for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over again, but I can not wait for this to come out so everyone can buy! He was not a big fan of Jim, but this suited him very well, there was a lot to see and the "feel good factor" is out of scale, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did a fabulous job turning this into a movie. If you have not seen it, do it. If you have it, look at it again, I know what you want!
