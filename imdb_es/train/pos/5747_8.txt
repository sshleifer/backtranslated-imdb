If you have some kind of heart and compassion for people, this is a hard movie to watch, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> It is in this segment that we see that a nice little boy is beaten and then a retarded man (with mental problems) comes out of the depths after witnessing this brutal act against the child. It is not a pleasant material. <br /> <br /> However, it is a good movie and the acting is also good. The story will sit with you for a while. <br /> <br /> "Dominick" is a mentally disabled guy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this could be the best role of Hulce. He is served by a medical student, "Eugene", played by Ray Liotta, who became a star the following year with "Field Of Dreams" by Kevin Costner. <br /> <br /> Dominick is a good-hearted garbage man who reads "Hulk" comics and loves wrestling. He is the kind of "slow" guy you can not stop loving and encouraging to live a happy life. When you get scared, it's for several good reasons and ... well, watch the movie to see the whole story. It's worth your time, but be prepared to go on a real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset about some things you see.
