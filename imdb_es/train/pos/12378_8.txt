In the hands of a more skilled director, this film would have been considered a masterpiece of terror. Although Michael "Death Wish" is simply an acceptable direction, the film is interesting, original and more than a little frightening. <br /> <br /> The script breaks more than one horror clich√© on its back (several that can not be removed)) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine's boyfriend who actually listens to her while insisting that the creepy things are going down. Burgess Meredith is charming as the madly insane neighbor. Eva Gardner is stalking a young Beverly D'Angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover. John Carradine does a great job sitting in a chair. And beware of the brief cameo of an unknown Chris Walken! This movie is creepy and creative. The twists of the plot are charming, although a little predictable. The climax, of which I will not give details, is disturbing and quite impressive. Again, a better director could have done more with this, however, it is quite satisfactory, at least for those with the sensitivity of the horror of the seventies. <br /> <br /> If you like the fantasy of torture with superproduced modern superproduction of corpses, you won. I do not like this. There's almost no gore. The address is quite spartan. The effects are few, although there is a lovely makeup near the end, most of which is not really makeup ... but perhaps I have said too much. <br /> <br /> I rated this a little bit. The quality superior to its quality may justify it, but I enjoyed it as much as any "8" movie I've seen.
