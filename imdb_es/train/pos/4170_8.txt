I've seen this movie more than once. It was on par with many of the creepy things that were shown in the television movies back then. The only problem I had was with the title for obvious reasons ... One immediately thinks of Drake's famous sandwich cake! Leaving aside the first part, 'Hound of Hell' would have been enough. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna always manages to give a sense of seriousness to whatever he does, whether the plot is good or bad. But this was a nice Halloween rate offered by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna takes a flight to some dark country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast. He asks the taxi driver how to find this guy. Great dialogue between the native taxi driver and Crenna in terms of the taxi driver disguising the ethnic beliefs of his own people. 'Oh, Mr. Barry, I left that behind when I came down from the mountains ...' - referring to the mystique that rarely sees or advises people, and nobody knows how to really contact him. <br /> <br /> When it comes to supernatural food, this movie is still nice.
