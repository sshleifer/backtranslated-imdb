['Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) arrives unexpectedly at his son&#39;s house. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) has left her father. Ben&#39;s wife, Elizabeth (Elizabeth Perkins) and her three sisters try to find Muriel while Ben and his father go to see a farm that is for sale. But that is not the end of your trip. His road trip becomes a long session of therapy between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My Folks (2005). Paul Reiser is behind the script and he has done an extraordinary job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is simply incredible. And he worked with the script for twenty years, so I&#39;m not surprised it&#39;s so good. Who would be a better man to play the father than Peter Falk? Nobody, I can tell you. And I really love the story of why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the role. Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh. And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie. It&#39;s very funny when you go fishing. And how the old man hits the youngest in the pool game and then hits him with the stick. The movie is often very funny and I laughed several times. But it can also be moving from time to time. You could not tell a better story than what is told here.']
