First of all, I should start this comment by saying that I am a big fan of Nightmare on Elm Street. I think it's the best horror series in history. For me, Freddy is the boogey man! Of course, Freddy's Dead, which tried to be the last chapter at the time, is a rare movie. It does not have the same atmosphere as the previous films. Freddy has a lot of time on screen. Some think it makes it less scary, and I agree. And that is, in my opinion, exactly the point. This movie exists so that we can get to know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he was, how he became the man who stalked our dreams. For some people, it's a bad thing, it's better that we never know it because it makes us more afraid not to know why evil is evil. Obviously those people will not like the new Halloween version of Rob Zombie. To really enjoy this, you have to see things differently. It is not a strange type that hides in the mountain of your dream land waiting to scare you. This was the first, and it was amazing. As the years passed, Freddy killed more and more people, and no one could get rid of him forever. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's reign of terror. In addition to Freddy's past history, I also really liked the atmosphere of the movie. No more kids in Springwood, just crazy adults. The nightmare scenes are great. The soundtrack is impressive, especially the opening song called '' I'm Awake Now '' performed by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can not believe I'm so underestimated. Maybe it's misunderstood, or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should see it. It has many moments of fear and also funny moments, and many cameos! Prepare for something different and you will not be disappointed.
