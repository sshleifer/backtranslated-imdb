Poor Ivy: Despite the way he was born, he had the bad luck to marry a charming discarder (Richard Ney). Since the film is set in the 20s or 30s, when the rigid Victorian class ideas began to fade at the edges, this uncertain state bewilders her unduly. The Gretorexes (for what they are called) do not know where their next shilling will come from, but there are nautical parties and costume dances in elegant pleasures to tempt them. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) meets a wealthy older man (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born middle-aged), she assigns him one of his extravagant capers. Fortunately, one of the best people she still accompanies (Patric Knowles) is a doctor whose offices offer a stash of poison, with which she says goodbye to her husband. The fact that it involves Knowles does not affect her a bit, even as the hours pass until she has to hang around her neck until she dies. The turn of the plot depends on the police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the fearsome Lucile Watson); and Knowles' loyal housekeeper (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this melodrama well above average; The luminous face of Fontaine feeds the rest.
