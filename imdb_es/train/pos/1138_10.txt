When I was an 8 year old boy, I always watched movies and television that I should not, and this was one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it has to be the funniest movie I've ever seen, the acting is excellent, they do not do comedies like this these days (Movies that are REALLY fun and that make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of body fluid that induce vomiting as in those delayed Judd Apatow movies starred by non-protagonists like Seth Rogen, barf). <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic with actors who can act and deserve all the praise.
