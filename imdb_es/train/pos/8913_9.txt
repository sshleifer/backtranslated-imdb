This is my favorite classic. It was filmed a little west of Philadelphia, PA when it was 13 years old, in 1957, and it was released the following year. Then, in 1970, I found myself working in the same county as a rookie in the state of the Palestinian Authority. I've always liked to see the different places where the scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner restaurant well, and he had a traffic sign on the front that told all passing drivers that this was the "bubble house". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and movies are still showing today!
