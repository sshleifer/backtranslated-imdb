The first week of May, every year he recovers the memories of the holocaust, through movies on television sets. Among the many films they showed, this was the one I had not seen. <br /> <br /> The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. It begins with his childhood and ends with his position of greatest power in Germany. <br /> <br /> The film was previously presented as a television series and then turned into a film format. The Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with guts, conviction and flash to give a real image of this man. <br /> <br /> It is a good script and narrative, which educates the public about the main events that lead to Hitler. in power, and also tries to show the probable psychological composition of Hitler. The film is a skewed view of director Christian Duguay. Who shows Hitler as a one-way person, threatening, angry and screaming? that he had a strong control over the Germans and the people around him. Hitler is not shown as someone who has charism and attraction, and there the film fails to convince the interpretation of Hitler. <br /> <br /> Although the adventure was for television, all the ingredients of the production are first class and are on par. Mainstream movie. The value of production, sets, costumes, etc. They were perfect. <br /> <br /> There are many criticisms of this film, in the authenticity of the historical events that are presented. But still the film is exciting, increasingly attractive and entertaining. Robert Carlyle dominates and dominates the screen like no one else does. He is incredibly good? sparkly! I would have liked to have a more balanced view of Hitler's life, because I believe that Hitler was able to bring out the latent feelings of millions of Germans and not only should he be blamed for the holocaust. As I said several times, that ?? very sadly: our society loves garland or prosecute a person, as a representative of the good or evil of society, respectively.
