I bought the DVD of this version to compare with the current version of BBC 2005 (which is great). The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for television and died this year (2005). I remember a great performance, especially by Rigg and Elliott, and music on the move. (The music in the 2005 version is much more discreet, but very revealing). Just to catch other commentators on a couple of points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's boyfriend, not Esther's. Esther did not have an uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in any of the versions, nor played Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are honorable and admirable adaptations of Dickens' great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and sentimentality can make you shudder sometimes, but I challenge you not to cry, and laugh!
