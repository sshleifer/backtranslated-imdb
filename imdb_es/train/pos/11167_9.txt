One of my favorites, this film talks about two "characters" fiefs of New York, Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), who strive to be the "main boy" on Bowery in the late nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913), were real people, although this is a very fictional account of their antics (based on a play). The legendary Brodie (did he? - is still a matter of argument!), Jumping from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became famous, is shown here as happening more or less at the same time that the Spanish-American War (1898). Director Walsh clearly had a great affection for the period, so beautifully recreated here, and included a ragustious number of ragustious singer Trixie Odbray (a young Pert Kelton). Raft is at his best as Brodie, and Beery shows again what intelligent that he was the actor, so strong, of great heart and, at times, quite moving, to Connors. Bonito Fay Wray is the love interest that both boys pursue. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy, "The Bowery" moves at a rapid pace (unlike many early "talkies"). It's not an easy movie to find, but it's worth watching.
