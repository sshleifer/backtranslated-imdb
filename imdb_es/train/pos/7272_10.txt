Before starting, let me tell you how GREAT these special sounds sound when you play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut at the same time (Red Mountain level in particular). So while you see this special stand-up, I suggest ... no, DEMAND that you do so. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia takes his stand-up to the far end in San Francisco, California. There, he mocks everyone with absolutely no apology. <br /> <br /> I am grateful to God that Carlos did not do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over and over and over again. He does a tremendous job of mocking everyone and at the same time, be honest about it; I know a couple of times I said, after Carlos said a joke: "Damn, this man makes a good point!" And then the Game Over screen appeared on my TV because I forgot that I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) Then, yes, there is nothing to complain about this special stand-up. If you have TiVo or something, do yourself a favor and record this historical time.
