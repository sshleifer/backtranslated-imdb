This is a British comedy movie that can be seen again and again without getting tired. Peter Ustinov has never played a bad role and this is no exception, particularly with his wit dry but his master plan very smart. Karl Malden has always been a fan of mine since he starred in "Streets of San Francisco." However, I think that Maggie Smith is the true star of this film, who seems to be so inept with everything she tries to do, but in reality she is so turned on, particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered while washing his clothes. However, I worry about one thing. Could someone tell me why I can not buy this in DVD or VHS format in the UK? Could anyone help me?
