['The new short by David Lynch is a very &quot;Lynchian&quot; piece, full of darkness, tension, silence, discreet but very textured background music, and presents again two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, a recurring theme in their work. <br /><br /> Both characters create an intriguing relationship of slaves and mistresses that could be seen as a direct follow-up of the same kind of relationship that appears in Mulholland Dr. <br /><br /> Beautiful. For the Lynch fans. <br /><br />']
