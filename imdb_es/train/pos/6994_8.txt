Bela made 9 photos for Monogram, but it was only in ESTA, the 4th, when things started to come together. All the rest of the series would use this as an essential template for the production, writing and development of characters. From now on, better or worse, the series will also address an essential issue: a scientist (usually Bela) experiments in the basement or in the old house (sometimes IN the basement in the old house) that makes things put ugly. This was also the first time that Art Director Dave Milton had the opportunity to spread his wings. He came on board for BLACK DRAGONS, the previous movie, but THIS is where he can make his craft start clicking. Lewis created a great atmosphere for almost nothing and was present throughout the rest of the monograms. Casting is key in this, and it's a very good B movie, here. You get Barclay and Harlen (also BLACK DRAGONS), along with Russell, who would star in the films CAT PEOPLE of Lewton ... and Rosetto, SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a good part of the talent of Poverty Row. If you have limited time and budget, start with this ... summarize everything you have learned up to this point and offer something to compare the rest with. The plot? Bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young. They both like to sleep in coffins. If you can read that and smile, the rest will be easy.
