A rather unpleasant business that presents Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (with Renfield's assistant and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist's wife (sounds like a Greenaway movie in reality.) Lugosi gives his wife injections of dead girlfriends (why they? Who knows?) so that his wife can continue to look beautiful.He stays with the brides after doing a very clever trick with some orchids that make the brides collapse on the altar. After another girlfriend bites the dust, a reporter simply HAPPENS to be close to the scoop, and decides to snoop around a story, gets all kinds of clues about the orchids and Lugosi, the sky knows where the police were. Bela's lair, when she encounters a kind of strange-looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil, everything accumulates in a totally implausible plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist, but He says that the scientist has X-ray vision, because it frustrates his plans. Oh no! What will happen? In fact I liked This movie is a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is great here, his suspensions are very strange, the story is quite unpleasant in some places, which makes everything more visible. A little funny sight.
