['When &quot;Good Times&quot; premiered in 1974, it was one of the first black family comedies. He focused on the poor Evans family in Chicago and their struggles to come to an end. Most of the early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and on their struggle to support the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were fabulous actors and they had a great chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: JJ, Thelma and Michael. JJ was the skilful but well-intentioned teenage son who compensated for his lack of subtlety with artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive and bright girl who constantly exchanged insults with JJ. Michael was almost a child prodigy who was well educated on social issues and was destined to become a lawyer. <br /><br /> In 1976, the producers made a big mistake in firing John Amos, literally killing his character. This really changed the focus, and not for the good that I could add. The shows began to focus more on JJ and his buffoon behavior that infuriated black viewers, as well as the star of the series Esther Rolle, who left after next season. Instead of a program that focused on key African-American themes that existed in society at that time, viewers got overloaded programs of skunk chases and thick jokes. <br /><br /> Once Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show suffered even more. Although it could still be seen, it was no longer the great innovative show it once was. <br /><br /> Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it became clear that the program was in its final stages. All the loose ends were tied up during that season and the show silently vanished from the air. <br /><br /> First three seasons: A. Last three seasons: C +.']
