['Despite the feelings of most fans of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, in my opinion, &quot;Return Of The Jedi&quot; is the best film ever created. From the first time I saw it, its depth, intensity, special effects and a touching story have overwhelmed me. The film was so well done that it has withstood the test of time in the last 20 years. Filled with powerful action, like the climax of the original trilogy, George Lucas gives us an exciting ending to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga in &quot;Jedi.&quot; <br /><br /> Summary of the movie (contains spoilers for those who have not seen it) <br /><br /> After &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; left us hanging for 3 long years, we finally found the end of the story in &quot;Return Of The Jedi&quot;. Darth Vader, in an emotional turmoil, makes a surprise visit to a new Unfinished Death Star to supervise its construction. The Emperor is seen for the first time in this film, since he has the definitive plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and take the young Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie and the droids travel to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo frozen from the crime, the Lord; Jabba the Hutt. After Han has been rescued, and Jabba defeated, Luke returns to Dagobah to find a dying Yoda where he learns the terrible truth; Darth Vader is, in fact, his father. Rebel heroes regroup with the Rebel Fleet. Now, along with other species and races, including the Mon Calamari, the Rebels must make an all-or-nothing attack plan to destroy the Death Star before it is completed. While Lando is leading the space attack on the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star&#39;s shield generator in Endor&#39;s Moon Forest. This is where the rebels meet the hairy, but powerful Ewoks. During the intense two-part battle, a third battle must be conducted while Luke voluntarily surrenders to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side. In sequences full of emotions, Luke must confront his father while the Emperor attracts his dark emotions. When young Skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of Palpatine, Vader turns to his evil master to save his son&#39;s life. <br /><br /> Replete with an eternal and profound story of good versus evil, &quot;Return Of The Jedi&quot; is a spectacular and emotionally charged film that redeems the good of all of us.']
