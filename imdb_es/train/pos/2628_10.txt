I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels in history, as if it was not the best of the three Lion King movies. In the film, Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they come from and have trouble interacting with others, like Timon, who has trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa travel to find the place of their dreams and find it, and soon they find it, and also Simba, whom they raise, but soon they must choose between the place of their dreams or help Simba to face his evil uncle Scar and proclaim his right as the Lion King of Pride. Rock! Filled with wonderful new characters like Timon's Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was so funny and a comedian of Jney Stiller, Ben Stiller's father, expressed it. Disney was smart to choose Stiller in that role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, history and music, Lion King 1 1/2 is, in my opinion, the best of any sequel and better than Simba's Pride, although I must admit that I liked it too. Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel that the whole family can enjoy! It has a good story and it is very fun! 10 out of 10!
