Like the gentle gentiles that make up the second half of the title of this film, Michael Oblowitz's latest production is funny, but it's also slow and heavy. The last output of the producer, "Mosquitoman-3D" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but somehow they made it. The only attraction for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was his passable animatronix, which is always fun when it comes to wonderful worlds beneath the surface of the ocean. But even that was only passable. The lack of focus in some scenes made the production seem amateur. With dolphins and whales, technology is practically wasted. The cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the giant subjects in the film do nothing to take advantage of IMAX's impressive 3D capabilities. There are very few scenes of any depth or variety. The close-ups of these amazing creatures look flat and, often, there is only one creature in the field of cameras, so there is no depth contrast. Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you have Shark-Week on the wire, his introspective and boring treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
