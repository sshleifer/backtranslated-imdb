I'm surprised that we see a critic who criticizes this old movie. Normally we do not get good opera films, and here is a real great opera performance. Understandably, the images are not great. This dated But as an opera can not be criticized; and I'm an opera fan. I can not even detect a lip sync; If we did not know that Tebaldi was in the audio, nothing would convince me that it was not Sophia Loren. She does EVERYTHING in style! Your dark makeup is fine; and she brought the paper to the precious life! The rest of the cast is wonderful, as is that impressive ballet company. Most of the actors are excellent; Loren truly wonderful. His rival Amneris is also great. Who did not care about this 1953 work is shamefully negligent. Verdi would have enjoyed it! Naturally, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
