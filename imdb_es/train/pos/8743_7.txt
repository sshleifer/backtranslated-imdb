A good movie with strong performances (especially the two protagonists). The film is about two American girls who are caught with 6 kg heroin at an airport in Thailand. The two are in jail and one of them signs a confession. Bill Pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out. All they have to do is find a Nick Parks that puts the drugs in the bag of one of the two girls. So far, the story that is not so original (it has many similarities with the best Return to Paradise). <br /> <br /> The beautiful performance and the beautiful photography of Newton Thomas Sigel make it worthwhile to watch this movie. A 7 out of 10.
