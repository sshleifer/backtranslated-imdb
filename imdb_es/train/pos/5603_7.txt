['Here is the example of a movie that was not well received when it was made, but whose position seems to be increasing in time. &#39;The Tenant&#39; is a very interesting work by Polanski, one of the first of his European exile. It is set in Paris, and like many other exiles, the movies, the city, its streets, the Seine and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role. It is just that Polanski chooses his main character so that he is not an American (as in &#39;Frantic&#39;, for example) but a Pole, as he was himself when he went to the West. In fact, there are many personal comments in this film, made in what must have been a crisis moment in the life of the director, and the fact that he decided to play the lead role (and he does it with mastery) can also be seen as some kind of exorcism <br /><br /> In a way it is a circular story. The hero named Trelkovsky rents an apartment in the old Parisian building, inhabited by what seems to be first a well-stocked team of grumpy old people or just ridiculous neighbors. The previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out the window of the apartment, and Trelkovsky has just the moment to visit her in the hospital before she dies and is there with her young and beautiful friend Stella (an Isabelle Adjani with glasses in her first paper) . after &#39;L&#39;histoire d&#39;Adele H.&#39; of Truffaut). Soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are, it is a conspiracy to drive them crazy or to enter into life and the role of the dead girl. He fights, tries to run, enters the game and ends up entering the circle and slowly becomes her. The circle is closed. <br /><br /> It is not the most credible story we have seen or heard, but the strength of the film lies not in history, but in the details of psychology, in the slow degradation of the hero&#39;s mental state, in the game of permanent equilibrium. Between reality and deception. To a certain extent, it is not what happens on the screen that matters, but how it happens, recalling the classic &#39;Knife in the water&#39; made more than a decade before, at the end of Polanski&#39;s Polish period. There are many details that are never explained, but that is how mystery films should be and in reality that is the way of life sometimes. The feeling of claustrophobia slowly contaminates the viewer. Unfortunately, some of the graphic details in the last part of the film are not very well executed and the dialogues spoken in English (the film was done in English) almost neutralize the general atmosphere. However, waiting for the final scene of the punch is worth it. <br /><br /> It is not the best film that Polanski made, but it has many good parts, it shows the hand and style of the director, and it was an important step in the construction of his career.']
