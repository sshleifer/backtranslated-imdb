I really can not condemn the movie because it works. There are enough elements of black cinema to consider it a black film, but I think it is only in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing sinister about this piece, and that's where the noir elements fail. Of course, the disease could be considered sinister, but I find it hard to see that. The movie points to a darker side: Blackie may be trafficking human beings, the New Orleans police are too willing to arrest a reporter, the specter of the plague hangs over all the people in the movie ... but those are really only Suggestions. <br /> <br /> There has been no attempt to question Reed's motivations, such as one that has to do with Marlowe or Spade, nor is there any attempt to put Blackie's human side, which would make him even more derogatory if the trafficking of people really took place. <br /> <br /> The lack of depth is what the film fails at the end. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and the direction are well done ... but there is nothing to make this a film to which I must return again and again. It's worth seeing once, maybe twice if you do not remember it for years, and then save it.
