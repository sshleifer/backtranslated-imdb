['Monstervision was a show that I grew up with. From the overnight accommodation with Penn and Teller to the only one, Joe Bob Briggs. The show kept me awake on Friday nights in my high school years, and it gave me some of the best driving memories I have ever come up with. <br /><br /> Undoubtedly, the best television of the night. If you did not stay awake, you were losing. <br /><br /> I know that John Bloom and Joe Bob live, but I want them back where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... Did anyone else sit during the 4 hours of &quot;The Swarm&quot;? q :) <br /><br /> Long live Monstervision!']
