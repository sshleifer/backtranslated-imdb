['For anyone who has only seen the beautifully animated animated Disney Productions version of &#39;Beauty &amp; The Beast&#39;, or even the surrealist vision of Jean Cocteau&#39;s fairy tale, you will be surprised by this French version of 1975 (but with a Polish director ). The plot refers to a French family of fading aristocracy who is marrying in a well to make an English family. The main problem is that the boyfriend carries an ancient curse about the family. The film also includes many flashback (potentially) sequences that explain this familiar curse. From the opening credits, to the end, it is an almost non-stop erotic fun, with a VERY explicit and graphic sexual content (hence the X rating of the film in the US In its initial execution, which now is unqualified). The somewhat derogatory feeling of the film towards the ruling class will probably remind one of Bunuel&#39;s flights to a similar territory. If you have a taste for the truly strange and do not get offended by the &quot;taboo&quot; material, this movie may scratch your itch.']
