Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he has just done. Meanwhile, a chief of the CIA in New York describes the agency's response to what just happened on the screen. An American flag is proud in the center of his desk, in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, he becomes unfocused when his plan deviates into a morally dubious territory, as if he does not want to be associated with the course. The government decides that the action is necessary in the interest of national security. <br /> <br /> This photo effectively captures the mood of the film. In addition to portraying Bourne's quest to discover how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us for the sake of stability and security. <br /> <br /> It's also probably the best movie you'll see at the movies this year. <br /> <br /> It's so intense. Bourne tells Simon Ross (Considine) "This is not a newspaper story, this is real" and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera trembles, but it remains firm enough for you to see everything and feel that you are with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem to be the characters they are playing. , instead of being just actors who play well written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast and well choreographed that they seem instinctive rather than planned to the slightest movement; The doubles job is not less than incredible. <br /> <br /> The pace is simply incredible. Keep moving toward your conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to put together the plot; the script provides the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next action item in tense time. Although they are often simple (Waterloo's sequence is essentially just a man on a phone that is being watched by a man on a phone) they are charged with such dramatic intensity that you can not stop looking at them. The film is so focused on the forward advances that you can not stop it from dragging you. <br /> <br /> With its elements of intense action, a brilliant history and an intelligent examination of decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series captures precisely the ambiguities of our time. The ultimatum is its peak.
