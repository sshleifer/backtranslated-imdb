There are some spoilers in this comment !! <br /> <br /> Contrary to the comments I just read by nativetex4u and some others, I really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series. <Br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Judson Mills but I'm also a big fan of Chuck Norris and although I admit that some of the action scenes may have stretched the line a bit, the story fits in perfectly with other weekly series that Currently they are being broadcast. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes with Deke fleeing the bad guys after flying their missiles were full of action. I do not see how many "professionals" could not reach a moving target, but the action was definitely there and Deke, being the hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comment about the need to "get the film in the can to fill the space of time after the playoffs". This film was not originally scheduled by CBS for broadcast in January and filming was completed in May 2001, a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the United States. <br /> <br /> If the author of the comment had paid attention With respect to the film, instead of trying to avoid it, perhaps they would have realized the plot of the story: Rashid, a character similar to Bin Laden, He planned to launch a nuclear device in the United States. The president's man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer really MUST SEE the movie before trying to comment on it. <br /> <br />
