As the first of the television specials that are offered in the elaborate set of boxes, "Barbra Streisand: The Television Specials", released last November, this album will be released separately for those who do not want to disburse the money of the five specials . As an investment, this is the best of all, if only for the fact that it is Streisand in its purest state and most anxious to impress. That she has such a brilliant success is a key component of her legend. Signed into a long-term contract with CBS to produce hour-long variety shows, an almost-extinct format today, Streisand was 22 years old on this first special CBS broadcast in April 1965. At that point in his career His notoriety was limited to a handful of best-selling albums, some dazzling appearances on variety shows and talk shows, and his successful Broadway career in "Funny Girl." <br /> <br /> Shot in black and white, the program is divided into three different parts. With the transient creative use of "I'm Late" by Disney's "Alice in Wonderland," the first segment skillfully shows its growth from childhood through numbers as diverse as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five." With the opening of a comic monologue about Pearl from Istanbul, the second part moves to the elegant Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan, where she dresses elegantly dressed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing Depression-era songs like "I've Got Plenty of Nuthin '"and" The best things in life are free "with comical irony. Back to basics, the third segment is a direct concert that opens with a torch version of "When the Sun Comes Out", includes a mix of "Funny Girl" and ends with its classic and melancholic version of "Happy Days" Are Here "Again" on the final credits, it also includes the brief introduction that was recorded in 1986 when the special was first released on VHS For those who know Streisand just for their expensive concert tickets and fundraising politicians, this is a true revelation of why she is so revered now.
