This is an early film "Pilot" for the successful Canadian television program Trailer Park Boys. Executives were played on some networks before Showcase decided to hire them for a television series. A great performance and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy movies. The plot of the film is that these two small criminals are dedicated to "exterminate" people's pets for money. If you have a dog next door that barks all night, these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when they find a job too big for them and they end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the television series. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> R rated for swearing, violence and drug use. <br /> <br /> It's not too offensive either (they do not really show the killing of animals)
