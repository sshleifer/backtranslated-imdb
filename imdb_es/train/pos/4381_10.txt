This dramatic drama has it all: top-level acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both films take place in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think this is the best of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (she should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the lead role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil and despicable characters in the history of cinema (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another unpleasant character. I'm always surprised by the incredible variety of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-made man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if he violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that's basically what this story is about; The honor of the common man against the corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining, it should be attractive to everyone. It has romance, action, beautiful landscapes, and it has an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies.
