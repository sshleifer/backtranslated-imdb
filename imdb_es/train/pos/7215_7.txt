FULL OF SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> This is a rather quick and fun crime thriller based on Ira Levin's play about two homosexual playwrights (Caine and Reeve) plotting the murder of the wealthy wife (Cannon) to obtain the property and insurance. The plot is successful, but Christopher Reeve, when the youngest and least established of the two writers decides to make a play of the actual murder, with only minor changes in the details. Reeve allows Easthampton, Long Island, to become Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for example. The rest of the plot of the play is a raffle and to tell the truth, Reeve does not mind a gossip or even an investigation into the seemingly accidental death of Cannon. It will increase your income and your own Warhol quotient. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the playwright who makes megabucks, whose last four productions were bombed and who would not want anything more than to return to work in silence in a New play, perhaps with the contribution of Reeve , that would redeem his reputation. You can not allow Reeve's scandalous play-a-clef to occur. So what's new? - Try to kill him. In the end they end up killing each other, the manuscript is appropriated by her neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she earns a million dollars selling it to Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's very funny for a number of reasons. One is the production design. That multi-room, multi-storey house with the great windmill above, situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth (Easthampton!) Would be a splendid set of excavations anywhere. You could not afford a pup tent in Easthamptom. The house is not too big nor baroque in its decoration. It is magnificently modest, although it is a bit ordered for my taste, the kind of house that is so clean that you are afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the footprint. <br /> <br /> Next, the performance could hardly be improved. Caine, Cannon and Fred Jones are excellent. Dyan Cannon offers a perfect interpretation as the anxious wife whose pants are so tight they seem to have been sprayed, which is fine, given her assets. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable place in his role as an affable but murderous psychopath. Irene Worth, like the psychic neighbor Helga, was somehow difficult to define, a mistake. Of course she, or someone like her, was necessary for the conspiracy, but, my God, what offensive is your character, circling and saying, "It hurts me in zis woom!" I suppose to make it a little more interesting, she has gotten sweaty and with a ridiculous looking hat with bike reflectors on it. However, she is a nuisance from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> You have to love the wicked dialogue of Ira Levin. The anguished Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the play. "Because it's there, Sidney!" Reeve says, and Caine yells, "That's MOUNTAINS, not GAMES! The moves are not there until a hole *** WRITES!" It's also great Caine's call to the police after his wife fell dead in fear, as planned. He gets into a torrent of sobs, barely able to speak, as he reports the incident and implores an ambulance to be sent immediately. When he hangs up, his face assumes his usual placid expression, he puts his nose in his handkerchief and moves away, all over again. <br /> <br /> The climax, although it is ironic, is confusing, loud and complete. of artifice, devoid of the perverse charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the previous scenes. The score is composed mainly of cheerful riffs in the key, which fit perfectly to the film. <br /> <br /> You probably enjoy it.
