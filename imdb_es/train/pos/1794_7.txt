Halfway through the "night" of Lajos Koltai, a woman on her death bed asks a figure that appears in her hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life was?" The line could be shamefully theatrical, but the woman who speaks it is Vanessa Redgrave, offering it with absolute simplicity, and the question rips your heart out. <br /> <br /> Time and again, the film based on the new skirts of Susan Minot The sentimentality and the common, attracts attention, offers admirable performances and generates an emotional participation like few recent films. With only six months of the year, there are now two memorable, significant and valuable films in theaters, the other, of course, being "Away from Her" by Sara Polley. Hollywood could have turned "Evening" into a celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters: Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave in the movie (with a sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays the younger self of Streep, while the youthful incarnation of Redgrave is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson and a big cast, yes, it could have become a multi-star platform. In contrast, Koltai, the brilliant Hungarian director of photography of "Mephisto" and director of "Fateless", created a subtle ensemble work with a "continental feeling", the story that takes place in a Newport setting of high society, in the days leading up to a wedding full of problems. <br /> <br /> The lost connections, the wrong decisions and the obedient fulfillment of the social and family pressures present a great telenovela, but the quality of the writing, the direction of Koltai and the disinterested increase of the performance "Late "well above that level, in the rarefied air of the English, French (and some American) family sagas a century before their contemporary surroundings. <br /> <br /> Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle, are shown in a clear, understandable and captivating way. The individual melodies are intertwined in a symphony. <br /> <br /> And yet, with all the previous emphasis on the whole and the disinterested performances, the stars of "Evening" still shine through, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (a new and exciting Discovering, which she looks vaguely like her mother, but a very different actress), Danes carries most of the burden, until Streep appears in the final moments and, of course, steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are also worth the price of admission. <br /> <br /> As with "Away from Her", "Evening" stays with you for a long time, inviting you to rethink your story and your characters, and to Experiencing the emotions that it raises. At two o'clock, the movie goes on for a while, but the way he stays with you later is welcome among the many films that get cold before popcorn.
