They are only 2 episodes in a 5 part drama, but I can already say that this is one of the best things I've seen in my life. That is on television, the silver screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's so good that it's almost demoralizing! As a spectator, it's so entertaining that it bothers me that the episodes take more than fifteen days instead of Monday through Friday. It is clear that all these negative aspects are actually positive. <br /> <br /> I am a modern boy who had previously left the television dramas. Compared to movies, television dramas always seemed dated, fairly tame and, in general, boring! "Five Days" has really taken the television drama to the 21st century, so for me at least, it's a change of mentality. Go see it.
