A funny animated movie by Batman. Not on par with "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasm", but nonetheless, solid. I liked how the movie kept you guessing who Batwoman was. There was a good turn. Beautiful action sequences. I have always thought that Batman cartoons are better than any of the unfortunate sequels of the Batman live action movie. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
