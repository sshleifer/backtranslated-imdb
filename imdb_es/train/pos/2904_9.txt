This film is the second immersion of Damian Szifr√≥n in the movies after his excellent study of characters in "The Seabed". With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates extremely well-made characters, far from the prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. I have seen the talent of Szifron to present each character in a cheerful way but enough to get emotionally involved with them. Their control over them is magnificent, which restores a great direction in the film and a brilliantly polished script, the characters laugh and cry with a real feeling and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on the screen . <Br /> <br /> Spanish takes over English, the urban landscape of Buenos Aires at night replaces the Hollywood stages and the premise is as interesting as any other, so we have a film that dares to compete by the Hollywood machinery. <br /> <br /> But I want you to see the movie mainly because I have never dealt with such attractive characters, all of them. It seems that the script adapts perfectly to the actors and vice versa. I really believe that with a film like this, Argentina is really up to the competition.
