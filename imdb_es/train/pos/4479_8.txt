From the first time I saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, seeing it on a video tape makes me very nostalgic. At age 15, it was easy for me to get involved in the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now maybe I am more interested in thinking about the future careers of the main players. Although Sinatra had made a couple of insignificant movies shortly after his appearance after his days at Dorsey, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer pointed out, this seems to be almost a warm up for On the Town. It's possible that Sinatra had to put a lot of effort into it, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he would do better in his next pairings. However, observing his physique, it is easy to see why he was caricatured like a bean. Who would have guessed that within a decade he would win an Academy Award for acting, and he would play many roles as a tough detective or combat leader. Although the personality and dance of Gene Kelly dominated this film, her great performance did not suggest that she would become a great creative force, almost the iconic figure, for the MGM musicals, where she developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire Finally, it was strange to see Dean Stockwell with a new face and remember that he would later play an "emotion killer" in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder of the 1920s. An additional note: a critic praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. He later played opposite him on On the Town, but Pamela Britton appeared in this movie.
