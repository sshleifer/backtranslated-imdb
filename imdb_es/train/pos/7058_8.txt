Right after watching the movie, the true magical feeling of the Walt Disney movies came up and I realized that I had seen "real" magic in a movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> The combination of music, speeches and the right magical effects brings back the Disney feeling to your body. Very special things that I saw in the effects of not knowing in the movie, started with the Disney logo becoming Cinderella's castle and ended up like a fairy tale with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> The magic has returned in me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
