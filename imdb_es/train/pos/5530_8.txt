A must for anyone who loves photography. Impressive and impressive, it leaves you in the mineral. I saw it twice once in a movie theater and now on DVD. It stays well on DVD, but on the big screen this was something else. <br /> <br /> I took my two daughters to see this and they loved it, my oldest daughter cried at the end. But she was the one who wanted to see him again tonight when she saw him in the video store. its simple narration of a child's love for nature and, in particular, for a fox is told well. In a way, he reminded me of the bear when telling a story, not a documentary format. That works very well for children. not being preached is very important, you create your own opinion. <br /> <br /> But the stars of this film are the directors of photography, how they did what they did. incredible simply amazing
