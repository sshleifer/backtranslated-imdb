The old horror movies are interesting, many screams, many shouts and lots of humor to accompany them. "The Blob" is a classic in his own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager who tries to be a hero in his city. Going out on a date with your girl is typical of all teenagers. But when the old man discovers the same object that falls from the sky, he ends up being the victim, and Steve helps him as best he can. When it comes to adolescent power, this movie really provides it. I know that most teenagers have had their difficulties when they act, when danger arises, they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity. When adults in the city learned the hard way that "The Blob" was going crazy, they had to learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior overcome them. The monster that prayed was pretty nice in the day, and in my opinion, I think it was JELL-O! When everyone launches to stop the threat, the city is safe again, thanks to the usual cooperation. I still like Jello and I watch this movie all the time, if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! 5 STARS RATING
