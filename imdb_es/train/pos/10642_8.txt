['I just watched Detention last night and I liked what I saw. It was a great and funny movie. Dolph looked great on the bike. He also looked good in this movie compared to his other recent films. Now he is in very good shape. The story was good and the other actors were also passable. I would not call this movie its best version, but it&#39;s still a good movie. <br /><br /> But it also had its share of problems. The first was the way bullets flew everywhere and even when they fired at point-blank range, they did not reach the target. They should have shown people better escaping bullets. Another problem I had was the way the students swore. I do not know which school the students can swear to in front of their teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in number. There should be more bad guys. The last problem was definitely the fact that the whole seemed corny, but that was due to the small budget. In general, the movie was a good movie. Enjoy it. I would recommend that others see it. PS Now you are DEAD to the police. (Some One-liners were also great) <br /><br />']
