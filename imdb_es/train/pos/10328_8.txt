The creators have chosen the best people for the job and prepare the scene beautifully. Each interior is full of details that tell you everything about the people who live in it. Whether the period is the 20s (the first story), the present (that is, 1950) for the central story, or the 1910s (the last), the costumes and the environments are observed and created with love. I love the fussy disguises of the two old women in the sanatorium: an exquisite lace covered by the best shetland shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very attractive, but no matter the young lovers and addicts, it is Raymond Huntley, the man who suffers from the health and independence of his wife, which curbs our emotions. He usually played comic and pompous types, but here he is subtle, convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (the great movie of the 30s starring Gable and Harlow) stole the plot of the episode Mr Know All (and also stole a Kipling story). I wish we would see more Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband, although he has a good time with a melancholy look in a Mexican hat. I also love that elegant bird that plays with his wife.
