"They All Laughed" is one of those little movies that I always recommend to friends who are looking for something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the romantic traditions of the past, but it seems more contemporary. Even the atmosphere decidedly of the early 80's is not too extensive. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole company so light on its feet, that reality never makes it fall to earth. But, that being said, this kind of sweet little movie is absolutely based on the actors for it to continue, and "TAL" is blessed with a cast of dreams that understands the requirements of this kind of story. It is a film that would not stay so long in the memory if it were not for the small moments provided by the excellent cast: Colleen Camp simultaneously shouts orders to John Ritter and his dog; Blaine Novak untying all that hair from under his hat; and especially at the moment when Dorothy Stratten falls in love with John Ritter and says: "What ... weird". It is a piece of fluff that one does not want to put too much for fear of crushing it, but it certainly leaves one with a light heart and a smile on the face.
