The name says it all. I saw this movie with my dad when he left and after having served in Korea, he had a great admiration for the man. The disappointment of this movie is that it only focuses on a short period in the life of man; what is interesting is that all of man's life would have made such an epic biography that it is amazing to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters elude man's defective characteristics, which are cheap shots. The theme of the film "Duty, honor, country" are not just mere words uttered on the lips of a high command officer, it is the profound declaration of a man's total devotion to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck was the liberal who gave him a better understanding of man. He does a great job showing the daredevil general tempered with the human side of man.
