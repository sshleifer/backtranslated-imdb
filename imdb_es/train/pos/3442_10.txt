This movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story. I can not understand why people would destroy this movie either. <br /> <br /> If you're a Jerry Bruckheimer fanatic, this movie may not be right for you. <br /> <br /> This movie presents a high degree of realism. The performance of the actors and actresses is exemplary. It is not false, only natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound effects, special side effects. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is excellent, the music is very good. I can not wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> He leaves his body numb, like Constant Garderner. Direct talent has a natural talent, certainly not a follower.
