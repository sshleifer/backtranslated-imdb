The first and only time I saw the woman in black was the only time I knew that she appeared on television in 1989. It was Christmas Eve and my father and I were seeing him in the living room shortly before going to Midnight Service in the village church. I was quite young at the time, but I'm not sure who was more terrified as I walked through the churchyard to the entrance of the church that night, me or my father. <br /> <br /> There are many factors about this movie that makes it so creepy, but I think one of them is the fact that there is not much in the way of a soundtrack that plays in the background of almost all Hollywood movies, so every crunch, bang and bang are more amplified in your head as there is no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories does not involve jumping factors like things that bounce off the closet, so it's not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is happening. This is an intelligent medium, since nothing scares you more than your own mind stirred thinking about what is around the corner or behind the door. <br /> <br /> An excellent ghost story. I have never seen anything that can match it. With all the scum that is repeated over and over again on television, I can not believe that the BBC has eliminated it after (in my opinion) just one show!
