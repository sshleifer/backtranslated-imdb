['This is truly the best Swedish film of all time. Not only is it revolutionary in its narrative, but it is also one of the first films that presents the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindström are two of the most intelligent and ingenious filmmakers in Sweden today, and this film really shows it. <br /><br /> &quot;Vuxna människor&quot; (Adult People) is a cordial and hilarious story about adulthood, and the question of whether we would not be better without it.']
