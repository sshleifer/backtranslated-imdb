hi ... I think Just Cause is one of my favorite films of Sean Connery, it's a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances of the cast, especially Connery ... it also has one of the best lines I've seen in movies, so the dialogue is pretty good in this ... It also has one of the best movie scenes, when Sean interviews the character of Ed Harris in jail it's just fantastic ... I really enjoyed this and I can not recommend this enough, really not I miss this one! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews that indicate that the last 30 minutes stink, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, I really find Just Cause a very entertaining movie ...
