['There is no doubt that HG Wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century. Jules Verne has a certain right to be the father of science fiction, but his stories were more adventure stories that used wonderful inventions as plot devices. Wells was profound and brought subtext to his stories. Perhaps his greatest legacy is that there is little or no evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century, where, as now, many people, including Richard Dawkins, consider it almost a certainty. There is no evidence of this, of course, and one can not help but wonder if it was Wells who introduced this into human thought. Without a doubt it was Wells who sowed the seed. <br /><br /> THINGS TO COME was adapted by Wells himself from his own novel. However, it is quite obvious that he can not distinguish the difference between the technical aspects of writing novels and writing scripts. The dialogue is often loaded, hard-handed and unconvincing. An example of this is the two pilots of opposing sides who discuss the nature of the war &quot;Why should we kill each other? Why?&quot; This reflects the criticism, almost the contempt that Orwell had of Wells in his essay Wells, Hitler and the World State. and it is true that Wells&#39;s anti-war message is painfully exaggerated. It would be impossible to believe a conversation between an RAF pilot and his opposite number in the Luftwaffe a few years later. <br /><br /> That said, it is absolutely fascinating to see a 1935 film that predicts a world war that will take place in 1940 and that announces the end of civilization. When a child beats a drum while a ghost army marches the bottom and the collapse of society and the fear of Wanderng&#39;s disease, an amazing and disturbing image is perceived. Even the rather lazy account of showing the year of the stage has a convincing nature. It&#39;s the images that make this movie, along with the Arthur Bliss score, make the film so memorable. And to be fair, Wells asks the question &quot;The universe or nothing, what will it be?&quot; In summary this is a film whose failures are easy to forgive.']
