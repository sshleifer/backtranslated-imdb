A serious comedy. The film version produced by Ross Hunter of the French play "Les Joies de la famille" (later Americanized as "A Very Rich Woman") is luxurious, well launched, occasionally funny ... and unfortunately timeless. A wealthy California widow, who seems to be wasting her money, is harassed by her two greedy and adult daughters, who fear that Mama Rosie is carelessly spending her inheritance. The whole issue of a vital, but elderly woman, sent to a rest home against her will, and later having to prove that she is healthy at a court hearing, is sensitive material for a comedy (and for his credit, director David Lowell Rich does not overload the image with coarse gag or obvious feeling). Some of the humor is a little broad and it does not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the inherent gravity of this scenario and never touches a false note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's granddaughter, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has a lot to say about the importance of our elders and the ways in which they decide to spend the remaining time, that the seriousness of the theme of "Rosie!" It almost gets lost in the rush for a happy ending. The image leaves you smiling, and at the same time you wonder how many older ladies there were who were never so lucky. *** since ****
