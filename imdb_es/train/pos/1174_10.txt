Some people have stated that beginning in the 11th season, South Park has started a tendency to leave behind its politically biting satire for superficial parodies; but this could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> While this episode fakes the Living Dead series, there is more. It is a satire of how people treat the homeless. The characters say things like "They pretend to be like us" or "They want to be human". This episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class and who often have little luck. <br /> <br /> So, yes, it's still a satire and also a wonderful parody. What more could you want?
