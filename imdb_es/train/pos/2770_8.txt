['Seeing David and Bathsheba is a much better way to get your Bible lesson than going to Sunday school. Despite a script that is sometimes unintentionally funny, the movie is very entertaining. The study system had its flaws, but spared no expense when a luxurious production was requested. Peck plays King David as a lustful but tormented poet who commits what amounts to murdering the sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as the prophet Nathan offers his usual saturnine and fierce performance. Look for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hurray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.']
