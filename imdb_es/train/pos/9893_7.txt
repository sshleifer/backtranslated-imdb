The poor geek Marty (Simon Scuddamore) burned horribly due to a cruel trick of the Day of the Innocents, which went very wrong. Moving forward a decade and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known by horror fans for their turns in Maniac, Faceless and The Last Horror Film) in the joke, are ready for the next 10-year high school reunion, not knowing that a court with a mask of buffoons The murderer hides in school (now closed) and in search of revenge. <br /> <br /> Make this a guilty pleasure, I knew it's a bad movie. It has all the characteristics of one. However, there is something that makes me feel obliged to see it from time to time (preferably with beer in hand). I'm even willing to overlook the absolutely horrible ending (which, I have to say, I hate), I think I like it because it has a fun atmosphere and some very interesting deaths. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi and Donna Yeager get topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for the ladies): a photo of Simon Scuddamore's free cock start of the movie <br /> <Br /> My Grade: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate Extras DVD: Optional trivia track; trailer of this movie; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
