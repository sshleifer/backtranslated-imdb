I saw this movie without knowing what they were ... I'm a fan of Branagh, even more his Shakespeare films, and, at first, I saw her just for this ... and I ended up with tears in my eyes, for the great, great serenity, values, affection and brave philosophy of the life of the Helena girl. Recommended for people who are bored with TV programming (at least in Spain).
