One of the things about the movie that warmed the strings of my heart was that dry fly fishing was an important part of the scene. Occasionally I have practiced dry fly fishing, I have tied my own flies and, accompanied by my brother and my father, we spend a day in one or another river trying to tempt the ever elusive brown trout to get up and take the fly. that was offered <br /> <br /> When we had occasions like this, the differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world faded to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed by activity and activity. in the place where we were. <br /> <br /> This was one of the wonderful things that was presented to me in the movie when the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, carried out the ritual. Because there is something ritual in fly fishing, since there is something ritual in so many hobbies. You can not just start launching your fishing line and hope for the best. You have to tune in to the place where you are, you must scan the surface of the water taking into account how it flows and where the best point to place the fly may be and, depending on your skill level, you can even get your ground flies there enough for a fish to take notice of it and hit. The 'Art of fly fishing' was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists. <br /> <br /> The title of the film could not be chosen more accurately, since the river actually ran through the life of the father and two children. However, this film extends beyond the family and community in Montana, along the Blackfoot River, where the film is developed. It has the capacity to attract it, captivate it, capture it, as the history of the family, the community and the period unfolds. The story told is not just a family story, but a story of life. What can be classified as a 'river of life'
