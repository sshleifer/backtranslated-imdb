Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the script, Pickup on South Street is a hard, brutal and well-made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently acquires a top secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents . Also involved is Jean Peters as a rough tough guy who is used as a messenger by his evil former lover Richard Kiley. The best is the black cinema, and although the performances are very good, his great actress Thelma Ritter, who steals the film. Like Moe, a street vendor who sells ties (and who also sells information), he's stupendous in a role that brought him another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter has been nominated six times for an Academy Award and never won. This should have been the paper that fixed it for her!
