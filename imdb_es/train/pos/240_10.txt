Fantastic movie One to excite the 5 senses. It is not a true historical report and not all information should be taken as objective information. The real Hollywood conventions were used, such as playing a list and VERY attractive actors such as "heroes", such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook, Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne, right-hand man) of Ned). and the unattractive actors (sorry Geoffrey Rush) play Victorian Victory Police and drunk. This also instills a very unreliable love story in the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to attract all the romantics, the females are especially susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned prevents the fat young man from drowning and his father calls him "sunbeam" and had a "shine in his eyes when he looked at me, his hand on my shoulder", he is very romantic and persuades spectators next to Ned Kelly, the loser. Besides, do not all Australians love a helpless?
