['A TEMPLE OF SHIRLEY Short topic. <br /><br /> It can get very difficult at Buttermilk Pete&#39;s Cafe when the local WAR BABIES contingency arrives with diapers for their midday milk break. <br /><br /> This little primitive film, a parody of military movies, provides some giggles, but little else: the little crazy people who talk loudly can begin to fail in a short time. Shirley Temple, who plays a French duplicate who swings the hip, does not have much to do in this pre-celebrity performance. Highlights: the real signs of young children&#39;s temperament when some of the babies get unexpectedly well and really soaked in milk. <br /><br /> Nowadays, often overlooked or neglected, the short one and two reel themes were useful for the studios as important training camps for new or growing talent, both in front of and behind the camera. The dynamic to create a successful short track was completely different from that of a feature film, something like writing a short story first class instead of a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and schedules and able to portray a wide range of materials, the short subjects were the perfect complement for the feature films of the studios.']
