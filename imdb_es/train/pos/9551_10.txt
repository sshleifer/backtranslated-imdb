I must say that I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. Setting and acting is pretty good. The director also did a good job. Although some scenes seem a bit clumsy, in general it is a decent movie. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth was not revealed until the end. The atmosphere of the mental hospital was quite good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may find it a bit boring, since the storyline is very focused and they take their time to develop character and history. Moral of the story, it's a decent movie for its genre and it's surprisingly good.
