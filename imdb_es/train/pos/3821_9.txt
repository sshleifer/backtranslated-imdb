['Secret Sunshine (2007) is famous for its awards at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 and other film festivals. Jeon-Do Yeon, who played the newly widow Shin-ae, won the Best Actress Trophy at the 60th Cannes Film Festival. Secret Sunshine was also the winner of the best feature film and Jeon-Do Yeon received an award for best actress of the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. In addition, this film won the best film awards in virtually all Korean film festivals. Masterfully, written and directed, and photographed in a unique way, Secret Sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful due to the ongoing tragedy. This film also spoke about the forgiveness of God and people. Lee Chang Dong, director and writer of this film, said in an interview: &quot;In a broad sense, I wanted to express what love is and this film could be a melodrama in a certain sense, without love, we can not talk about hope.&quot; and salvation. &quot;Lee acknowledged that Secret Sunshine had no apparent gender This film is not a film about religion, but it attracted the attention of many Christians in Korea because there were many Christian elements in the film. <br /><br /> The turning point in Secret Sunshine comes when Jun, the son of Shin-ae, is kidnapped and killed. The kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land, she must be rich. His lie causes a lot of pain. <br /><br /> Shin-ae becomes a lover of the church and wants to forgive the killer. She decides to visit her son&#39;s murderer in prison and forgive him. Jong-chan, Shin-ae&#39;s friend, says: &quot;Just forgive in your heart, do you have to go to prison?&quot; The members of her church encourage her and say they will pray for her. Your pastor agrees with what she wants to do. That is a sad moment because it is too early for her to take an action. The result of the meeting with the killer is another turning point in Shin-ae&#39;s life. The murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by God. This kindles anger in her towards God. She says: &quot;How could you forgive the man before I forgive?&quot; <br /><br /> She begins to fight against God. She looks at the sky and proclaims: &quot;I will not lose you&quot;. She becomes a trap, her heart is a trap and her hands are chains. It is more bitter than death. She becomes more crazy and more crazy and is sent to a psychiatric hospital. The day that Shin-ae is discharged from the hospital, she goes to a beauty salon and sees a familiar face. The daughter of her son&#39;s killer works in the store and cuts her hair. The killer&#39;s daughter has helped kidnap Shin-ae&#39;s son. While cutting Shin-ae&#39;s hair, the protagonist can not understand what is happening and leaves the store quickly. <br /><br /> It&#39;s hard not to talk about Jong-chan in the movie. Jong-chan goes out of her way to be next to Shin-ae. Although Shin-ae does not care about him at all, he is by his side all the time. Shin-ae leaves the church quickly, but Jong-chan, who started attending church due to Shin-ae, stays there because he feels peace with God. Lee Chang-dong, the director of Secret Sunshine, says that Jong-chan is like Milyang (the secret sunlight), the rural city or vice versa. It seems that &quot;he is too secular and frivolous, but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her.&quot; Milyang is like him. Mr. Lee adds: &quot;Someone jokingly said that Jong-chan could be an angel, I think he could be the angel, who knows, we can not say for sure that there is no angel.&quot; If there is a person like Jong-chan who always accompanies the turns and turns of his lover, we can defend ourselves against the vanquished. Shin-ae&#39;s life is full of meaninglessness. Her husband died after he deceived her, and her only son was cruelly murdered by a murderer after she moved to her husband&#39;s hometown. And her soul was damaged because she learned Christianity in an incorrect way, and that makes her crazy, literally. It is too easy to say that your life is full of meaninglessness. Do you still have hope in your life? Can she find meaning in her life? The final scene gives us hope. Shin-ae tries to cut her hair by herself: we walk the path of our lives for ourselves. She, however, realizes that it is difficult to do it alone, and we know that we can not do everything by ourselves. We see Jong-chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair. That is your hope. She has Jong-chan by her side and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is in. As I mentioned earlier, Jong-chan is like an angel to her. If we feel that an angel is always next to us and behind us, we can find joy in life even if we face adversity in our lives. <br /><br /> Secret Sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in Korea. It&#39;s like the Da Vinci Code. While the Da Vinci Code helps us discuss the history of the early church, Secret Sunshine encourages us to deal with the mess of life and find meaning when life seems unbearable. With a superficial interpretation of the film, people misunderstand Christianity and its theology. With a deeper interpretation, this movie will help us see below the surface. Some people say they stopped attending church worship after seeing Secret Sunshine, and Lee Chang-dong responds by saying: &quot;They were already against Christ before watching this movie.&quot; Secret Sunshine is the story of a woman&#39;s life and We can interpret our life through the life of Shin-ae.']
