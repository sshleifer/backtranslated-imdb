Very good horror movie with Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa trying to find an ancient meteorite. After finding it, Rukh is poisoned by his radiation. Everything he touches dies and the dark side of Rukh makes him a selfish murderer. His friend, Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) finds a limited remedy to the problem and, at the same time, realizes that the radiation could be used for the good of humanity by curing diseases. The two demons will fight for the possibilities of radiation. Pretty good special effects. Others in the cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
