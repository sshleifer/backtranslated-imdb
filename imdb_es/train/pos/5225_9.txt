I think this movie is a very funny movie and one of the best movies of 'National Lampoon's', it also has a very catchy parody title, which basically summarizes what the whole movie is about ... Men In White !!!! The story is a parody of many movies, including a Will Smith movie, as you may have guessed, 'Men In Black'. I'm not going to reveal the ending, but it has a very good ending, it's very funny (Leslie Nielsen-like humor) from start to finish, especially the little close to the beginning when you're on the street picking up garbage cans (garbage cans) ). Also, they have a pretty good garbage truck (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The acting is not excellent, in reality, it's not very good, but that's what makes the movie fun, it's a comedy, relax! I love the story line, partly because it's very far-fetched and partly because it's interesting to see how subtle (or, if it's Un-subtle) all other films are cheated. I'm a big fan of fake movies that are not serious, but I'm also a fan of the real thing, and with these movies it's hard to decide which one is better, the movie that is mostly scammed (mentioned earlier in this review) or the real movie It is, but also when you are actually making a parody of comedy movies, it actually makes it even more difficult, but this movie is carried out successfully. The two garbage men are so funny that they remind me of a program of television sketches in the United Kingdom called "Little Britain". This movie is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, most entertaining, best story, National Lampoon movie to date.
