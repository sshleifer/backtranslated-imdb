I saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF. You can question some of the creator's decisions, such as choosing a fake document form for such a delicate and horrible subject, but this movie hits him in the stomach. Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch. I hope you receive the distribution you deserve.
