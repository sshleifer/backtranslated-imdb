It is rare, nowadays, to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the film (for example, Big Fat Greek wedding; Me, Myself & Irene). There were only a couple of unnecessary jokes in this movie, nothing unpleasantly profane. Around him, it was a nice movie with nice characters. I thought the end was a bit abrupt. It feels like they should have finished it in the world series for a true end to the explosion. The performance left a little to be desired, but was compensated by the pace of the story. If I had known it was a Farrelly brothers movie, I would have assumed that it was a piece of garbage that turned the stomach and I had not seen it, but it seems that even they are capable of making a good movie accidentally. Good for them, I hope they take their heads out of the way and start making good movies constantly.
