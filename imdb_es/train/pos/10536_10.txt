Yes ... I'm going 1-0 in this and here's why. In recent years, I've seen quite a lot of comedies and I've just gone with some slight laughter and a couple of video rentals for paying late fees because the movies were so easy to forget. Then I trip over "Nothing." It seemed interesting, although I did not expect much. I was wrong. This was probably one of the funniest movies I've had the chance to see. Dave and Andrew make a great couple of comedians and the humor was catchy enough to remember, but not too complex to the point of losing the joke. I do not want to comment on any of the real scenes, because I feel that this is a movie that is worth seeing for once. With more and more useless concepts in the movies (you know, like murderous military aircraft and "new" remakes that are ruining the old classics), this movie will make you happy to say that it's okay to laugh at "Nothing".
