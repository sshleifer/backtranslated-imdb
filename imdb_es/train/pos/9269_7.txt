I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now I know almost four times more (I doubt I learned a lot from Not Without My Daughter (1991)). <br /> <br /> Offside is an Iranian comedy of splendid budget on a group of girls (working individually) to attend a decisive football match for the place of their country in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to attend football matches, so the nation's armed forces have mobilized to save women who try to enter from within themselves. Some girls (teenagers?) Try to go to the party dressing as children, but are caught. The film takes place mainly in this waiting pen where girls are detained by soldiers, waiting for an unspecified punishment (although, the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was a badge to be executed). <br /> <br /> The film explores the absurdity of the situation. The idea that it excludes women from football matches is reduced to being too bold an experience for fairer sex, a philosophy not unknown in the West less than 100 years ago. This farce reaches a critical point when a girl needs to go to the bathroom, so a soldier who escorts her demands that she cover her eyes so she can not see the graffiti. The conflict has nothing to do with the battle of the sexes: at a given moment, a friction arises between a soldier who is rural and girls who are urban. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this film was not so culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost in this neighbor and cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You have to be in the mood for that, but no one should avoid this movie because they think they will not get it.
