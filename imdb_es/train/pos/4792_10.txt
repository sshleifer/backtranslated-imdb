The Straight Story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of America. On one level, a slow walk by the heart, they are friendly inhabitants and grain of amber, on another level it is about aging and remembering what is important (and actively forgetting what is not). David Lynch gives us time in this film and helps me remember that you can say a lot with silence. An extraordinary movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come.
