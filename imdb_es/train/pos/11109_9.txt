['The Sopranos stand out as a dynamic and hermetic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. By establishing history in the middle of the underworld, David Chase removes all barriers to a grunt, under the ground and the absolute deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /><br /> Each character represents a facet of American industry. Tony Soprano exemplifies the beleaguered rigid work, divided between family duty and the need to keep his &quot;business&quot; in a keel. The convergence of these two things is the imperative that makes history advance. The characters of Christopher, Paulie and Bobby reflect the loyal, but the selfish subordinates present in each company, which is trusted by necessity and not by merit. With the character of Ralph, Joe Pantoliano rehearses a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who springs from violence and is tragically overcome by his impressive power of profit. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the old-fashioned old guard, who maintains power through established relationships and the need for promising to deflect guilt. <br /><br /> Although abrasive and occasionally disturbing, The Sopranos has earned its place as the best television drama. <br /><br /> . A good complementary piece of the Chase series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest character interesting.']
