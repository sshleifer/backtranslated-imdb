Japanese cyberpunk movies have never helped me much, but of the few I've seen, most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The story is about a kind of parasite that seizes human hosts, takes control of their bodies, converts them into "necroborgs", and makes them fight with each other with the sole purpose of eat each other, apparently as a "game" for the enjoyment of such parasites. The film mainly revolves around a shy boy and girl who fall in love, but whose love relationship is interrupted by the two infected with the parasites and they are forced to fight each other. It becomes a test of the human will against the parasite's control over their physical bodies ... <br /> <br /> MEATBALL MACHINE will invariably be compared to TETSUO (as are most cyber-punk movies) , And for good reason . There are definitely some thematic parallels, although the films are definitely different. There's a lot of fun, spectacular moments at MEATBALL MACHINE, and creature / borg FX are definitely the high point, a mix of TETSUO-meet-GWAR that are elaborate and inventive. Depending on your taste for this type of movie, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing. If you like cyber-punk hyper-kinetic movies with a good dose of splashes, this is for you ... 7/10
