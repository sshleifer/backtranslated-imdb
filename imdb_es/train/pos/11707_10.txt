I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, back then, although it had no special effect, the performance was very good. And he still has the same message for today, even though the technology has changed, maybe they should make a new version of this movie, it would be interesting to see a new version. I also liked the music of the film, Larry Norman was a very good composer during that period, although now most Christian music is now music of praise and praise. I was always curious to know what happened to Patty after the series ended. Did he keep making more movies, got married and raised a family? I would like to have an update.
