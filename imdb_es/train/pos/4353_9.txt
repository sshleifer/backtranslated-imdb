How lucky we were to see this fantastic movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Upon entering the theater, they gave us a small opinion card that would be used for our personal rating of the film. Looking at the card, I turned to my wife and said, "How many movies in your life do you think you can describe as superb? Only about 5 for me." But then observing the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while watching the spectacular scenery on the stage of the movie in the state of New York, I slowly started uploading the film one category at a time. It was certainly good, but the all-natural repertoire of the actors and the award-winning performance of a man who, unfortunately, will probably be remembered by a detective wearing a detective instead of this movie, the movie jumped to an excellent level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my generally stoic and insensitive heart melted like Grinch's and I ended up giving him a magnificent one. <br /> <br /> This image is a must for those who have parents. No violence or naked but with strong language.
