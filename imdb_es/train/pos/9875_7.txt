Introducing Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a nice movie, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is great as always, but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and Van Heflin is developing too quickly. <br /> <br /> I mean, in a minute he's ready to beat him up. But the next minute he falls in love with her. I think this production, the editing of the film and the script (although the photography was great, the scenery was beautiful and the costumes were nice too) could have been a bit better. It feels as if the production is too hasty. <br /> <br /> The cast was also good, especially the little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter, Rosie. At age 11, she looks very cute and it's a shame she has not become a teenage comic actress. She is much better in this film than in her previous films such as Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except Broadway Musketeers 1938, she is very good at that), when they tried to turn her into a hybrid Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason. In general, this movie could be better, but in the end, Judy gave it her all.
