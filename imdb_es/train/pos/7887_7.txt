If you're a Freddy fan, then you might not like it. This seems to be a parody of the nightmare series. There is not much to see here. The only reason he supports himself is Freddy's background story. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is always good in Nightmare movies are the scenes of death. But the death scenes were very bad in this. The visual effects were excellent and the performance was good, but the background story was excellent. Basically, Freddy's story is completed in this circle. <br /> <br /> I have read negative reviews, but in fact I enjoyed it despite its many flaws: <br /> <br /> 1. A nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. A nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend it if you enjoy the series. This is where Freddy is fully explained, but that's all there is to it. Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
