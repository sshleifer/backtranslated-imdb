I've seen this movie three times. The last time, I kept skipping confusing scenes to find the resolution of the plot. Maybe the plot is not meant to hang logically. Or perhaps these rough points are in the frame because Ann's memory of distant events is quite defective. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who has attended an anonymous university with the concepts of a rich family. She must have had help to pay for this expensive education, but it seems she never has any family ties. It seems that he never has any relatives he can turn to when the consequences of one of his disastrous decisions take effect. <br /> <br /> Ann shares a night of passion with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, when Harris consoles Lila after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Ann suddenly finds him repulsive and disgusted with his own behavior. I must have lost something significant here. Ann's behavior seems totally inexplicable. Ann abandons her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the couple at Lila's wedding. Despite the rejection of Ann de Harris, she continues to feel deep feelings for him on his deathbed. <br /> <br /> It was obvious from his behavior that Harris was deeply in love with Ann and would have married her with pleasure. A scene that shows their casual encounter years after Lila's wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The movie showed a pattern for Ann's romantic relationships. She always had a fight with her men and rejected them. This pattern was maintained with Harris and two husbands. In contrast, Lila married a man she did not love and stayed with her husband until he died. Maybe Lila could establish a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail. <br /> <br /> Then came the overly convenient reappearance of Lila Ross next to Ann's bed. Apparently, Ann's nurse was able to extract enough information from Ann's last lucid moments to identify and contact Lila. None of these communications appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> I was wondering about the house Ann lived in during her last days. How could he afford to buy such a house with the meager earnings of his career as a singer? Ann always seemed to be one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I enjoyed the stage and music of the film immensely. The mansion by the sea was incredibly beautiful. Claire Danes was luminous like the young Ann Grant. She is really a very talented singer. I much prefer his natural brunette to the blonde bottle he had in the extras of the film. If only those annoying CGI fireflies were to disappear, I could raise the film a whole point in my vote!
