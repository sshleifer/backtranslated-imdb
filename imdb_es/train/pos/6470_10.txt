This is one of the great shorts of all time of "Our Gang". Spanky is in its funniest and cutest way, and the babies you have left to take care of are also hilarious. Tiny Spanky is forced by the gang to watch all his little brothers. The opening photo of all of them in baby carriages, which is entertained with various things hanging by the gang of fishing rods, is a beautiful gag. <br /> <br /> Spanky's appearance with his huge toy knife when the elders asked him to take care of the children. It is priceless, as is his response: "Hey, where do you get that? I do not care for any babies!" The little fellow who says "extraordinary" throughout the film, all the beautiful visual gags and Spanky telling the babies "all about Tarzan" add up to make this one of the best "Our Gang" you've ever seen.
