Most people (36) gave this movie a 10 and those who do not are too critical or maybe expect something more. This is one of my favorite movies of the 80s, it grows in you and it has everything. I just got it on DVD and 20 years later it still does not disappoint me, having a lot of action, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to that the big car chases, the automatic gun shots and a lot of things exploding and you have a fun experience on the edge of your seat! He will even be humming or whistling the main theme for days after seeing this. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / girlfriend and you will both enjoy it very much. The premise is that of a paperback hero, like Doc Wild, really existing and helping people fight evil so that he can write the story, it is almost true in this life. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also a director, producer and writer of many films. In THIS movie, Jake Speed ​​(the character) is a type of Indiana Jones adventurer, he usually uses his head to get out of complicated situations, but sometimes he resorts to raw firepower (yay, and pure luck too! ). Look out for your only high-tech "James Bond" team, the all-terrain off-road warrior of the road that falls from the sky. <br /> <br /> Heroin is the beautiful and young love interest of the first vampire Jim Carey. The movie "Once Bitten" and here is a little older and still a playoff even compared to his little blonde teen sister. <br /> <br /> Bad guys are "really bad" men and they are the worst villainous scum of low life. love to hate The ending is just perfect and can be independent or invite a sequel, unfortunately was never done, but you can imagine what will happen next! <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie just because it will entertain you and have fun. And that's worth the price of a ticket.
