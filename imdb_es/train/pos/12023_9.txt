A change of perspective is necessary to enjoy modern British films, one that somehow allows them to see them in their own right and their own qualities rather than the criteria with which American films are judged. Britfilm has to work hard to be brave and find it difficult to do so, but with warmth British films can dominate their overwhelming competitor. <br /> <br /> This film does not fail in its content, but only in joining. to the predecorator, allowing everything to be easily seen as the work of the star and the director somewhere near the end of their bonds. It's a couple of decades later, Gregory teaching and this time with two girls in his mind. He teaches at his school against human rights violations. When the students he has shot find abuse between them, they must face if it's just a talk. <br /> <br /> This is a subversive film in which there is no mundane character in any American movie that is expected to do anything. He does it, but a man naive man who can still put everything in line with principles. Perhaps. It is certainly not a protest by numbers, being too warm. Where the US film may seem realistic because it is urban and rough, this and other British films of recent years, those that do not try to equate the United States with visceral emotions, are real because British humor reveals truths.
