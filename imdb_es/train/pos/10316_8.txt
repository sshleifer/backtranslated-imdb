Remember these two stories with love and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a child preparing for the day of the exam, the state test i.q. The child is a little confused about the anxiety of their parents, since some of their friends have already done so and finally they will be tested. Upon arrival, he receives an injection and is curious to know why. The examiner smiles and tells him it's just to make sure he tells the truth. The child asks, bewildered again, why would not he? It is later and the parents are sitting waiting worried about the screen when a message appears and declares that the state regrets it, but the level i.q of his son has exceeded the national coefficient and asks politely if they want a private funeral. A courier of a conclusive scene! A Message of Charity was a moving story about a fortuitous mental connection between a girl from the past and a boy from the present. It explores a strange history of accusations of witchcraft in the past and delves into the pages of history in the present. A beautiful story with a touching conclusion.
