Nine out of ten may seem like high marks for a sci-fi movie directly on video that has been vilified at the US box office. UU And criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell's career. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First, when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the Soldier of the same name. I'm also going to start here, with my amazing claim that this is possibly the best part of the performance I've seen Russell do. Todd is an emotional cripple and has an intense post-traumatic stress disorder: this movie, written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now. <br /> <br /> The portrait is perfect. Todd is retired, uncommunicative and lonely. He suffers from irrational anxiety, due to an attack of fever that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being in search of signs of betrayal and danger. His hypercontrol brings with it an inability to understand the larger continuum than the tasks he has to perform: there is a scene in which he cuts himself cutting carrots and continues to work without flinching, without cleaning the cut or blood. Many interpret this as a sign of their physical endurance and focus on the work at hand, but it is also a sign that they are simply performing the requested task remotely, without understanding the relationship between the vegetables they prepare and the food. that will be prepared. eaten later <br /> <br /> Todd's dialogue is spartan to say the least: the two great conversational scenes he gets are fundamental to the plot of the film and both underscore the somber nature of his existence. Fear and discipline are told. Forever. Afraid to keep it pumped to a state of extreme alertness where the smallest detail will not happen, keeping it ready to react on the edge of a knife. Discipline to keep him under control through his fear, to overcome him and act tactically. The bottom line is that he does not have time to think and can not afford feelings. Many spectators have different interpretations of their reaction to the embrace of Sandra de Nielsen, but I think it must be interpreted from the perspective of a human whose only experience of embrace is in combat: the tremor represents repressing their fight / flight instincts reacting to fear of being attacked, his movement and vision restricted, fear and discipline in fact. <br /> <br /> Then there is the subtext of his abandonment (twice, in fact), so representative of the way our society tends to pull infantry soldiers into society's garbage heap when they have fulfilled their terms. 40% of the unemployed are former military in OUR world, in YES it can only be worse. Russell quickly takes the mantle of Mace's responsibility to his wife and son, who desperately needs a mission, even one with such a high probability of his death. <br /> <br /> Then there is also the military subtext: the conflict between the church of Busey and the hotshot of HQ, Mekum. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more precise and aggressive. Any of them could hit Todd on the floor, but it's not about the tools you have, but how you use them. An incentive Todd who was given the freedom to exercise his initiative and act without the numbing effect of perceived superiority, uses ambush tactics and clever tricks to get through the newest unit: sent without support, coverage or recognition. It is a reminder that military power can not compensate for a failure in leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle themes. When a film is recorded and presented with a script so minimal, it leaves a lot of blank space for your own interpretations to take root. Look Soldier with an open mind and see what he teaches you.
