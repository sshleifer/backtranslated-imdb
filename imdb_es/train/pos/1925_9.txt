This has to be one of the best comedies on television right now. Take the sweet and sweet idea of ​​a show that revolves around a close family and makes it a fairly realistic but fun representation of a typical family complete with brothers and fathers, dull brothers, overprotective parents and bimbo sisters. I'm almost surprised it's Disney! <br /> <br /> For your credit, '8 Simple Rules' knows it's a comedy and does not try to be more. Too many programs (for example, 'Sister, Sister' and 'Lizzie McGuire') think that because their main characters are now teenagers, they should address social problems and end up losing their humor because they are too forceful. This is a trap that '8 Simple Rules' has avoided; He tackles some problems (such as being an outcast from school) but has fun doing it. In fact, the only time he has been really serious was understandable when he handled with sensitivity the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. <br /> <br /> And I think that, unfortunately, John Ritter will be missed because it was the reason the program left its mark, '8 Simple Rules' can still work well if he remembers his humor and does not make the father of Cate a second version of Paul Hennessy.
