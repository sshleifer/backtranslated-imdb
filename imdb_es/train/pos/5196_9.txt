Human Tornado (1976) is, in many aspects, a better film than its predecessor. The director knew what he had to work with and attended to the limitations of Rudy Ray Moore as an actor. It's a fun movie, technically more solid and acted. The interpreters do not take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time everyone is joking and going with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff as he was in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie a lot and I highly recommend it. Like his first film, it is aimed at a certain audience (I very much doubt that Mr. Moore is trying to expand his audience at this point in his career). Check it! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
