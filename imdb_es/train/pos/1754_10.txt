This movie starts in a funny way from the 15 second mark, and continues throughout the film. I can not remember a scene in which I did not look back at the people who laughed with me. He is the perfect actor for this role due to his appearance and his way of dressing. <br /> <br /> The comic parts were great to see them from not very big or popular actors. As you can see, people like this movie, it currently has a 7.9 rating on IMDb. I think it should be in 250. Let's put it this way, I have not seen this movie so funny from the American pie or the original holiday. See him if he wants to laugh. I give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs I've given since I heard about IMDb, excellent movie site.
