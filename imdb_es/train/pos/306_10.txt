Well, he had seen "Everyone laughed" when it was published in Europe in 1982 and had kept a vague but dear memory of it. I just saw him again on the tape, almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovich has a real tenderness for his characters and a kind sympathy that is hard not to feel too. Excellent comedians and actors, good lines everywhere and for everyone and pretty good editing, too. I laughed and smiled all the time. Like everyone, sometimes. Go for it.
