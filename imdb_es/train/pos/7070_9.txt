One of the most attractive elements of a Gilliam movie is that the well-designed visual elements, the disturbing backgrounds and the characters with manic frustration are evidence of the creator's participation. Instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is a hired director who pays to present a star or two), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through the experience. "12 Monkeys" is evidence of Gilliam's own vision and style, rather than making films out of the ordinary for their own good. "12 Monos" is a variation on similar themes from Gilliam's repertoire: oppressive / recessive societies, the loneliness of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief and parallel realms. In this film, Gilliam does a good job of blurring the lines between the two kingdoms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe instead of knowing. This tendency of Gilliam to stop filling certain gaps leads to criticism of the pretension of the house of art. The difference between Gilliam and the artists is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of her images have a meaning. The two almost identical bathroom scenes of Cole at the beginning are intended to establish comparisons that leave the audience unsolved. His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the future world plagued by diseases, but it makes it recognizable in the world of 1996. The title itself is a mark of Gilliam's creativity, since it requires that most of the story unfolds. so that its meaning is fully understood. In general, Gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch but that also require reflection and interpretation on the part of the audience. The movie has an immense review value, since there are subtle details and suggestions that can be lost in the first viewing. Definitely one of my favorites.
