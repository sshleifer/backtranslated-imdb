It's easy to forget that, once later, the series further developed the alien conspiracy plot, which once, The X-Files wrote episodes like "GenderBender" and "Fearful Symmetry", where the aliens were not small, gray men. or control of mind control, but in reality it might surprise you. <br /> <br /> "Fearful symmetry" starts with an "invisible elephant", actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time, less than a mile from "The Walk" - and ends with a pregnant gorilla being kidnapped. And it is very much an episode of wonderful moments. The secondary argument is annoying, yes, we get it, zoos are bad, except when they are not, but the ideas it contains are fascinating, visually powerful and very memorable, and cover an angle of abduction that is largely overlooked . Why would * humans * be the only things that aliens are interested in? <br /> <br /> In the end, it was not an instant classic, but it was nice to see it while it lasted, again, very memorable, and mainly, it's something you can not imagine doing many other shows.
