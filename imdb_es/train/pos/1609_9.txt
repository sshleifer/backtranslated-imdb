"Moonstruck" is a movie that I liked the first time I saw it. I really liked it the second time. I loved the third time. Now it is one of my favorites of all time. <br /> <br /> The humor is subtle but really good. The movie offers a lot of warm humor. The story takes place in an old-school Italian neighborhood in New York. Cher's search for love is pleasant to watch. This movie is by far the best work that Nicholas Cage has done in the film. The character of the old man is fantastic. Illuminate the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic. But, perhaps the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is a scene in which the main characters enjoy it in an oatmeal breakfast in the family kitchen. Exceptional management and wrapping.
