Well, this could be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy offers a force tour performance! Unfortunately, her career never took off, but, finally, she will always be remembered for her three top-level photos: "The King of Comedy", "The Dallas Doll" and "Without You I'm Nothing". It is dedicated to different people from the New York social society to Diana Ross to create a scathing and hilarious critique of popular culture in the United States. Sexy and fierce, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, she convinces the audience in every scene, and in reality IS "really pretty". Look at this (if you are not from Iowa), you will certainly enjoy it!
