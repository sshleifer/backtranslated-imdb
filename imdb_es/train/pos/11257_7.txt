The erotic cinema of the 1970s was docile compared to the triple X of today, which is good. Because there is a good story about naked rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I would like them to have some vampire effects that they had in the period of time and the sex got a little bit in the story. In addition, some of the accents were difficult to understand in periods of time, but it is worthwhile to see the unedited version and then the edited version titled THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING. But if you do not mind a lot of naked women dancing and having sex, then this is not the movie for you. However, I enjoyed it and I give it ... 7 STARS.
