This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies of its kind. The interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to the cavalry and the code of honor between thieves and policemen. It deals with issues such as duty, guilt, words, manipulation and trust, as few films have done and, unfortunately, none that can be remembered since the death of the "police" in the late seventies. The sequence is delicious, even the essential, does not live anything and, therefore, takes the viewer to a masterful, correct and incorrect plot, without captures of accessory sights and spectacular scenes that are often needed in smaller samples of the genre to maintain to the awake public. There are no such scenes present or necessary. The argument is honest sand for the viewer; An important asset in a genre that too often achieves suspense through the deception of the audience. No, this is not Miss Marble ... A congratulatory note for the music is in order A movie to see and taste every minute, not just to see.
