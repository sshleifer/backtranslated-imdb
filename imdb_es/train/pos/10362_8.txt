Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic interpretation as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain, who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of voracious dingoes as her defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and titled well in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly movie to watch. It presents a scenario that is too real for us in America: the witch hunt against a person considered an easy target. <br /> <br /> Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being a person who said what he thought, someone who did not play the sympathy card and someone who was strong enough to move on with his life despite his ordeal was classified as suspicious and hated beyond comprehension. , even when it was clear that He did not kill his own son. The media began to harden and a gradual invasion of privacy that soon had the whole nation stuck to their sets while eviscerating this family piece by piece. And in spite of everything, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. <br /> <br /> This position, of course, is the power of force, as unfriendly as it may seem, and people react strongly to that. They want to see an anguished mother cry and cry and occasionally faint at every step, not sit there and go blank. People do not understand that not everyone laments in the same way and when someone decides to stand firm they begin to speculate. Meryl Streep embodies this woman stained to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold woman, but not insensitive, who supported his convictions even if they cost him his freedom. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to slowly dissolve his character in despair: someone has to do it, or the Chamberlain would be too distant, and nobody wants to see that. Except that the monster you have at the time of writing this article becomes the news medium. They always eat trains and feed mangled manure to the uninformed public.
