So, what is the reason? Is there any kind of vendetta against this AWESOME show or someone involved in it? Why would the best show I've seen in years be canceled? I am addicted. I saw this program randomly last fall, and I immediately loved it, and saw it every week. Then he left, and I tried Tivo, but it was not being broadcast. So I forgot it for a while, until I found the episodes on the ABC website. Now I want MORE. I agree with everyone else, with the rest of the garbage on today's television, it was comforting to see something as complete and developed as this one. I look Boston Legal for my eccentric-comic correction, and House for my intellectual-mysterious-coarse correction. My wife loves Gray's Anatomy for her "realism", and I love / hate the show, but it could not be further from the real thing for me. Too much drama. Everything that can go wrong, it does. But for once, there is a drama that is REALLY real. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes, like a former gangster who became good, a girl who flees the mob, etc., but these people (especially in New York City) are really out there, and I relate to each one of them. they. It seems that I can not have enough. I just hope that ABC will take their heads off their butts and continue with this program. Get some respect for having a quality drama out there. This could be one of the best shows of all time. If someone simply leaves it.
