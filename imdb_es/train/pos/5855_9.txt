If you played "Spider-Man" in the PS version, then you've seen it all. To really experience it you must obtain the DC version. In a few words, it is a very superior game graphically; the textures are sharp, the levels are easy to navigate and it has a much better sound than the PS. I bought this game at the end of the 00's and it's still up to this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a very superior and strategic game, but if you are a Web Head fan, then you must collect it for your game library. Going around the city like Spidey has never looked so good in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, hook this up cheaply. The DC version is simply amazing.
