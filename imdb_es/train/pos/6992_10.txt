I would not say that this is a bad movie; In fact, it is quite typical of the type of film that the "row of poverty" studios were launching at that time. Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in his role of doctor-scientist somewhat demented, disguised as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and his henchmen have the unpleasant habit of stealing young girlfriends and, after his disappearance, inject Bela's wife with a serum taken from their bodies to support their young man. Lugosi is more than up to the task of making this a pleasant movie, however, the film suffers from the wooden performance of star stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. The coffin (good name for a boy in a horror movie) is especially bad in this case. I've seen it in numerous movies and TV shows and it's always the same; Rigid, wooden and absolutely unconvincing. Miss Walters is just a little better, but she also lacks the talent to act and make her role credible. Even so, the spectator can enjoy the great performance of Lugosi in another cowardly plan that can only be frustrated in the end! Despite the bad performance of some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a nice movie for all to see.
