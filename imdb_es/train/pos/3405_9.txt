"The Garden of Allah" was one of the first Technicolor feature films in 3 bands. To fix a previous poster, Technicolor's first feature (after Disney's 5-year exclusivity agreement) was "Becky Sharp" from 1935, which was a costume drama that used color for its flashy costumes. <br /> <br /> "The Garden of Allah" seems that it could have been filmed years later, since the cinematography uses not only the color, but also the use of shadows. It must have been surprising for an audience at that time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white movies throughout their lives. Unfortunately, the film does not resist filmmaking. That said, the movie is worth seeing as a visual gift alone.
