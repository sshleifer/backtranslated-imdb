In the late 1980s, Warren Beatty created and starred in the Reds epic about the founding of the Soviet Union seen through the iconoclastic radical John Reed. It was a deep, entertaining film with a message presented by a cast of stars. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy that does not pretend to be anything but entertainment with a lot of the best actors from around the world, just having a good time doing it with tons of makeup. <br /> <br /> That both Reds and Dick Tracy could come from the same person who talks a lot about the range that this man has as a player. In this movie, Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in an original script. <br /> <br /> The city's leading mafioso, Big Boy Caprice, is making a move to really eliminate the competition. The film begins with him rubbing the henchmen of Lips Manlis in a shootout in the style of the Valentine's Massacre and then Lips, who is being equipped for a cement coat. But Caprice's movements are making him a target for Tracy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a third mysterious and faceless individual is trying to overthrow Caprice. Will our hero solve this tangle of crime? <br /> <br /> The spirit of fun that this film has is truly contagious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong dresses up scandalously to look like the cartoon creations of the strip author Chester Gould and then they cut the piece of the biggest ham, you have to love this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino got a Best Supporting Actor nomination, but any of these guys might have, it's just that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice has the most screen time. Only Beatty plays it completely straight, everyone else seems to play outside of it. Dick Tracy won the Oscars for Best Art and Set Design, Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and presented by Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact that he could even make someone like Sondheim write a score for this movie only proves that Sondheim wanted to get into the fun. As for Madonna, Material Girl does more than maintain her own weight with all these heavyweights who act as the Torch singer of the Breathless Mahoney club. <br /> <br /> Before this movie, Dick Tracy's films were sent to the B photos and worse still on Saturday. afternoon serials. The only thing that rivals this extravaganza of stars is a radio transmission made by Armed Forces Radio during the Second World War that came to the vinyl. Can you believe a cast like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and the Andrews sisters? Try to find a recording of that gem. <br /> <br /> Until then, Warren Beatty's classic comic strip for the big screen will work well.
