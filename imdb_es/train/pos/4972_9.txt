['LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first movie I saw in 2000 and I doubt you will see a better one this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by the Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage takes place in the empty industrial areas of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) For him. For this the son has to break the record by opening doors. What the father really wants to be his so that his son is someone, because he himself has never done it more as a local news reporter for a newspaper ironically called L&#39;Espoir (Esperanza). Of course, nothing works as planned. This movie can be compared better with the DESCENDING CLOUDS of Aki Kaurismäki, although it is more dramatic and the humor is darker. However, as in that movie, the tone is more melancholy than depressing and the ending is cheerful, without being too happy. The humor is absurd, without making the plot amazing, and Mariage finds impressive images in gloomy environments that never seem artificial. The best of LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the performance of Poelvoorde. This actor rose to fame with the also brilliant classical cult C&#39;EST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then, he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting ability and all the papers that were offered were repetitions of Ben&#39;s character . With his return to a leading role in LCA, there should be no doubt about his performance. He is simply brilliant as a man so stupid and evil as to put his family in misery, but smart enough to realize what he has done and feel remorseful for the remorse about it. You must see it.']
