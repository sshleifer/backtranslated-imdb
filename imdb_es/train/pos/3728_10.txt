I never heard of this movie, I saw it on DVD. Great movie, perfect example of a movie that led all the cast members to make it work. No typical Hollywood movie overwritten with the same old overpriced actors. No current quote from "A" list of actors could I have achieved any performance in this movie. They have brought me memories of my own military experiences after the Vietnam War. He concentrated on the people who were sent to fight. As they portrayed the characters who had fears and emotions, even if some volunteered for the service. They were also normal people, some were simply not made for military life, I remember some in my experience, so to speak, I could not adapt to military life either, but I will never forget them, I should have stayed in touch. I highly recommend it and then think about those who serve today in Afghanistan. The basic training is a trip, notice that the drill sergeants are not people in the morning and maybe they need "sensitivity training" HA! HE HAS! HE HAS!
