This takes about a year after the events in "Basic Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a soccer player while traveling at high speed in a car at 110 miles per hour (do not ask), get off the road and end up in the Thames. She survives, he does not. The police hire psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if she is mentally competent to be judged. Naturally, she begins to play with her mind and many murders and sex follow. <br /> <br /> This movie was doomed even before it opened. It took forever to get a cast and director, the script problems were constant and the cast was not happy (Morrissey complained about the movie often). It is not so bad yet. It is very similar to the first thing: there is an exuberant music, beautiful places, a lot of sex and nudes (this had to be edited by an R), a very intricate plot and good performance, but it has no impact. It feels like a retread of the first. People are being killed here with a choker strap (I think) ... just like people were killed by an ice picket in the first one. In a nice moment, Stone takes an ice pick and looks at it with nostalgia. She is also playing mental games with a man and could be implicating him in murders. The similarities are too obvious. <br /> <br /> This also has a VERY R rating - there are many explicit sexual conversations, male nudes (Morrissey looks much better nude than Michael Douglas), female nudes (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. The acting is good in all areas. The stone is simply fantastic here; Morrissey looks miserable but he's fine; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at supporting roles. <br /> <br /> So, this is not bad at all, but it feels like a remake of the first one. Still, I recommend it. People just attacked this because Stone is not very loved and they thought it was stupid to make a sequel to "Basic ..." 14 years after it was made.
