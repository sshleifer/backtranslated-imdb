This was surprisingly clever for a television movie, and quite true to my own experience of bulimia. Actually, it was well researched, and I can only assume that it was written by someone who has gone through a similar experience, because it had all the little details. The characters were pretty well drawn, and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think what I like most is that they were made specific and intelligent, and there was no explanation of the reasons for Beth's bulimia (it was not a "uncontrolled diet, caused by the pressures exerted on girls by the media" ., pressures that we really are not going to address ... ") His mother was not completely disoriented, too often on television, they will take on a problem of which ALL have some conscience and will try to tell us that their protagonists are the last people who remain on earth who do not know it ("Diabetes? What is that?" Oh, my world is all crooked, doctor, please, explain it to me as if I were a small child, etc.) It was brilliant that his mother she was a psychologist and not even she saw the signs, and the scenes in which Beth was vomiting were not MUCH melodramatic and sensationalist, and focused more on the need for secrecy of the bulimics and their uncontrolled control. The scene where Beth tells her mother that she is bulimic would have made me cry if there were no other people in the room. <br /> <br /> Well, then I liked those parts. What did not work out so well was the ending, which goes back to the territory of the television movie we know and do not love especially, but I suppose they had to summarize it. "You can also cure your child's eating disorder, if you have a lot of money and live in the United States ..." <br /> <br /> And I can say again that I really like Mare Winningham. She's great.
