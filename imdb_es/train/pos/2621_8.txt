Disney has done it again. Brilliant the way Timone and Pumbaa come back to life once again to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when he needed them. I love this movie and I see it again and again. It shows how Timone lived with his family and his fellow meerkats before leaving to find the home of his dreams and adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and things change. Together, they look for the home that Timon wants and fails repeatedly, which is fun since Timone becomes more and more insane. Then Simba appears and we see more of his childhood than in the 2 previous films. The rest you already know.
