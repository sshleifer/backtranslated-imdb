If I could go back, even as an adult and relive the days of my summer in the camp ... I would be there so fast. The camps I went to were not even that good. They were in Texas, where mosquitoes actually carry people, but we had horses and we fished. The cinematography of the film was amazing, the characters fun and believable, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. The character of Sam Raimi and the sub-arrangements were priceless. So, who thought this movie was boring ...? I feel a deep sorrow because you can not suspend your disbelief long enough to imagine camping life again as an adult or you were never a child. The point was that these people had the opportunity to return and become juveniles again, and they did so at every opportunity. I wish I could. It was fun, intelligent, beautifully written, brilliant and the art returns me, so I want to see it again and again just on stage. Sorta as Dance with Wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies, but the desert becomes a character as much as the actors. Rent it, see it, buy it and see it again and again ... it never gets old. ; 0)
