This is a brief and starkly animated series by David Lynch (as it is said at the beginning), and follows the misadventures of a large, large man, with a wife who has a stress disorder and an upset child. Both elements are clipped repeatedly in the short episodes, and there is no real plot that can be seen. It's easier if you think of this as an exceptionally strange and slightly macabre Looney Tunes, with much more gore, blasphemy, bloody violence and occasional moments of hilarity. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD together with Eraserhead, having previously seen Eraserhead. Do not look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece, this is nothing. In fact, it seems to be almost a statement against such things, as their harsh style spits out at any kind of animation convention you can see. As Lynch says, "If this is funny, it's funny because we see the absurdity of everything."
