['Thomas Capano was not Anne Marie&#39;s boss, Tom Carper, the governor was. That&#39;s why the feds got involved, called Clinton and asked her to involve the feds in the case. I lived outside of Philadelphia at that time, so the case was front-page news every day. I also read Ann Rule&#39;s book and saw the segment &quot;Confidential of the city&quot; in A &amp; E. Tom Capano was a megalomaniac (sp.), A super controller and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie, but all he wanted was someone he could control. When she did not let him do that anymore, he killed her, the last form of control. I think it&#39;s a waste of money that is still alive.']
