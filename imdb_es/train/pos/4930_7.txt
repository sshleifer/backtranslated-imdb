"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I was a bit disappointed. The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never explores it or develops it. It's well done and it's entertaining, but it's not as interesting as it should have been. The script of this is really weak and makes the whole movie fall. None of the central characters is really convincing or credible. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the movie is very well made, so it compensates for the weakness of the scripts. The direction of Elia Kazan keeps the film in suspense and moves at a dizzying pace. There are some outstanding sequences, particularly the memorable climax of the persecution. When his address was combined with better film scripts several years later, the man could hardly make a mistake. <br /> <br /> The acting is also very good. Richard Widmark was always a visible leader and does what he can with a subscribed character. Paul Douglas spends his time screaming too much but he also does a decent job. Those featured in the cast are the two villains. Zero Mostel, known mainly for his comic roles, is effectively one of the best toady characters in the cinema. Jack Palance is, as expected, a creepy villain. "Panic in the Streets" is disappointing, but it's worth seeing. (7/10)
