Ok, I admit it. I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this movie, but beyond his good looks, the film develops with an argument that is sometimes predictable, but reasonable. <br /> <br /> Starting, we are introduced to the three women leaders of the film. One of them is a director, very concerned about her image and never married. A police officer - with a child and a bad ex to talk. The third: a doctor hungry for power and status with a desire for recognition and three ex. <br /> <br /> They are almost the "First Wives Club", and in fact there are many verbal attacks from ex-involved as well as some "Left the credit card" behavior. Set of characters: the movie continues. <br /> <br /> The character of McDowell, the director, is late for a funeral, where a young organist, who shows up for the regular player (Doughty), gets his attention. What will your two friends say about the resulting prank? Will they live happily ever after? <br /> <br /> A handkerchief or two recommended if you are the type with tears: the end is encouraging, but it may not be what you expect. In general, a great movie that stands out among Schlock's current options for action, special effects and horror.
