Initially I had heard about TEARS OF KALI a while ago and it sounded like something I would be into, but with all the movies I regularly go on, I dropped off the radar. While wandering around the local WonderBook ... I saw the box of this one and grabbed it. I have to say that I am very happy to have done it. TEARS OF KALI is a strange, bloody, sometimes downright chilling film, which is somewhat limited by its low budget, but it's still an entertaining and valuable watch. <br /> <br /> TEARS OF KALI focuses on fiction based on India. The cult group Taylor-Erikkson, who practices meditation and other rituals in the quest to confront and banish the "inner demons" of the individual, but apparently these techniques work well or not well enough (depending on your point of view. ..) so dark The forces are not only exorcised, but also unleashed on unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> The film is said to be "anthological style", with a brief but memorable introduction sequence and "that opens the eyes", and then continues towards the three stories that make up most of the film. <br /> <br /> The first one (SHAKTI) is about a journalist who visits one of the members of the cult who is confined in a psychiatric hospital. The journalist takes cover to want to investigate the cult of Taylor-Erikkson, but we found that her real motives can hit a little closer to home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist discovers that she could have gotten upside down ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) refers to a violent young man who is condemned to psychological rehabilitation instead of of a prison sentence for hitting a young man in a coma. We find that the treating physician in question is actually a "student" of Taylor-Erikkson, and his methods of rehabilitation are far from the norm ... <br /> <br /> The final story (KALI) revolves around a quack "faith -the healer" and his assistant who performs "miracles" for a fee. When the healer, unknowingly, helps one of his clients and actually expels a force that possessed it, the demon is now free to roam and look for a new host ... <br /> <br /> I have to say I REALLY ENJOYED KALI COTTONS. There are some flaws with the film that prevent it from being really excellent, but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is. My biggest complaint with the production is the poor and uninspired dialogue about doubled. The dubbing is below average and I would have preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track. Some critics have said that acting is bad, which I do not necessarily agree with. I think the dubbing is so lackluster that it makes the performances seem atrophied, which is not really the case. In fact, some of the performances are quite chilling (the "doctor" in the second segment and the "client" in the third come to mind ...) and remarkable. The gore FX are very well made for a low budget movie, with some graphic scenes of eyelid removal scissors through cuticles, a pencil suicide in the throat, a decent self (but irritatingly "shaky") -figuration, and some other goodies launched in good measure. Not as rude as some of the more extreme "gore" movies that exist, but definitely stronger than your average horror rate. I also found that the story about the cult group is intriguing and a welcome change to the typical nonsense of the horror story. There are many scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension, like the ones I have not seen in a long time. Although with flaws in some fundamental aspects, I still think that TEARS OF KALI will attract the majority of the "clandestine" horror spectators: some scenes may be too much for the more conventional spectator. Definitely recommended - 8.5 / 10
