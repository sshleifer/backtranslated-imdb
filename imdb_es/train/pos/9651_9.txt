What at first seemed like just another introverted French film that offered only a baneful feeling became for me, in the second presentation, a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation. <br /> <br /> Below is a kind of spoiler. <br /> <br /> Poor Cedric; apparently he did not know what hit him. Poor audience at first we were caught up in what seemed like a really beautiful and romantic story, only to be taken from one place to another in the dark reality of the mismatch. These two guys just did not belong together since their first ambiguous encounter. Although Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional bond made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find satisfaction in sharing life with someone whose sensitivity was more in tune with the carnival festivities and the events in the world. Beach. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical note, I loved the action of the camera in this film. The subtitles were totally unnecessary, although my French is "presque rien". I could see it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. This was a polished film, made very professionally. Although many scenes seem superfluous, I rate it with nine out of ten.
