I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed at my ass during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like him in his serious films, especially Truman Show. This is a cross between your VERY funny side, and your serious side. He is, of course, VERY funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he does it very easily. He is truly a multifunctional actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with Jennifer Aniston's performance. I think it's more than a couple of nice tits and a big ass. Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God. As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY fun, especially in the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> In general, I would have to rate this as 9. Good acting, funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good movie.
