10 out of 10, this brilliant and super documentary is a must see, with clips from the war that people did not see for years, until it was screened in 1974. The clips of the film in this documentary of the war are not lost Any thing, some of the clips left me stunned. The complete series has more than 20 episodes, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells an impressive war story. Simply, this is still probably the best documentary of the war, and now, with more than 25 years, it is still capable of giving a tremendous blow. You must see this at some point, even if it is about some episodes, even at that moment you will be surprised by the impact that this documentary means for those who have been there suffered and died in the name of WAR, in a WORLD IN WAR.
