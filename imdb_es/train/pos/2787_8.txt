Originally I rented this movie for my daughter since she is interested in football, and I was not disappointed in that way (except the plot that interfered with the soccer scenes). As a parent, I guess I was a bit surprised at the introduction to the issue of lesbianism, but I must admit that, as a parent, these problems are completely available to children today (as uncomfortable as I feel about the subject). In a way, this emotion was a consequence of the main premise of the film: that at a certain age you must trust that your children will make their own decisions. This dilemma is presented by a young teenager born in the United Kingdom, Jasminder (Jess), of East Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional football. The pending marriage of his older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage gives him many opportunities to explore (in a pleasant way) his hopes and fears about his future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with her parents' expectations of her, once again not as different as most parent-child relationships . <br /> <br /> In SUMMARY, the soccer scenes are BIG (there is a lot to learn in slowmo) and although I did not need the story, something was needed to keep the film going.
