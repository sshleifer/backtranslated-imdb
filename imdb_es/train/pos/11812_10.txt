This movie is the best movie to see the comic feeling. The sets, the costumes and the color are so vivid that it's like entering a comic. This is the movie that I think of when it comes to the mafia, the costumes, the hats and the attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives comic relief like Mumbles and you can not help but feel sorry for Madonna while trying. , and fails, to beat Tracy. This film contains all the clich√©s of the classic mafia: burying people in particular, blowing up people's cars, tying the good man and trying to blow up his girlfriend's house. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic in every way. The word, even the camera angels shout comic. It's great to be able to go back to an old movie and see that someone knew how a comic should become a movie after seeing mistakes like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!
