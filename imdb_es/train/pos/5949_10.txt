Hi again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and believable story of romance and intrigue. The music in wonderful and memorable. Very good color film. Another film that I also liked later was High Society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music Thanks for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
