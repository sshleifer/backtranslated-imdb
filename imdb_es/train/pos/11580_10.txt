As another critic says, Hanna's War is an outstanding film about a prominent person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who would become the Jewish Joan of Arc. Unfortunately, I am amused in the opinion that I do not agree that Miss Detmers is too beautiful to be taken as a resistance fighter. Truly for me, his performance is not held back by his beauty, but makes him even more rigid in the terror of sadistic brutality as a resistance he faces. The performance of Maruschka Detmers is brave, moving, sincere or understood, and totally credible. In other words for me "in the zone". From the opening credits. If you would like to learn about someone else's suffering for something they believe in and be impressively entertaining, try the Hanna War with Maruschka Detmers. I also take my hat off to Ellen Burstyn, like Hanna's mother, a well-known and famous actress who could have made an effort to leave with the film. In that it is a team effort of two actresses, but not a situation of Everything about Eva.
