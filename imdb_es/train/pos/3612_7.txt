Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school student who discovers she has a powerful punch and starts training as an amateur in a Brooklyn gym. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, barely older than her, who also trains there. They meet after class, so to speak, and are attracted to each other. No sex Santiago was instructed to save it for his next fight. <br /> <br /> Both participate in a "gender blind" athletic program that makes no distinction between men and women, a wrong attempt to level the athletic playing field. <br /> <br /> A radio commentator Conservative recently announced, and I swear I'm not inventing, "Let's face it, the president is black." I am here to make an equally insightful observation: "Men and women are different." Now, in 99 cases out of every 100, this makes no difference in physical performance. But in the first one percent, trained athletes whose skills have been honed to the limit, men generally have the advantage. With their narrow hips they can run faster. And they have more muscle mass and strength in the upper part of the torso. These differences in body make it possible for women to give birth and raise children and for men to catch and kill food for them. This sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection. Without it, there could be no humans at all. And that's why, boys and girls, that's why they have events for men and events for women in the Olympic Games. I speak to you as your anthropologist. That will be ten cents, preferred PayPal. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this program blind to the genre as wrong. As talented as a boxer like Rodrigues is, as she approaches the zenith of the game, she will eventually lose to a man. <br /> <br /> That's where the complication comes in this movie. Rodrigues is finally compared to her boyfriend, Douglas. Neither wants to lose the anger for the other, without mentioning the rights of the motor home, but the pride of both is at stake, and pride is personal and is related to gender. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is offended by what she sees as her condescending attitude. Ends happy <br /> <br /> I really did not expect much from the movie. I thought it would be a scam of Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" until I discovered that this was released years earlier. And I had never heard of the director or any of the artists. That kind of darkness, in general, portends badly done, for those who cry on television, etc. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised how ordered this is. The total absence of bathos left me with my mouth open. So did the minimal use of boxing clich√©s: the frayed strings, the blood, the cut of the swollen eye, the battered faces after the fight, the fat and sweaty crying "Kill him!", The slow-motion landing of the glove Nose , the sweat dew of the mutilated head, the heroic music that signals the expected apotheosis of the victor. None of that here, well, almost none. The whole plot could be considered formulated. The difficult child finds a way out in the ring, etc. <br /> <br /> The feeling that you have left is that this is probably pretty much what these amateur contests are. Different from what we see on television and in the common movies. The bells do not ring, for example, a referee who dances and watches shouts "Stop! And" Box! "The contestants wear headwear, the gym is not populated by a crowd of spectators, but by a handful of people who have a particular interest in the events, it's a clean movie, despite the rather grim scenery and the unhappy family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez can look pretty bad, with her muscular body and eyes Shining under her low forehead, but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can defeat you anytime she wants, and once you hear the feminine contours of her supersegmentals, it's not bad. the one that she is fighting against her father on the floor is exaggerating.) It was a bit difficult to understand Douglas's moderation when Rodriguez crawls on him in bed.The director, Karyn Kusama, has carefully chosen his talent. <br /> <br /> Show what you can do with some talent, imagination and a minimum of money. There should be more movies like this one. Take one of those billionaire blockbusters full of dinosaurs or spaceships and spread a little generosity.
