*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My dad had recorded this movie for me when I was 3 years old. At 5 years old, he had seen it more than 400 times. I only saw it and I saw it. And I still do it today! It has a grim story, the mother of a lamb is killed by a wolf, a very emotional scene, and wants to become a wolf, like him. After years of training, the lamb becomes a really REALLY evil thing. He and the wolf travel to his old barn, but he can not kill the lambs, however much he wishes. He ends up killing the wolf, but his old friends no longer see him as a lamb and can not return to his former way of life. <br /> <br /> The art is beautiful, the songs are ... Well, it's fine, and the voice acting is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> In general, only * you * have * to see this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
