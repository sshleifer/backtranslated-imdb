Hrm: I think that line was from the posters of the old movies. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie that seems to have been translated from a language that was totally unknown to the translator. Here is a tip: any movie that starts with a black screen and a text that says "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to them. <br /> <br /> In this case, "In the future ..." means that, instead of wars of war, nations make men go up to giant robots and duke to determine, well, that's never It's so clear, but it's probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously, capitalists, that is, "we") and bad guys (Comies!) And there are big stop-motion robots. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the effects budget was quite low, so we did not do it. I can not see much of the big robots. There are a lot of cheap looking interior scenes, and then a big space fight near the end. The spatial fight is especially nice, since it does not serve for anything more than for the rest of the effects budget. <br /> <br /> With the money already spent, the climatic fight degenerates (and I'm not doing anything). this up) two boys hitting each other with sticks. I can always laugh in a bar recreating the final scene, complete with a last line that guarantees that any audience will scratch their heads. <br /> <br /> Like I said, it's nonsense. That's why I bought the tape.
