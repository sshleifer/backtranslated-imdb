For a while I was caught in the trap where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I liked them. Fatty Drives the Bus is the exception. It's true. It is the best "bad" movie in history. <br /> <br /> The "badness" of this movie seems to be natural. Halfway through Satan's opening monologue, the word "Hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The glamorous Bridget is an unshaven man with a wig and a second-hand store dress. It takes the eccentric couple trying to kill each other ALWAYS to go down the stairs. Jesus walks towards a funk soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Fatty gives the impression that someone lost his mandate for advising the film project of an older adult. But it is the sincerity of the bad that is what makes it so wonderful. He has the impression that the manufacturers knew he was going to be bad, but they never forced him. <br /> <br /> It will never be duplicated with amazement, Fatty fulfills. Highly recommended
