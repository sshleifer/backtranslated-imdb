Alain Resnais's films are strange in the way they are not really edited by continuity, but instead the shot seems to end right where a memory has been edited. The Love of Death is sometimes a silent existential drama and a realistic and magically realistic film, and in any case it treats the audience with an entirely new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or perhaps it creates a new relationship, the of Agape / Thanatos. <br /> <br /> The beginning is like a strange surreal horror movie. A woman runs desperately through the house while a man lies dying in his bed. Did he kill him or what happened? Soon that tension dissolves when a doctor arrives and declares him dead, but from there a new and strange drama begins: the man wakes up and, after being dead, the woman and the man fall in love with quite tragic consequences. Meanwhile, his friends, who are both priests, observe and present their own debate about the nature of love, faith and devotion. <br /> <br /> Resnais always seems to have some device to make this kind of narrative work. And what is so amazing about his films is that those devices always work. In this case, Resnais intersperses the scenes with snow shots falling to an exciting orchestral score, which fades and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story. Trapped in this elegiac periodically, the film develops a rhythm not unlike an epic poem, and I got strange flashbacks of Dante's Divine Comedy, despite the lack of direct reference within the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but it extends beyond the structure of cinema to something that forces a degree of introspection on the viewer, who has the possibility of bringing to the surface some strange memories. Memory-narrative, create resnais. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
