When I get to the "backside" of the 35, I shake my head more and more in crazed sex, teenagers influenced by today's drugs. It was great to remember that it was as crazy for me in my time as it was for today's teenagers. This movie takes that point home to the core. If you're a 70's fan, you'll love the movie. From KISS-posters to an Angel concert, this movie is cool! <br /> <br /> Look out for a young Laura Dern. Why did not they have more Runaways songs than I'll ever know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with the character of Randy Quaid deflowering a 16-year-old girl. While he was away, she and her friends have a party that destroys a guy's house. The cops come and everything, but not to mention all the children who drink and how these children got these things. <br /> <br /> Foxes belongs there with Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of the anguish movies for teens of all time. <br /> <br /> I mean, buy it and see it with your children and we talk about everything.
