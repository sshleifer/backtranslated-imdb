Greetings again from the darkness. Stunning photographs highlight this Disney documentary and offer a glimpse of the hardness of the animals that live in the desert. For anyone over 40, Disney and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom provided much of our understanding of wild animals from our childhood ... when there was no dedicated channel for National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> What always fascinates is how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. Watching the elephants walk for days, almost delirious from lack of water, is so painful. But their night battle against the lions is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some of the underwater shots are breathless. The humpback's mother and baby are beautiful and watching the great white shark attack its prey is as chilling as "Jaws." The most amazing landscape for me were the breathtaking views of the Himalayas. I had never seen so many details of the immensity of the range. <br /> <br /> I do not think most children today are very excited about this, but it is surely one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries I have. never seen.
