After reviewing this intense martial arts film for the first time in almost 18 years, I must say that it lost nothing of its mysticism, nor of its striking martial arts action as I remembered from my youth. The story of a dying instructor of martial arts sending his student "unfinished" to look for the 5 previous members of his Poison Clan, so they do not look for a fortune that the teacher's friend keeps hidden. Fearing that his last student did not have enough training, he tells him to befriend one of the five "poisons" to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about choreography or camera work A good movie in its own right and, possibly, one of the best martial arts films ever made. A CLASSIC!!
