Write this down in the victory column, this was an excellent movie. The acting performances were excellent and the script was equally excellent. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was magnificent as the Riverside police officer, Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. She was a rookie cop in the Riverside Police Department. He ended up in an affair with a co-worker who knew he had a wife and children, while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (the appearance of Ray Liotta) did a great job as the confused, often stuttering, police officer who had an affair with Gina. He was a stoic as an officer, but it was the opposite of dealing with his feelings and his extramarital relationship. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, especially from the comedy "Wings", did a good job as the calm, meek and underperforming sociopath. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but beneath the surface lay a cold-hearted killer. Weber really took the image of a young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young children. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Each scene, each verbal exchange allows us to know more and more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal job with days of condensation, if not weeks of events in a 90-minute movie. This movie was a good example of doing a lot with little.
