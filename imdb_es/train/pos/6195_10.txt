After watching this movie for months, it is still jumping in my conscience and I feel that I should buy it or at least see it again, even though I saw it at least 3 times when I rented it at that moment. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Hal Hartley's address many years ago; I discovered that these films could make me laugh in a place that is rarely entertained. It's a strange feeling, of course, and I guess most people do not really understand it, or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable. I think I really understand it, it's as if these films were made for me. <br /> <br /> Although I do not remember if I really laughed out loud during this movie, it's still one of the funniest movies I've seen in many years. If you do not see the humor of the shopping bag that Fay brings from the street to the church, to the office of the publisher of his brother, to the office of the director of his son, he may lack the intelligence to be very impressed with this movie The bag is a silent character in itself, being dragged like an icon of motherhood that Parker Posey, usually reckless and impolite, must take before the international intrigue of the rest of the movie that harasses her. <br /> <br /> I consider it "Henry Fool" my least favorite of Hartley's films. Honestly, I do not remember it very well. I think the character itself was so despicable that I found it tedious. Hartley's fort seems to be the development of the female character. <br /> <br /> Aside from the brilliance of Posey, it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses, again. His extravagant ingenuity is perfect for Hartley's management. His ability to make outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony in everything. <br /> <br /> This film explodes into a highly relevant story of international intrigue, which explains the political situations in Afghanistan. This is never suspected at first. The complexity of the development of this film is unparalleled. <br /> <br /> This is the epitome of an "independent" sequel. The less you know about Henry Fool, the more mystery he gets around him, the less you wait for his appearance towards the end of the film, like an alcoholic chain smoking machine, hurling insults at his Islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him. . . It's like discovering that Santa Claus is actually a 12-year-old school bully. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed and satisfied with Hartley's other recent films "The Girl from Monday" and "No Such Thing," "Fay Grim" goes way beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality that no Oscar winner would ever dare.
