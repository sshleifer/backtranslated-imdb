['I had never heard of this movie before I saw it, I was wondering if it was an independent film and I was right, but with a good cast I decided to take a chance. Basically, the vagabond Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for work, and meets with bar owner Wayne Brown (JT Walsh of Pleasantville). He is given a large sum of money, confused with a hit man he has. hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct it, takes the money and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes a counter offer, decides that she needs to leave. When Wayne knows his true identity, he chases Michael by firing a large gun, until he gets into a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the hit man for whom he was confused, and quickly retires. Go back to Suzanne and, knowing that both are in danger, plan to leave the city together and add another complication by falling for each other. However, before leaving, Suzanne insists that they go and steal a large amount of money in the safe. Of course, things are not going to go well, and Wayne and Lyle reach them, and Lyle forces them, and now they tie Wayne to go find the money buried. In the end, Lyle and Wayne get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne get on a moving train together, but it is obvious that she cares more about the money and also gets what she deserves. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as truck driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, aside from maybe a lame Boyle, are fine, and he has a good feeling of black cinema for a black comedy thriller. Very well!']
