Although the hard Boiled of John Woo is my favorite movie number 1. But I have to say that the history of the police is my favorite movie number 2. I say this because the dangerous scenes, the fights and the action in my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the railing at the top of the school mall, grabs a stick surrounded by Chrismas lights and slides down the pole. through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor. OH! Buy it on amazon.com for 14:98. Undary (orchen for $ Descargas). VHS new home video line. Any question or comment please feel free to respond. (I'm only 14 years old, but I know where you can find any movie you've made.) If you're looking for a movie everywhere and can not find it, please respond. Thank you and good night!
