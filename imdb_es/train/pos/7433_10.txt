My mom took me to see this movie when it came out on Christmas 1976. I loved it at that time and now I love it. I know everyone makes fun of Barbra's hair in this one, but I think it looks and sounds great! ... And I seem to remember a number of women who copied that permanent look at that moment! Also, the bathtub scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is very sexy! The music is also great. This is the wonderful Babs of the 70s at its best!
