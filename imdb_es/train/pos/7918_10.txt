I really liked that movie. In fact I loved being an actress in this movie. I appeared as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. Maybe you remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself in the movie. I was the woman in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were seeing in the movie projector. In fact, they took me a couple of times so it's hard to overlook that mistake. Thumbs up to the full moon high. I hope he gets to the cable soon.
