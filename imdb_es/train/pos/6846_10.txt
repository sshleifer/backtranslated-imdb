The film gets my stamp of approval. The scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue. This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of cinema. Dickinson's character, Kate, is very well developed and his performance is felt throughout the film. The best work that Angie Dickinson did from Point Blank!
