Billy Wilder is co-credited by the story, and his unsentimental touch is noted in this rather original tale of ghost writing composers who both work for the legend of burned music Oliver Courtney. The obvious misunderstandings are quickly eliminated, thanks to the sky, and what remains is an ingenious and windy combination with some fine songs (and some more forgettable ones), Crosby at its most charming moment, a great turn of Mary Martin, the Broadway legend and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant provide most of the cynical quills (Levant is in a weird way and his jokes have not had any quotations). A pleasant surprise, and recommended for all fans of the genre.
