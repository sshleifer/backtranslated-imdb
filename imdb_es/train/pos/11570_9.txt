Elmer Fudd is laughing as he rests in his chair and reads his comic book, his dog comfortably asleep near the fireplace. Everything is peaceful until a flea that bounces comes. (The flea is dressed in a farmer's suit with a big hat and carries a bag with the name "A. Pulga.") He pulls out his telescope and sees the dog. (We see a large shot of the dog's backside and the flea whistles enthusiastically, shouting "T-Bone!" Then he sings: "There's food around the corner, there's food around the corner!") <Br /> <br /> That establishes the plot of this cute but unpleasant flea that torments the poor dog. The mutt is hilarious as it reacts to the flea. <br /> <br /> The drawings of his huge teeth nibbling right next to the fleeing flea are smart and the dog's dialogue made me laugh out loud several times. This could be the funniest canine I've seen in a caricature! The poor dog, under the threat of having to bathe, does not react when the stupid flea causes him pain. It is almost painful to see how the flea uses picks, pneumatic hammers and the like in the dog. Put firecrackers behind the dog. It's brutal!
