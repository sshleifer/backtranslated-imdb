I am inclined to any film that paints a lush image of Italy, in my opinion, the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was quite short, unusually so for a period piece, and a bit lacking in the cinematographic aspect. However, the excellent story makes up for it. The four ladies embark on a much needed relaxed vacation with problems in their minds. Throughout the film, they realize their problems and begin to solve them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle in which they stay, has a lovely effect on people. "It's a love tub," says Lottie Wilkins. You can see their gradual change from unsatisfied to exuberant as the Italian coast makes its magic with them. <br /> <br /> All your problems and their solutions are credible. The actresses were great. The background music seemed very appropriate for a romantic Italian setting. In short, a 10/10 movie for me.
