This is my favorite movie of all time. It used to be my Friday night movie with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was single. The first time I saw this movie with my aunt Brend and her sister Chasity. I was in the second grade. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend. I've read a lot of comments about why Bud left Sissy and how Sissy has to "learn to act" married. But let's go back and look at this for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now, not when I was eight years old, this is about Bud & Sissy's relationship that takes a turn for the worst because he makes a fool of himself when Gilley is riding the bull. They get into a big fight. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance. Sissy then thinks that two mistakes will be correct and Wes asks if he "needs help". Everyone is on the dance floor acting like fools when Bud asks Pam, "When will you take me home and rape me?" Pam responds: "When you're ready, cowboy." Bud then goes home with Pam to her condo in downtown Houston. What dad bought for her with oil money and "everything that implies". Bud is the one who cheats on Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day. Sissy is the one that leaves Bud. So, it's up to Bud to show Sissy that he's a real "cowboy" and get her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my interpretation. Everyone has their I'm sure! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I have a real cowboy! I love it too! :)
