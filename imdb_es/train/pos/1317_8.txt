This anime was underestimated and still is. Hardly the dorky movie for children, as has been pointed out, I still come back to this 10 years after the first time I saw her. One of the best movies released. <br /> <br /> The animation is not perfect though, the tricks of the camera give it a 3D feel and the story is still so good today, even after I grew up and saw innovative people like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. Obviously it is not deep enough, but try to see it from a happy view. It's a story to entertain, not to question. <br /> <br /> It's still one of my favorites. I also return when I feel like a giggle in more cheerful animes. Not to say that they are children's movies, there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humor to see everything.
