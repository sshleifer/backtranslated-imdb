Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs, and mixes them to create a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former district attorney, Kate Capshaw and he is a crusader against the death penalty. Blair Underwood's grandmother, Ruby Dee, slaps Connery at a conference and convinces him to handle the appeal of his grandson. He is sitting on the death row for the murder of a young woman. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this rural county of Florida, he faces a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, who is as ruthless in his resolution of crimes as Orson Welles. I was in Touch of Evil. <br /> <br /> Later, after Connery annuls the verdict with the evidence he has discovered, he feels pretty good about himself. At that time, the film takes a decided turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that it is not all that it seems is to say it gently. The cast rotates evenly in some good performances. Special mention must be made of Ed Harris, who plays a Hannibal Lecter as a serial killer on death row with Underwood. It will make your skin wrinkle and begin to make Connery reconsider some of those comfortable liberal premises on which he has based his convictions. Many of the confirmed liberals I know have come out thinking very differently once they have become victims of a crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, the opposite is equally true. Many of the law and order conservatives, if they ever get involved on the wrong side of the criminal justice system, want to make sure that all their rights are truly guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not an end, but a process AND an endless process for the whole society. I suppose if the Just Cause has a moral, it probably would be.
