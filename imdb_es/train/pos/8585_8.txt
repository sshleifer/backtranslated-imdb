A fascinating and fascinating story of the captured coat of the US Army. UU That he has to prove his innocence to avoid the executioner. Paul Ryker dodges friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military tribunal that he was actually a US spy on a secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> In the vein of classic court dramas, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well-designed mystery, skillfully guided by an outstanding cast, the constant impulse of director Kulik and twists and turns of plot effective. <br /> <br /> This film was originally made as a film for television in 1964 and subsequently reinforced. this review with the presence of many "name" actors, and some action sequences. Dillman, repeating his role, is the dubious defense attorney, whose attentions sometimes deviate from the personal situation of the supporting woman, although somewhat distant from Ryker, played with aplomb by Vera Miles. Peter Graves is at the forefront of the indictment, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key support roles. <br /> <br /> Marvin's interpretation of the character of Paul Ryker is a balanced representation of a simple but dedicated man whose posture is normal. the behavior of the back is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which it finds itself. Marvin changes perfectly from resigned indifference to passionate determination, giving a compelling, often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama. It is this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place in the best lists of dramas of the court. <br /> <br /> However, despite its apparent darkness, "Sergeant Ryker" remains a tense subject and a compelling test, like a book you can not stop reading. Highly recommended
