I can not say if the post-World War II British comedies produced at Ealing Studios are an acquired taste or not, but I am completely addicted, and The Man in the White Suit is one of the best. There is no need to delve into the well-known story about the threat that an indestructible and dirt-resistant fiber represents to the textile industry and textile unions. Suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic Sidney Stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make it a comical delight. Many of the familiar faces of the actors of British characters, such as the nervous Cecil Parker, the soft and carefree Michael Gough and the ruthless Ernest Thesinger, are wonderful. Guinness, as always and forever, is excellent, and Joan Greenwood is delicious as Daphne (as the word "Dad" enunciates, it makes it worth seeing the whole movie). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!!"
