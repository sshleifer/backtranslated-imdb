['If you&#39;re as fanatical about an author as I am about Jim Thompson, it can be quite dangerous when your works become a movie. This is not the case with Scott Foley&#39;s interpretation of AFTER DARK MY SWEET. A classic classic of suspense and sexual charge that follows closely and does great justice to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward give possibly the best performances of their careers. And the always phenomenal Bruce Dern could even have joined this one. Like Thompson&#39;s book, this film creates a dark and surreal world in which passion overcomes logic and the double cross is never far away. A must for all fans of the great black movie. **** !!!']
