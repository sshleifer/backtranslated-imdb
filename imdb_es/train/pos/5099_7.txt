The only reason I came across this movie is that it is on the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend you watch it, although you will not like it as much as the best known movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as swindler and his partner. The film starts off rather lightly, but becomes more dramatic when Coop plans to use his daughter to extort money from his brother-in-law, but when he meets the girl and sees the discipline to which he would be subject with his brother - in the law he chooses to keep it. However, he has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path, so the drama unfolds. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley still manages to steal the scenes she is in. There is little music in this, and Shirley Solo has a song. However, this is entertaining and worth seeing together with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
