Over Her Dead Body was a good little movie. It was decent and entertaining, although it was still pretty funny. There were some clich√©s, but I found that most things were cool. At first I did not think it was going to be good at all, when it started. If you can spend the first 20 minutes, the movie starts to be more interesting. This movie did not laugh in a funny way, and it was not wonderful OH MY GOSH. It was just a movie that you can sit and enjoy how nice it was. I do not see why this movie was bad. Your rating is a bit too low. I could have dealt with a 5.5, but with a 4.8. A 1 is shameful. It was pretty good, and there was nothing horrible enough to give it a 1, which is what most people gave it.
