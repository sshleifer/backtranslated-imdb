I have to be honest and say that I have not seen many independent films, but I thought that this was very well done. The direction and the cinematography were attractive without becoming a distraction. The angles, adjustments and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped. Many unforgettable and memorable images of the film remain in your mind long after it is finished (it is always a sign of a good director).
