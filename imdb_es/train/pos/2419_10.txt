In addition to Plans, Trains and Automobiles and Uncle Buck, this is the funniest movie by John Candy. When he is hypnotized with the game card (similar to the Manchurian candidate) and becomes a hot guy who does not know what he is saying, he makes two very memorable quotes (both are about male anatomy). The love scene that involves edible items must be seen, can not be described. <br /> <br />
