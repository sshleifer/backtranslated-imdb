This movie has so many wonderful elements! The debut performance of Reese Witherspoon is, of course, wonderful, but so is her chemistry with Jason London. The score is remarkable, windy and pure. James Newton Howard improves the quality of any movie he composes by ten. He also seems to have a special ability for the films of the lost days of youth, be sure to capture your score for the recent "Peter Pan" and the gothic music of "The Village". The first time I saw this movie was at 13 or 14 years old and now I do not just cry at the end, I shed a tear or two for the nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. It will end up becoming a comfort film for life.
