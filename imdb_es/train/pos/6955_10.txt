['My Super X-Girlfriend is a hell of a roller coaster. The special effects were excellent and the suits that Uma Thurman wore were hubba buba. Uma Thurman is an underestimated comedy actress, but she proved that everyone was wrong and fulfilled her role as a crazy girlfriend. She was simply fabulous! Luke Wilson was also good as the average Joe, but he was a brave man to work with one of the best actresses of all time. The cast was also excellent, especially Anna Faris, who was extremely good (much better than in the Scary Movie franchise). <br /><br /> Ivan Rietman did very well in directing this film because if it were not for him and for Uma Thurman, this film would not have done so well. This film is clearly a 10/10 for its cast (Uma Thurman), its director, its script and from its original plot. This movie is highly recommended.']
