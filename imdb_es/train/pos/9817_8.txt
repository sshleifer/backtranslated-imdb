I remember this movie. Quite intense for an 11 year old boy. Good editing, I felt very bad for the San Bernardo. I would see it again if it were retransmitted, but the signal goes to Pluto as I write this. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I'm glad I did not live in THIS neighborhood. Oh those 70's. What decade If they remake it, I bet it would be very violent and bloody. So, what are you waiting for? An excellent movie for suburban pre-pubescent children. It was very intense. I think it was filmed in Los Angeles. Certainly not done in Lodi NJ. The photo with San Bernardo was the best and, obviously, the most disturbing image of the film ... and then they left the corpse in the portico. Rotten children
