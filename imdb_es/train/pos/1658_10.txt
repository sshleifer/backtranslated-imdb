If you've seen this movie, you've been to Puerto Rico. I have lived in Puerto Rico all my life and I have to admit shamefully that we (PR) are living in real chaos at this moment. Drugs are the main reason for the shootings and murders that we have almost every day. These people will shoot anyone, anytime and anywhere, and many innocent lives have been lost because of this. We no longer feel safe, and in addition to this, our so-called "justice" no longer moves by truth and righteousness, but by money, influence and power. "Thieves and Liars" is based on real and deplorable events, and truly portrays the three main problems of Puerto Rico: the murders related to drugs, money and power that manipulate our courtrooms, and innocent people and children corrupted and even dying because of this. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their realistic plot and award-winning address (**), were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, living a nightmare that does not seem to end! !! ** Recently won the "Copper Wing Award" for Best Director at the World Cinema Competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
