Huge, exhaustive and passionate summary of American cinema seen through the eyes of Martin Scorcese. It goes without saying that there is never a dull moment in all its 4 hours duration. Many genres, periods and directors are examined, they are discussed more from the point of view of the filmmaker instead of the contemporary director. For anyone who is even remotely interested in American movies, or in movies in general. A masterpiece, and the best of BFI's Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
