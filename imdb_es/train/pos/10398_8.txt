Although time has revealed how some of the effects were made, this story of love and adventure is still special. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie, you will be surprised how much it has been stolen. Later filmmakers. I was watching this with a friend who was surprised by the amount of Disney Aladdin that appeared in the movie. They loved the movie and they enjoyed that it was a touchstone for so many other films and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I have given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, which is where a good part of this film resides, because in the last 15 minutes the film collapses in rhythm. Everything rushes as if they have to suddenly arrive at the end. From the djinn's starting point to the end, it seems to be more of a sketch than a finished painting. It does not kill the movie, but it weakens it. <br /> <br /> Your visualization is still required for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie.
