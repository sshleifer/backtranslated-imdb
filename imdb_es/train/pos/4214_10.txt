The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One and this movie), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best movies in the world. Represents Fuller in its most controlled form. I like it when it's out of control, of course, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The movie is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark plays a pickpocket who steals a microfilm for communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who carried the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and retrieve it. She finds it through a pigeon stool played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to one another, which changes Peters' loyalties (that and the fact that he finds out that he is working for the Communists, Cold War things are really interesting). The love story is a bit quick and not entirely credible, but it's not bad enough to damage the movie (unlike Fuller's previous movie, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. This should be one of your best roles, but I am not so familiar with your career that I can say that for sure. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as moving as any she can find in the movies. I will never forget that. 10/10.
