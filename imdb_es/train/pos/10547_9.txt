I saw the trailer on the DVD after watching the movie, and I think anyone who has seen it before watching the movie would be surprised and possibly disappointed. He gave a lot of importance to the fact that the movie was "by Cube's director" and made it look like a horror movie, when in reality it's an absurd comedy (IMDB's spell-checker does not seem to think that Absurdist is a word, but what is), which reminds Rosencrantz and Guildernstern are Dead. <br /> <br /> I love the way the story slowly builds up at first, and then gradually increases. I also enjoy the fact that no explanation of what happens in the film is given. That and the fact that the story is developed mainly in a single set are the only aspects in which this movie is similar to Cube. I recommend it.
