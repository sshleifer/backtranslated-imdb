['In the early 1970s, many of us who had embraced the hippie / acid / alternative culture wholeheartedly, had realized that society in general was not going to change the way we thought. For me this movie defined the tension of &quot;now what?&quot; that many of the people I knew felt at that moment. Do we go to the commune and create our own vision of utopia or do we radicalize and promote change? <br /><br /> From the useless gestures to the police, the radical rhetoric, the music of Pink Floyd, to the creation of love and the explosive images in the desert, there is so much. It captures a significant moment in time well.']
