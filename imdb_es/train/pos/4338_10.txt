The movie was very moving. It was tender and fun at the same time. The landscape was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award-winning performances. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand that, due to the story line, his part had to be brief, but I would have liked to have seen it more. She is a true pro. You will be able to remember experiences of your own life, and hopefully in a positive way later. watching this movie We were lucky enough to see Paul Reiser in a Q and A after viewing. He is a wonderful, intelligent, eloquent man and a "real person". It really was a pleasant night. This is a movie that must be seen. You will be so grateful to have gone.
