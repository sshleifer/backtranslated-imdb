Simon Pegg plays a celebrity journalist who is brought from England to work in a large American magazine. Of course, their ways of winning create all kinds of complications. Fun comedy based on facts that is starring Kristen Dunst (with quite adult appearance), Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It works mainly because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We fully understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent mistakes. I liked the movie. It's not the beginning and the end, but it was a good way to end an afternoon of sitting on the couch watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
