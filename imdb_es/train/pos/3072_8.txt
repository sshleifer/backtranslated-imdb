Panic is a little gem of a movie: you think you'll have discovered it in the first half hour just to realize, with pleasure, that Henry Bromell is a writer / director much better than that. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds slowly, with one quietly devastating scene after another, all portrayed to perfection by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most notable child actor I've seen it for a long time, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who presents his lines as if they were completely unsprayed thoughts that were created in his mind. Rich and rewarding, this movie will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
