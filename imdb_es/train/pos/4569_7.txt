DANIEL DAY-LEWIS does an extraordinary job playing Christy Brown, the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have a productive life, deal successfully with her disability and become a respected artist and writer. <br /> <br /> The movie, however, is very difficult to review, or even to watch. Fortunately, I had the subtitle function to capture every spoken word that would have been impossible if I had seen the movie in a theater. Although I respect it as a brave work that deals with difficult issues, I can not say it's the kind of movie I'd like to see more than once. <br /> <br /> However, my attention remained. For the storytelling device, a flashback framed by the present, in which we see Christy being honored for her achievements before seeing the flashback of her youth and her struggles to communicate with those around her, who certainly gave her a loving attention DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is certainly remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), in the fear of his mother that when love does not correspond, her heart will break. There is a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love before others and then becomes angry after drinking too much. <br /> <br /> BRENDA FRICKER does a brilliant job as the caring mother, her father and a litter of brothers as they struggled to keep a roof over their heads until Day-Lewis starts to succeed with her work. She complements Day-Lewis's performance as the good-hearted mother and shares many touching moments with him. <br /> <br /> Richly detailed story of a family that stayed together in the most unusual circumstances with attention to the detail of the period in each frame of the film. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won the Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor is Christy as a child and McAnally is the father who spends too much time in the local pub but loves the child. <br /> <br /> In short: the music of Elmer Bernstein is a positive factor. It's worth it, but it's definitely not a movie for everyone.
