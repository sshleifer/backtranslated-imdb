I followed the trip two years ago on the Internet, now I've seen the movie! What trip! And what a trip to meet Darius Weems! Such a brave, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a crew! Listening to Darius laughing at being in the water in Panama City, seeing his concern about being too close to the alligators in Louisiana, the wonder in his eyes while traveling in a hot air balloon, the thrill of rafting in some rapids, the I bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and phone calls home, and as always, children will be children. This film should be seen by all, young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. They gave Darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility problems; they took Dar√≠o on the trip of his life; and they touched many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West: a cure for DMD.
