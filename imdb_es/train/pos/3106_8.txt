Having not seen the movies before (and not being able to support Matt Damon), I resisted going to see the Bourne Ultimatum when they asked us to watch them at AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon could be nice. <br /> <br /> Quick fight scenes, crazy motorcycle chases and BIG explosions were what knocked you out of your TBU seat. The nearby faults between the CIA and Bourne kept you alert and entertained. <br /> <br /> However, several things really scratched my cheese. <br /> <br /> First of all, the fact that the movie was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence became repetitive and finally boring. Although Damon kept us entertained and seemed to always be one step ahead of the CIA, it was bothering me a little with Bourne's constant survival. He hit a car and it came out as if he had hit him or something. Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> And in second place (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so unstable that it was completely perceptible and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) dizzy. The tutors told us that if we ever used it in a movie we did in class, it would automatically be wrong and they would tell us to use a tripod. Pretty much if Greengrass wanted us to look like we were there seeing Damon and Stiles talking, but surely we would not be shaking our heads so violently! <br /> <br /> But in general, TBU is a nice movie. And it's worth a watch. But I did not think it was the best movie of the year, despite being an entertaining film piece. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
