['My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, now he is on a Russian fishing boat and he said that the movie that impressed him the most and that has remained in his mind during these 39 years is the movie The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He asked me if it was possible for me to get this. I am sure that many things go through his head, since he has only 3 hours of daylight and has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood, it connects to this movie. On January 27 will be 47 years old and I would like to get this film for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and, as we all know, this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thanks in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL']
