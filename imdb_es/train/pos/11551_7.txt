['THE ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars) <br /><br /> Like most people, I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the ultimate &quot;strange couple&quot;. His incredible work in the television series from early to mid-70s was a high watermark for television at that time ... easily overcoming the stage and screen versions of the story. However, how can you make a mistake with a couple of Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau? Matthau is in an especially good shape as Oscar, the bum. Lemmon takes a little time to get used to Felix, especially if he&#39;s seen Tony Randall&#39;s extraordinary performance before. The script is good ... definitely the best of Neil Simon. (I will state here that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst dramatists in American theater with the highest rating). The story is simple: Felix, a clean monster and recently separated from his wife, moves in with Oscar. the bum who needs help to save money for alimony payments. Their life arrangements become very similar to a marriage, culminating in some fun tiffs and spats. Lots of fun and some great of a single line.']
