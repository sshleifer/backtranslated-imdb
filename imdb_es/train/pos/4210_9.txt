I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were top-notch, including the most important, for me anyway, the script and the acting. This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is totally convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could have tackled this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work that I can remember. She impressed so much here that I will definitely be in search of her other job. Thelma Ritter, in an unattractive role, deserved the Oscar nomination she received for playing the informant. This movie works on all levels. Black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and history engages the viewer from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. Highly recommended, 9/10.
