['I&#39;ve seen The Running Man several times because I&#39;m a fan of Stephen King and I have all his movies, but now it&#39;s even better because until 2 days ago I did not know anything about this website and I did not realize that Paul Michael Glaser who participated in this movie was the same Paul Michael Glaser that I grew up watching on the television show Starsky and Hutch. For me this is a pleasant surprise because I can not tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt. The episode in which Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died, I cried so much that my father had to get away from the show. What do you expect from a child at 12 years old? Now, I&#39;m intentionally looking for movies and shows that include Paul or David Soul and whatever Stephen King has in his hands. I just have to say Happy birthday Paul!']
