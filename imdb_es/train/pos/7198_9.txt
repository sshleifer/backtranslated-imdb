This is a really good movie and one that I have enjoyed watching several times. Michael Caine is amazing as always. Michael Caine has received a kind of reputation for taking on any role in any film regardless of the quality or lack thereof, but he plays a good role in playing Sidney. From the beginning it is so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such creepy things as The Boys from Brazil and Rosemary's Baby, could write something so witty? Let's face it: Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to go wrong with such a good cast led by Sidney Lumet? <br /> <br /> I am very reluctant to go because if someone gave something about this movie it would be a crime. Just look at it and love it.
