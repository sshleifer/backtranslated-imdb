I enjoyed this movie very much. Many Koreans will be familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school. The cinematography was normal. The film would have been better if the angel or camera movement were more irregular. However, the edition was very clear and unusual. <br /> <br /> The performance was also very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent and weak girl in Korean telenovelas. But this time, she plays a cute tomboy very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his very credible role. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this movie is that the emotion of the characters is not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romantic movies that the characters are crying on the river before the audience and I always thought it was very old. There was no such shit in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well done.
