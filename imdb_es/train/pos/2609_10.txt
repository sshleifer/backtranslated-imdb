I am writing this 9 years after the final episode aired and I am still recovering from the impact that Wildside has had on me. <br /> <br /> It has gone where many other police dramas have been successful. But it took it further and did not depart from the realism of the streets, often portraying events and characters from life up to a T. <br /> <br /> I miss this series a lot, instead, we have been given the stupid "Underbelly", which is more dramatized and acted on, creating a full load of American garbage. <br /> <br /> Wildside remained true to the uniqueness of Sydney and that's why I'm really in debt to this wonderful series. The performance was grade A and it is a shame to see that only a few actors have improved their career, while others have vanished in the dark. <br /> <br /> I do not want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of its television history. That's why I'm asking ABC to release the entire series on DVD, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
