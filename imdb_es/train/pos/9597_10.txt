['This is a must-see documentary film for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost their taste for the adventure of real life and their sense of morality. Darius Goes West is an incredible roller coaster of a story. We live the lives of Darius and the crew as they embark on the journey of his life. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a disease that affects every muscle in his body. He is confined to a wheelchair and needs constant attention. So, how is it possible that this group of young friends managed to take him on a 6,000-mile round trip to the west coast and back? Watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure: laugh and cry with the crew as you face unimaginable challenges along the way, and enjoy the ultimate triumph when you return three weeks later to your hometown for an enthusiastic reception. And some great surprises!']
