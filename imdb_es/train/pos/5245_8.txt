I thought this movie was fucking fun. It's a funny movie, which should not be taken seriously, about the twisted opinions of a man about life, love and ... well, ladies "from the humble ski bus station, to the debutante upper class ... bus station skank ". Tim Meadows plays a boy (Leon Phelps) who was raised in a playboy mansion by a father figure of Hugh Hefner-esquire, constantly surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his "father" throws him on the street, he must learn to fend for himself with nothing but the chauvinistic vision of life that his youth has taught him ... that and a level of unfathomable charm, almost mystical and silly luck . And so the hijinx begin! If you have not seen this movie and you enjoy a comedy / love story, carefree and carefree, then I highly recommend renting "the Man of the Ladies".
