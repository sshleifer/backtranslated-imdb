['Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, but it is often compared to Walt Disney. That is so unfair, because it is seen by watching Miyazaki&#39;s films that he is the superior artist. He really has the gift of thrilling both adults and children, and Laputa is, in fact, an incredible journey. <br /><br /> But where can I begin to describe such a magical and impressive film! Miyazaki&#39;s works have never ceased to amaze me. Laputa is a large-scale adventure and I wonder how a movie can be so full of details and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child who dreams of such a great and magical adventure, what would it be like? The answer would be to tie oneself in some seat and look at Laputa, because it is really a fantasy of childhood come true. Every minute of the film is rich and fascinating ... from the train chase to the incredible aerial flight sequences ... and the wonderful view of the floating castle. Not to mention Joe Hisaishi&#39;s excellent score! Everything you possibly want from an adventure movie is here.']
