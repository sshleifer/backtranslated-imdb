I really can not remember who recommended it, but they said it was one of his favorite movies. It's certainly a stranger, like making a trap in a traffic accident. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the truth is stranger than fiction, and that the truth here is something to see. I really can not understand how a fictional story of this documentary will be published this year. How can you improve this? Aunt and Jackie Kennedy's cousin retire from the New York Society and hide in Hampton's. In the process, they become inmates and what is best described as "crazy cat ladies". They would have remained hidden if the city had not acted to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue of Jackie. This movie was made after that rescue. During all the time, you could not help but think: "how bad was it before?" It's a look at high society from the darkest side, and it's absolutely fascinating.
