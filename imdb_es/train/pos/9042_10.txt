I think I read this somewhere: Joe Johnston (director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic to work on the first Star Wars movie) and one of their producers or something like that was risking their brains for A title for The Movie, "Rocket Boys" (I suppose) was missing something. <br /> <br /> One day they were playing with a PC program that forms words from other words (that is, writes a word or a series of words). and mix the letters and form other words) I think the technical term is an "anagram" <br /> <br /> Anyway, they wrote "Rocket Boys" and, of course, what comes back is "October Sky" . They were surprised to say the least. The title summed up everything in the film since the film revolves around Sputnik. At first, Homer Jr. did not like the idea, but was encouraged after "the paperback novel of a movie poster" appeared and took off.
