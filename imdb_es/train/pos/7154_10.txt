I discovered about the movie "Holes" by hearing from people who were not the typical Disney, that both children and adults were involved in the story. Friends, let me tell you that I was not disappointed. "Holes" is based on the novel by Louis Sachar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who is sent to a strange field of juvenile detention in the desert. He befriends a boy nicknamed Zero and together they embark on an adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting story, unique, different and fun. I did not really know what to expect when I saw it. It was interesting to see how the story came together like pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played with the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and Jon Voight was as funny as Mr. Sir. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. The most recommended!
