Allen and Julie move to a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is killed one night. Nobody knows who killed the girl, but that's why they moved to the mountains. So the couple moves to this cabin and is tormented by people who committed suicide there and nobody in the nearby town wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of chills and it has a lot of parts that made me jump. Some of the parts are predictable, but from time to time there is a part that I did not expect. It was a pretty good movie that was not the most terrifying movie in the world, but I still had the fear of doing it pretty well. <br /> <br /> I also liked the ending because it let the viewer decide how to do it. It's also a kind of sad movie, but a well-made horror movie.
