This may not be one of the best films ever made, but in general it is a very nice and cheerful piece of foam in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time. Highly recommended for your feeling of feeling good alone. Granted, Frank Sinatra's "performance" leaves a lot to be desired, but his singing is an excellent feature and the songs fit perfectly into the romantic mood of the film. Sinatra continued making many more films in which her undoubted capacity for acting shone, but in this, her first foray into Hollywood, her voice, not her acting, is her main contribution to this film. I just watched it on TV again and it still raises my mood as much as it did the first time I saw it many years ago.
