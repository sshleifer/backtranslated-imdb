In complete contrast to the opinions of the other reviewer, this movie was actually surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see him and hoped to get bored with clich√©s, obvious jokes and overreactions, all of which the trailer had promised. <br /> <br /> However, after 5 minutes I found myself really laughing and enjoying the refreshing interim. With only a gag of "toilet humor", Over Her Dead Body manages to create really fun scenarios and, without spoiling too much, some of the moments involving animals are fun. <br /> <br /> The basic ingredients of a good movie are all there; Screenplay, director and actors, and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands out. <br /> <br /> Sure, you will not learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind, you will most likely have a good time!
