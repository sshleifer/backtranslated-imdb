['I thought this was a wonderful movie. Touch every fiber of a human being. The love in the movie is very intense. I thought it was Will&#39;s best performance to date. Great address I liked the edition. The music was great. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie that everyone should see. I hope that people get something wonderful from this. In general, excellent movie. I think Hollywood should do more movies with substance. Even action movies can have a loving history. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his performance. He had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see. I would suggest seeing this alone or with someone who really cares about you. For me, I found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film. The outside world was suspended for a moment. It was a nice feeling with all this chaos that is happening in this world. And with this generation, it was great to see something (someone) who cared about other people more than himself.']
