Made in the same year as "Vertigo", this is an equally haunting movie, although in a much lighter tone. It is set in an enchanted New York during the winter: Kim Novak is a witch who casts a spell on James Stewart, but instead gets trapped. The interesting thing is that the rival of Novak is played by Janice Rule, who originated the role of Madge in "Picnic" on Broadway (the role that Novak would make famous in the film).
