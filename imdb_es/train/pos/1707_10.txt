This movie is not for everyone. Either you are bright enough to get "that" or you are not. Fans of sci-fi movies that do not take themselves too seriously will definitely enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie for those who can appreciate skits and parodies. Everyone I have recommended this movie has enjoyed it. If you like Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you will probably enjoy this one. The characterizations of the voices are carried out in an ironic way and the phrases of a single flight fly fast and furious.
