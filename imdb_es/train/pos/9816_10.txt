The outrage is pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the role! It's hard to believe that this is a true story, but what can you do? When I saw this, I thought about why they had to do all those things. It's not right, but they learned the lesson when they chose the wrong man! Anyway, if you ever watch this movie on TV, watch it because it's a good one!
