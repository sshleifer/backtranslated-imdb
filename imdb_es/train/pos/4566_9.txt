Daniel Day-Lewis is Christy Brown, a victim of cerebral palsy who uses "My Left Foot" to write and paint in this incredible 1989 film. The film also stars Brenda Fricker as Christy's mother, Ray McAnally, Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Conor. His brilliant performances, great screenplay and wonderful direction by Jim Sheridan help paint a vivid portrait of Christy Brown, an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49. <br /> <br /> Brown was born into a middle-class Catholic family where his mother was constantly pregnant (22 children in total, 13 of whom survived). His father considered Christy mentally retarded and physically disabled, but he did not allow his son to enter a house. The children of the family said goodbye to him every day while they went to school, and then his mother fed him and talked to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Fricker conveys the meaning of a woman. who, despite being surrounded by a large family, needs someone to talk to. Christy does not answer. Finally, there is a cart for him to travel, and the children of the neighborhood, all those who know him since he was a baby, include him in all his activities. The only part of his body that works really well is his left foot, and when the kids discover how well he kicks, they put him in football games for that purpose. One of the most enjoyable parts of the movie is the relaxed way in which the other children treat it. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but none as powerful as Christy writing "Mother" on the floor holding a piece of chalk between her fingers. "He's a real Brown," his father declares, lifting him onto his shoulders and taking him to the pub. Upon entering the pub, he announces: "My son is a genius". Things change when Christy gets older because she has the wishes and emotions of a child. He develops crushes, is rejected and goes deeper into himself, resorting to painting. Finally, enter therapy at a nearby clinic and work with a therapist, Eileen (Fiona Shaw) at home. He falls in love with her. When she finds out that she is engaged, she almost goes crazy. But he survives to live, paint, write (three books in total) and love again. <br /> <br /> Because it is a movie, by necessity they had to put aside some things and combine the characters. Brown was not really diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time, which was left out of the movie. The Eileen therapist is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in Christy's life, and although we know that her mother believed she had a good mind, in truth, she worked very hard with Christy as a child and taught her the alphabet, etc. . In addition, before Mary, Christy had a 12-year relationship with the woman to whom he dedicated "My left foot". And the typical Hollywood ending, 9 years before his death, where his wife's negligence may have been a factor, does not end the story. <br /> <br /> Despite all that, the biography of Christy Brown is incredibly powerful, all the more so because of two performances: Hugh O'Conor as the young Christy and Daniel Day-Lewis as the adult Christy. O'Conor's facial expression and the way he drags his deformed body is heartbreaking. One is exhausted for him and with a broken heart at the same time. <br /> <br /> And what can be said about Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the best actors in the world, gives life to Christy, a totally carnal character. Outside, an intelligent human being able to swear, become angry, bitter, drunk, aggressive, lustful, fun and loving. A well-deserved Oscar won the same year that Tom Cruise was nominated for "Born on the Fourth of July." I remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that Cruise was so sensational, what was wrong with the Academy? Uh, nothing for a change. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker is amazing as Christy's mother, who never stops believing in him and what he can do and who holds his family and husband together during difficult times. The wonderful thing about Fricker's performance is that support, love and a work ethic seem to be natural for the mother. The character would never consider himself a heroine or someone who does something out of the ordinary. Fricker shows us a religious but not a fanatical woman who believes that her duties on earth are to be a good wife and a good mother. And no matter what, even when her husband is out of work, he expels his daughter from the house because she is pregnant, whatever it is, she manages. He saves money for Christy's wheelchair, receives photos of his daughter and baby, begins to build a room for Christy in the back of the house. All part of the day's work. A performance worthy of the Oscar he received. <br /> <br /> Brown's life was more complicated than this inspiring movie, but this is an incredible achievement for everyone involved and a must-see.
