CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) dies shortly after learning she is pregnant. Then we see the husband in heaven letting the powers know that he was taken away too soon and that his wife needs him. He is told that he can return to earth but not like himself. Flashforward 19 years in which we see the daughter of Shepherd (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing to graduate from college and finding a young man (Robert Downey Jr.) who, apparently, is the reincarnation of his father. The movie is a little on the predictable side ... the story goes to all the places you expect, but it's played so charmingly by an energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can not help but get caught up in the fun. Shepherd has rarely been seen on the screen for a better advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles. A charming and charming fantasy that will envelop you and you will love it.
