As of this writing, John Carpenter's 'Halloween' is approaching its 30th anniversary. Since then, it has generated 7 sequels, a remake, a lot of imitations and every year around Halloween when they make those lists of 'The 10 most terrifying movies', it's always there. That's pretty amazing for a movie that was made with a budget of around $ 300,000 and had an almost completely unknown cast of promising youngsters. I could go on and on, but the big question here is: How do you hold the movie today? And all I can say to that is, fantastically! <br /> <br /> Pros: A simple but spooky opening sequence of credits that really sets the mood. An unforgettable and incomparable score by the director / co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinematography The stellar direction of Carpenter, who keeps the suspense high, receives some great shots and takes care not to show too much to his villain. Good performances of the then mostly unknown cast. A good sense of humor. Michael Myers is a fearsome and evil guy. Many strange moments that will stay with you. The pace is slow, but constant and never dragging. Unlike most of the other Slasher movies, this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a great body count. <br /> <br /> Cons: Probably not as scary now as it was then. Many of the fools really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I want to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite movie of the series. I know it's not a popular opinion, but it's really how I feel. In spite of that, it really is an important film that continues to reach new generations of moviegoers. And just because it has been redone for a new generation does not mean it will be forgotten. No way, not how. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
