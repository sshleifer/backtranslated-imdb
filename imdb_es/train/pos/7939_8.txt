It's good to have a movie that the whole family can watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who marries in Las Vegas on a whim and then not only have to give the news to their children, but also try to merge their respective households (each has two boys and two girls) in a cohesive family unit. What happens when the group, which includes four teenagers, two pre-teens and two younger children, asks at first if there can ever be true happiness for Carrie and Jim. The fights between the children (and a small love story between two of them) make you wonder if everyone can ever get along. More interesting than the Brady Bunch, this is a totally pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
