Firearms, buildings exploding, cars crashing, and that's only the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action-packed film that involves a dishonest CIA mercenary who can not seem to die no matter how many times he gets shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> The hard and toothy Gary Busey, usually chosen as a villain in these movies a little, has his usual crazy charm, but it's a bit more subdued: after all, he carries the whole show. Which does not mean there are not many excellent supporting roles, like William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala and several other "forgotten" characters. <br /> <br /> There are enough smaller action sequences to sustain the whole story: Busey has to free a group of "kidnapped" US military elites and return a high-tech "supertank" (a normal tank with a cheesy add-in stuck on the top) back to the states. <br /> <br /> But America deserves this machine to kill more than the bad guys? This question is asked, of course, as in any film focused on the CIA ... but without preaching.
