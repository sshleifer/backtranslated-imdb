This interesting Giallo drives a typical but still exciting plot and a really sadistic killer who obviously likes to hunt his victims before murdering them in bloody ways. <br /> <br /> Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia who, a year before, also made the very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment about it), the film starts a little slow, but in general, no time is lost with subplots or unnecessary sequences. <br /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian coproduction, but it was released in Germany in video only in a version cut by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title "Horror House". At least the murder scenes, which will satisfy all the gorehounds, are totally intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end. But the Italian version that contains all the images is still the one to look for, of course. <br /> <br /> A convincing Giallo with obligatory turns and false clues, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is highly recommended for Giallo. Fans and slightly higher than the other Miraglia thriller.
