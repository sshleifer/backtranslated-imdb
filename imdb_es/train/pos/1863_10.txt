ANTWONE FISHER is the story of a young Navy sailor with emotional problems. His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him to realize that his problems stem from his early childhood education. <br /> <br /> Prepare to shed a tear or two. The movie could defrost the coldest heart. I loved the story, which turns from something so terrible that it happens to anyone in a positive ending. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful film, the most important thing about forgiveness. Other important issues that make you think are child abuse, adoption and foster care. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner Denzel Washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut. There were many scenes that I enjoyed watching. They included the beginning (the dreams of a little boy? Take a look at the gigantic pancakes!) And the end (the dreams came true), which beautifully united the story. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged Antwone to look for his family to find answers to his questions about the family that left him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and his reaction towards him. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All the actors represented their parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to director responsibilities, Mr. Washington continues to demonstrate why he won an Oscar award and succeeds in all of his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this movie. <br /> <br /> The actor, Derek Luke showed why he was so good for the role of Antwone Fisher. He portrayed a very real and moving work. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant, who played Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, looked like a ray of sunlight on the screen. Chemistry flowed well between romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who played the role of Mrs. Tate, a despicable character, deserves a special mention. <br /> <br /> Although we only see her for a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother had an excellent performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
