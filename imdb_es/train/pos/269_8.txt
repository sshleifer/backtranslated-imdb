I am a fan of television movies in general and this was one of the good ones. The performances of the cast were quite solid and there were turns that I did not see before each announcement. For me, it was like Medium meets CSI. <br /> <br /> Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I would definitely see it again or rent it out if it was a video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. I have not seen her in many things and she did her job very convincingly. <br /> <br /> If you like TV mystery movies, look at this if you have a chance.
