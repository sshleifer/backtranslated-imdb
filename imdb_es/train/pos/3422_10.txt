I need it desperately on a tape, not on a DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> I have a nephew who is in the infantry but has not yet deployed, although he set out to go to Iraq shortly after December 2008. I lost my beloved stepson in Ramadi Iraq on September 15 2005 of an unmanned missile in a green area. I have another nephew who joins the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because he, like his older brother, has an idealized and romantic idea of ​​what it is to serve in the military. My stepson died after only 10 days in the country and never went on any mission, so my nephews have no way of referring to any of the experiences shown in this frank documentary of any personal experiences that may have been transmitted by my deceased son. . <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can do with those who are or have left, but I have one who has not raised his hand and has sworn STILL. I desperately want him to be informed, none of the others did. <br /> <br /> Please help me with this. <br /> <br /> The documentary film The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I have. never seen. I have to make my youngest nephew see what he's getting himself into before it's too late. BUT: (do not laugh) I NEED my mother to see this first. She really must see and listen to these men and women, not just the idea of ​​them, but the truth of what they will be immersed in, possibly forever. Then she will have the emotional determination to make my brother see this movie and, once he has it, he can have his son, my youngest nephew, see it too. Then, my nephew could start taking this seriously. <br /> <br /> ((Is there another time that it shows on TV, if so, tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> However, my problem is that my mother if she does not own a DVD player, she still uses video (is that correct? With tapes?) Therefore, I need to find a way for her to watch this movie. Can I buy this from someone in that way? If not, is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a tape from someone? Is there a legitimate link from which I can pay to download it to my computer and then transfer it to a tape? If so, with whom would I get in touch? I will gladly pay the privilege provided it is a legitimate link. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have any alternative ideas, I will consider anything you can suggest. <br /> <br /> Please, help me, I have already lost a very dear and dearly loved person, I know that my oldest nephew will never be the same when he returns and I can lose him too. I can not lose three and the emotional cost for all those who do is a price too high to pay for every male child of my family of that generation. Please help. I will gladly call you, send me an email to a number if it is the best way to obtain the necessary information. Thank you very much for any help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
