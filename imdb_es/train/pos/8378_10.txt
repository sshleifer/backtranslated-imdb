What a great movie it is. The idea that nations send people fighting each other with giant robots is in bad taste. The end is not only appropriate, it is more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But the characters intrigue me. It is a pity that we never see the relationship between Achilles and Athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and the fear of Athena for the safety of Achilles. Your romance is very nice. <br /> <br />
