I had the opportunity to see this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, where he won a Best Film award. This movie is brilliantly done, with an excellent cast that works well as a whole. My favorite performances were Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. Also, there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches, which surprised me to discover that this movie was made with a small budget. The writer and director Adam Jones, who I think also won a prize for his writing, does an excellent job with management. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie. You definitely have to see it.
