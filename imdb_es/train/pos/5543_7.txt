Horror film very well made and creepy of the film company of the line of poverty, PRC, which often publish very tacky movies like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT. The German expatriate director Wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his set of marshes for study. Gaunt and the macabre Charles Middleton is effective as the strangler.
