I saw this in Detroit in what must have been his original career. I literally rolled in the theater hall. It was that funny. I have not seen it since, but I would love it. Where do you get a copy? Anyone who says anything about the fact that it is dated or exaggerated is, for my money, only a handful of people. Each parody is hilarious, erotic or perversely perverse. Each! There is no weak one included. The opening sequence, for example, parodies of 2001, presents go-go-dancers with hanging breasts. Felinni would have filmed it if he had the evil wit ... If you come to this movie with an open mind and a cheerfully mocking heart, you will include it in your best list.
