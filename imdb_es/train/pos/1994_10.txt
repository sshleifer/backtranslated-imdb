['OLIVER TWIST was to have controversy and success after Dickens published it in 1837. His image of life in the urban ghettos was something surprising and new, and his creation in the central figures of the novel included criminals was another innovation. <br /><br /> One day he was walking through London and crossing paths with a young woman with whom he had been friends. He said hello, but she was pretty rigid with him. He could not understand this. A few days later they met again and he asked her what he had done to upset her. &quot;Well, if you must know, I did not like your latest novel,&quot; he said. &quot;Really, everyone else thinks very well.&quot; I was baffled: &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; &quot;Oh, Charles,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m Jewish, how can you invent a character like Fagin?&quot; I did not expect this: &quot;Well ... you know last year&#39;s trial of Ikey Solomon, the thieves&#39; trainer, he&#39;s a model for Fagin and he was a Jew.&quot; <br /><br /> Dickens found that did not solve things. &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, &quot;she got what she deserved, but Charles, they did not call him&quot; the Jewish Solomon, &quot;as you call Fagin&quot; the Jew! &quot;Also, Solomon did not plan a murder, Fagin does.&quot; Dickens had to admit that he could have been carried away. He left thinking about what she said. <br /><br /> Oliver Twist was published in several editions. Dickens tried to improve Fagin a bit. Then he had an idea. He reworked the chapter called &quot;Fagin&#39;s Last Night of Life,&quot; showing the fears in the man as he faced suspension. He also added some additional details. <br /><br /> She let her friend know about her decision to change Fagin. A day later, later, he met her at a friend&#39;s house. She looked at him like he was crazy. &quot;Did not you like the changes?&quot; He asked. &quot;Charles, what&#39;s changing? He&#39;s still a vile villain called&quot; the Jew &quot;!&quot; She replied. &quot;Yes, I kept that, but you did not see how scared I was in the cell of death in prison.&quot; The young woman had realized this, but she felt that she was so vile that she deserved to suffer such fears. &quot;Ah ... so I was right about that ... and did you see the little details I added?&quot; He asked. &quot;What details?&quot; She replied. &quot;When you see Fagin for the first time, he is cooking dinner himself ... did you read that?&quot; Dickens looked at her for a sign of recognition. Instead, the lady seemed confused. &quot;I read that I was by the fireplace, but I should have looked through the passage.&quot; Dickens smiled brightly, &quot;He&#39;s cooking a pork sausage for his dinner.&quot; &quot;A what!&quot; She exclaimed. &quot;He&#39;s eating pork, dear ... look, he&#39;s not a good Jew!&quot; His friend looked at him, shook his head and, to his dismay, left his friend&#39;s house. She did not talk to him for years. <br /><br /> Dickens never completely got rid of his fanaticisms, but the situation led to a partial attempt to amend his last complete novel. In OUR FRIEND MUTUO (1865) he has a secondary character, Mr. Riah, who is used by an unscrupulous owner to collect high incomes from poor tenants. The owner believes that Mr. Riah will be blamed because he is Jewish. <br /><br /> But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very, very, very, very good man, so good to be amazing. If Fagin saw Mr. Riah in action, he would probably chase him away with a stick. <br /><br /> The anti-Semitic image of Fagin endures to this day. It is a measure of Dickens&#39;s genius as a writer that the novel overcomes him. However, when presenting the story in a film, it still causes problems for screenwriters and directors: how, after the Holocaust, can a cinematic treatment of a worthy novel be made without inflaming fanaticism? David Lean showed how Alec Guiness appears in one or two scenes showing a human side and confronting a crowd at the end with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed, in his musical version of the novel, did it even better, due to a rewrite in the script of the original musical. <br /><br /> OLIVER became a musical success of the West End in the mid-1960s, and was then taken to Broadway, where it was once again a success. With a wonderful Lionel Bart score, which includes &quot;Glorious food&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m reviewing the situation&quot;, &quot;Consider yourself&quot;, &quot;Boy on sale&quot;, &quot;Who will buy&quot;, &quot;As long as he needs me&quot;, he deserved his success . Reed did well in performing his roles, including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sykes, Ron Moody as Fagin, Mark Lester as Oliver, Jack Wild as Dodger, Shani Wallis as Nancy and Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble. There had been no great musical successes in Hollywood for a decade: the last musical that won the Oscar for Best Film was GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968. <br /><br /> And Fagin, how to handle the eternal problem of the caricature? Well, in the musical Fagin is not captured, tried and executed for the murder that is committed. After all, even Lean showed that Fagin tried to control his partner in his actions. But here Fagin realizes that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of capricious life. Although he loses his treasures (those stolen items that he kept because he knew their value and admired her beauty), he decides that he can reform himself. He is allowed to do so, accompanied by his faithful acolyte, the Artful Dodger. I do not think Dickens would have appreciated the change (his friend could have done it), but a modern audience certainly accepts it as appropriate.']
