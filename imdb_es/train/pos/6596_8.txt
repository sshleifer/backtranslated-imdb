Brazilian films often get more positive ratings than they really deserve. Rather unbelievably, Against Everybody (original title, which the producers discarded: God Against Everybody) obtained a very low GPA (average grade) on this website. It seems to be rejected bluntly by the spectators in general. Actually, it's not that brutal. I refer to graphic violence. Its brutality is intrinsic, since it portrays the possible lumpens, I mean the helpless citizens who in fact have high technology equipment, who coldly carry out assassination orders in exchange for "grana graúda". Is this postmodern man? Is your only concern a quick, almost impersonal, ultra permissive posture in the midst of satisfying meals? The photo is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004, until now. Its brilliant style of editing, à la Godard, its curious counterpoints of soundtracks, its more than efficient distribution and, above all, its original narration, with subtle non-chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue, deserve at least an 8 mark.
