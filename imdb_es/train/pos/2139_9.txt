I approached this movie with few expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and far exceeds the ballroom dance films of recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While the music is nice and the dance colorful, for me the film is not about dancing. It is the same Japanese institution that provides male office workers with long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the whole family and the great mortgage and an enthusiasm for life. He is attracted by the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio that happens during his trip and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. It is also Japanese that the lustful motives that started his new passion become clear but somehow they are accepted, at least eventually, by the family and the audience. Attitudes toward ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-Western, although discipline and music are clearly important for Japan. Cultural contrasts are therefore intriguing. Even without the cultural ideas, the color, the dancing and the enthusiasm of the players make this a fun movie to watch.
