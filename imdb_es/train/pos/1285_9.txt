The frustrated middle-aged district attorney, George Maxwell (an excellent performance by George E. Carey, who also produced this movie) can no longer stand his frightful and frigid wife Edith (an Anne Bellamy, a perfect bitch). Worse yet, poor George is even more burdened with the sun of a newborn baby and a lascivious lesbian teen daughter (the very dark Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous adventure with the charming and seductive hippie babysitter who swings Candy Wilson (delightfully played with a sexy aplomb by the delicious blonde who defeats Patricia Wymer). Complications occur when George is blackmailed by the bitter Julia Freeman (a very poisonous twist of Kathy Williams), who wants George to take out his psychotic boyfriend the motorcyclist Laurence Mackey (a fearsome Robert Tessier, who has a head full of hair) . jail. Director Tom Laughlin (yes, the same guy who played Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McLarty cram the splendidly seaworthy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, soft and violent sex. In addition, they link precisely to all the wild and uninhibited sensitivity of the youth culture of the 60s and relate the plot in a short execution time of 75 minutes, which ensures that this film does not stay too long in your welcome. A definitive climax occurs when Candy invites her wonderful friends to Maxwell's house for an impromptu basement party, which includes smoking marijuana, rock music and, of course, hot, naked girls. The funky score of Robert O. Ragland hits the twisted place. The black and white cinematography of Stanton Fox adds an extra touch of sand to deliriously sordid events. Best of all, this movie qualifies as a wonderful showcase for the charming and sweet pixie Patricia Wymer, who positively illuminates the screen with her sweet and bubbly personality and captivating beauty. A total garbage treatment.
