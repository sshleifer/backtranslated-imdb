A fun and sweet story of 2 people who cross paths while preparing for their weddings. The former police writer and the public school teacher fall in love on this great New York stage, even though they are marrying other people. Maybe a little trite in the sense that the "partners" are type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. It's not heavy, but it made me smile. And, hey for the boys, sell the angle of Natasha Henstridge and the girls, sell them the romance, everyone wins!
