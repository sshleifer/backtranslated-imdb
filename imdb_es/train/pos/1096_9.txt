The first time I saw this movie in 1980 was at the midday spot. After many subsequent visualizations (and the purchase of the video) it still makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a relic of another era, a domestic comedy set in the middle class of the United States, but well executed is well executed. But it is also a document of its time: a celebration of post-war optimism, the baby boom and the age of nascent consumers. This movie is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three wonderful and sophisticated actors: the urban Melvyn Douglas; puzzled Cary Grant; Myrna Loy, decided by the fraud, complement each other and with a team of memorable characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes: "It means we have to explode" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little pig". <br /> <br /> I love it.
