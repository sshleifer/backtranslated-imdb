A series of super comedy from the 1990s (two series were made in total) that suffered in the ratings of the United Kingdom due to bad programming. When you face established comedies like 'Minder', even the best new comedies will fight to be noticed. <br /> <br /> Luckily, I captured the episode one episode and followed it avidly. I mentioned it to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to have been watching something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I loved both series and I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> Then I searched the Internet and discovered that an ultra fan was trying to get both series released "on their own". <br /> <br /> Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
