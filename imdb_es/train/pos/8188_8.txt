I really enjoyed the first part of this parter, The Impossible Planet, and I worried a bit that the second part did not stay as well as it has been in the past of the two parters of the last series of 2 Who. But fortunately, my fears were unfounded since I was enjoying this episode as much as the previous one. Anyway, we start with the surviving crew members of the Ood race, who have become the Devil's pawn. There is also a bit of philosophy about the part of the Doctor in the episode that I enjoyed a lot. Needless to say, it was a good and solid story of Doctor Who. Although it could be a bit too intense for younger viewers. <br /> <br /> My rating: B +
