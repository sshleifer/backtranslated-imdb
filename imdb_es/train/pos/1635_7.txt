In my high school days in Salina Kansas, they filmed something locally called "The Brave Young Men Of Weinberg" locally, and the film crews were quite prominent for weeks. finally, we found out that the movie was "Up The Academy", and it was a bit ummm, "he frowned" at what we were led to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see it, since it was there, and the local audience was not very satisfied with the presentation. I was 17 years old and I thought it was a rather ingenious attempt to make an "Animal house" comedy, even the fart jokes. <br /> <br /> I looked at it many times since then, and my opinion has softened a bit. It's silly, but sometimes it captures a little of the "angry" magazine humor, at least as well as most "angry TV". Ron Liebman might hate it, but it's almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on Santa Fe Avenue, where I had parked my car, while I was buying some guitar strings. Pity that the brief appearance of my Pinto, usually seems cut for television. I have not seen the new DVD, but if my old paint is visible, they have a sale.
