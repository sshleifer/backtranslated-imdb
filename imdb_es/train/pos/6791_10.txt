I support the motion to turn this into a movie, it would be great! I was also surprised by the history and character of this game. I've played it over and over again (more than 20 times) just to try something different and it's getting more interesting every time. Final Fantasy eat your heart out !! THIS MUST BE ON A MOVIE !!!!! If someone wants help to start a petition to turn this into a movie, contact me. I would love to help with that project any day. The graphics are great for PS1 and they even make you forget that PS1 is most of the time. The multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play.
