A pleasant surprise! I expected a new low along the line: The Rock (9) -> With Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an exaggerated film. Perhaps that is the reason why so few approved this new type of Bruckheimer rate. Intelligent dialogue instead of quick phrases, decent background / motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came, you really wanted to do it. Fanboys waiting for a roller coaster of Armageddon: stay away. This is one of the smartest action fans. It did not even bother me that Jolie showed up so little.
