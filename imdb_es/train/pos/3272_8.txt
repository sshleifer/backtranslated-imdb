['Coming from the same director who had made &quot;Candyman&quot; and &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;, I&#39;m not surprised it&#39;s a good movie. Ironically, &quot;Papierhaus&quot; is a film that I had never heard of before, however, it must be one of the best films of the late 80s, partly because it is the worst film period of recent decades. (It&#39;s not about Iranian or Swedish &quot;movies&quot; here ...) The performance is not brilliant, but simply solid, unlike what some claim here (they must have dreamed this &quot;wonderful performance&quot;, like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in an intelligent way that unites all the loose ends together. These unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose, leaving them in the interpretation of the individual, and there is nothing wrong with that with a topic like this. &quot;Pepperhaus&quot; is a somewhat unusual mixture of children&#39;s cinema and horror, with an effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your girl socially marginalized, shy, shy, clich√©, typical of the movie, but a normal and normal girl; very refreshing I&#39;m tired and tired of writers projecting their own childhoods similar to misfits in their books and on the screens, as if someone cared to look or read about another miserable and lonely childhood, as if that were all or as if of that kind Character background has a monopoly on good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy &quot;kissing&quot; (for quite some time) was a little too big: it evoked feelings of vague disgust and amusement, considering that he was only 11 years old, but as expected, Burke had 13 or more years. 14 when this was filmed. I have no idea why they did not improve the character&#39;s age or did not get a younger actress. It was pretty obvious that Burke is not that young. Why directors always make children older than what they play, therefore, dilute realism, I&#39;ll never know']
