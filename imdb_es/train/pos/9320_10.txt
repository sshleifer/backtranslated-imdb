A brief theme of MGM MINIATURE. <br /> <br /> The editor of Cole County Clarion must decide what is the real IMPORTANT NOTICE for its readers: an imminent frost that can mean a disaster for their crops, or the sensational collapse of a notorious gangster in the main street from his small town. <br /> <br /> This is a nice little carrousel, which presents a good presentation of the comic Charles `Chic 'Sale. Viewers today may be more interested in the appearance of the uncredited James Stewart, as nephew / assistant to Sale. Speaking slowly and somewhat ridiculously, Stewart shows many of the attributes that would make him a great star in a very short time. <br /> <br /> Often, overlooked or neglected today, short one- and two-reel themes were useful for studies as important training camps for new or growing talents, both in front of and behind the camera. The dynamics to create a successful short track was completely different from that of a feature film, something like writing a short story in the first category instead of a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and schedules and able to portray a wide range of materials, the short subjects were the perfect complement for the feature films of the studios.
