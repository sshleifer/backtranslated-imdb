Honestly, if someone told me that the director of the Unfortunate Events Series of Lemony Snicket, City of Angels, and Caspers, was going to make a small low-budget indie movie and it would be really good, I'd say that person should be kidding. But that's what director Brad Siberling did. And it was really good. <br /> <br /> "10 Items or Less" has a similar concept to films like "Before Sunrise", "Lost in Translation" or more recently "Once". It is the chance meeting of two people who, if chance did not put them there, would probably never cross paths, or if they did, they would not tell each other. Like those films, "10 Items or Less" focuses on the relationship that is built and how the characters understand each other and are based on the strengths and weaknesses of each one. <br /> <br /> The story involves Morgan Freeman, playing an unidentified actor who will investigate his role as a grocery store clerk for an upcoming independent film and due to things beyond his control, ends the day with the lady in the 10 items or less in the lane that Paz Vega plays. She has a rotten marriage and hopes to get a new job as a secretary. Initially, Freeman's character just needs a lift home. However, after spending time with her, she wants to meet her and perhaps even offer some advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between Freeman and Vega. The plot is simply a configuration for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the 80-minute duration of the movie. Freeman has fun with his character, as he seems to be a stranger in the lower-class world in which the character of Vega, Scarlett, lives. Vega, meanwhile, grows beyond the obstinate paid employee, annoyed by the situation in her life that seeks to move forward. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of things that really stood out in this movie. First of all, Siberling probably took note of the independent film to make sure that the relationship is honest and that it does not fall into any Hollywood trap. It is a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film. It works, although the situation itself seems a bit inconceivable. <br /> <br /> I'm also impressed with the performances. While the presence of Freeman gives credibility to this film from the beginning, it shows a certain amount of charm and fun that is usually not seen in it. Meanwhile, Paz Vega is preparing for a breakthrough in American cinema in the future. I loved her in Spanglish and she is just as good as the hard and sensible scarlet. Towards the end of the film, she successfully transmits the growth of her character. I'm looking forward to seeing her in more movies. <br /> <br /> In general, 10 Items of Less works best as a character piece, well written and directed by Brad Siberling. He has not written much and his film work has mainly consisted of great Hollywood films. However, there is certainly an artist working here and I am anxious to see if he will take this path again.
