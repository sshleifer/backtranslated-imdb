Prix ​​de Beauté was made on the cusp of the change from silence to sound, which arrived a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as silent, it was released with a soundtrack dubbed in France, with a French actress who spoke of the Louise Brooks lines, but was released as a silence in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky enough to see the impeccable restoration of an Italian silent footprint of the Cineteca di Bologna at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume that the silent version is much more satisfying, since, according to all reports, the dubbing is wrong (Louise Brooks clearly speaks English, so there's no way to that their lips are paired.) In addition, the film is completely done in a silent style, with few titles and little need for dialogue. Prix ​​de Beauté tells her story visually, with an exciting and imaginative camera work. The opening is instantaneously kinetic, with scenes quickly cut off from urban life and swimmers splashing on a public beach. Throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual details, clothing, machinery, decoration and symbolic images, like a caged bird, a lot of broken photographs, a diamond bracelet. This is a silent film technique in its heyday. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving the film from obscurity. Seeing this makes it more heartbreaking to reflect that this was his last leading role. Lustrous beautiful, she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural but very loaded performance. Her role here, more than in the Pabst films for which she is best known, is a woman with whom we can fully understand and sympathize. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a possessive fiance, who yearns to get more out of life and secretly participates in a beauty contest, with immediate success. Then she struggles between the emotion of her new and glamorous life and her love for the man who insists that she abandon him or lose him. All the characters are drawn with nuances. The groom inspires grief and is not simply a brute: he loves Lucienne, but he is a limited man who can not cope with her by having a life apart from him or by attracting the attention of other men. Even the "other man" in history is not the simple slender ball we carry him to, although his intentions may be as possessive as those of a fiancé. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** WARNING: SPOILERS DOWN ************* **** <br /> <br /> The film has many fine-tuning pieces, including Lucienne's triumph in the "Miss Europe" contest, which is shown through the funny reactions of various audience members, who they end up throwing flowers at the heroine; her misery as a housewife, peeling potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks the time behind her; a nightmare trip to an amusement fair (in the silent version, this happens at the end of the movie, after their marriage) in which Lucienne, crushed among the poor and depressed by her husband's macho antics, decides that it can go with its present existence; and especially the final scene in the projection room where you see your talkie screen test. Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than here, with the beam of the projector blinking in her alabaster profile, her shoulders wrapped in white skin, her incandescent face under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on the screen . The double shot of his exquisite corpse and his image still alive on the screen is particularly poignant: the image of Louise Brooks, like Lucienne's, remains immortal despite her frustratingly aborted film career.
