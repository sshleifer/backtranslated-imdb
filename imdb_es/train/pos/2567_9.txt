James Michener's books that took readers to faraway places with strange names were probably at their most popular moment in the 1940s and 1950s. His Tales of the South Pacific became a great Broadway hit for Rodgers & Hammerstein . The South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and it was natural to make the film adaptation of another success of Michener, Sayonara. <br /> <br /> Only a decade earlier, American films during World War II did not portray the Japanese. kindly. I'm sure it was not easy for people who fought in the Pacific War to change their attitude overnight. That and a general policy of non-fraternization with the occupied peoples in general are at the center of this story about interracial romance. <br /> <br /> Sayonara is a relevant film today. The military has always focused on the personal life of its personnel in ways that no civilian employer could legally escape. In the United States, when Sayonara was made, miscegenation laws still existed in the books of many states. Today gays in the army is a big problem. Someone could one day make a Sayonara-type movie on that subject. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was on familiar ground. The South Pacific also had racism as a component of its plot. With a sure hand, Logan gathered a great cast and created a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith and some of the Western players do a good job. But the image is stolen by the orientals here. Miko Taka hits the mark beautifully as Brando's love interest. But the real stars are the two that one, both supporting players, Oscar, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. <br /> <br /> Buttons is the Air Force member of all enlisted men. He falls passionately in love with Katsumi played by Miyoshi Umeki. They get married and the military cruelly do everything they can to break them. They presume to KNOW what is best for Buttons and Umeki. Buttons was a television comedian and a great talent, but he never got a role as good as this for the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> And Miyoshi Umeki's Oscar was the first one given to an oriental. He received a lot of attention because at the time of the Academy Awards, Miyoshi was acting on Broadway at Flower Drum Song. I had the privilege of seeing it on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I saw. I still carry his memory. <br /> <br /> That Oscar also symbolized something else. Our war with Japan really ended and we saw Sayonara as a great nation with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, an actor in the Kabuki theater. If Sayonara had ended today, Logan would never get away with it. But Montalban is fine. <br /> <br /> Photograph of good location and a great history. This film should be revived more often as it has a great moral.
