['This was another great Tom Berenger movie ... But some people are right, it was like another character of SGT BARNES, but it was still impressive. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the jungle of Panama! At first, Billy Zane was very rare, like Cpl Upham of Saving Private Ryan, but in the end he became a little more aggressive! Sniper was amazing and action fans should see it ... I remind them that they would not have as much action as a reg action movie. I also got this on DVD and it&#39;s excellent!']
