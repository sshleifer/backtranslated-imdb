I did not expect much from this, but I must admit that I was rolling on the floor laughing a few times during this movie. If you do not feel offended in the first ten minutes, this could be a movie for you. The same thing happens if you're the type that would enjoy watching Amanda Peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half. Certainly not a comedy work of great importance, but given the low budget indisgenesis, this is masterly. To level the playing field for comparison, imagine all the studio movies with their budgets reduced by a factor of approximately 100 and look what you get! Congratulations to Peter Cohen and his network for seeing all this. I look forward to your next effort.
