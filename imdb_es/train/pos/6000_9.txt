Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) separates, misses her lover; she is not able to overcome her love for him that was lost in the past. She hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives her a list of her mistakes with things to fix. But time is irreversible and, sometimes, the cure for pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first point that impresses in "The Cure" is the cinematography with style that alternates white and black with color. The concise and sharp script is able to develop a tragic and somber love story with an unexpected plot point at the end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is a bit high and is associated with the fact that English is not my native language, in some moments I had to repeat some words whispered by the narrator. The unknown main actress has a magnificent performance and is extremely beautiful. I hope to have the opportunity to see her again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
