I chose to see this film in Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and it seemed like one of the best films of the festival. The two main actors offer a well-rounded sensitive interpretation that seems to coincide with the characters on a personal level. The director did a great job bringing characters and history to life with a skill that is not usually seen in a production for the first time. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect of this film is the love for wood and the city of New York. (Brooklyn in specific). The film revolves around the family furniture business and weaves a delicate photograph of the carpentry and everyday life of Brooklyn. again congratulations to the director for this excellent choice. <br /> <br /> This is a jewel and I would recommend it whole-heartedly (I'm sure it will appear on the screen).
