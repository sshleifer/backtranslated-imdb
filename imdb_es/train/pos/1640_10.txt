"Heartland" is a wonderful representation of what it really was like to live on the border. The hard work and individual strength needed to survive the difficulties of the weather and the lack of medical attention are combined with the camaraderie and interdependence of the settlers. The drama was especially significant because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was glamorous or it seemed that they had just passed a session with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is simply wonderful. She is an example of the strong and persevering people who came to Wyoming at the beginning of the 20th century and did not allow difficulties to get in the way of their new life in a new land.
