Someone mastered the difficult task of fusing sports with romance. Actually, sports and romance go together like oil and water. So, to successfully put the two together on the screen ... well, that's almost the equivalent of splitting the atom. I never thought it could be done. I will be the first to say that I do not like romantic comedies in general ... but I like sports and most sports movies. This movie was a good mix of the two. Being a baseball fan, I could really appreciate the comic experience with Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) as a rabid Boston Redsox fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the baby that tormented Redsox for 86 years, and they know how crazy many Redsox fans are about baseball. The Farrely brothers did a great job of capturing that and it was a good comedy. This was a very good movie that could attract many.
