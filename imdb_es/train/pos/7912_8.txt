These things have been floating in my head for almost 10 years. Some pieces of this work were really memorable. - I'd love to see another more current example of cg showy offy stuff. Actually I would love to be part of this. <br /> <br /> If I had the chance to say what I wanted and that's it, I would not have to write all this extra in order to do "10 lines if the text" as this website requires. Seriously? This almost discouraged me, luckily for the guys who made the movie, I really liked Minds Eye, and it took me three times to have enough lines, I hope you do not misunderstand me. - Yes, you did it.
