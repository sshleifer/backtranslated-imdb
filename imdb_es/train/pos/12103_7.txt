I've never seen a Barbara Steele movie that I did not like, and I've always been an imbecile for a good story about the haunted house (especially for such wonderful pictures as "The Legend of Hell House" and the original versions of "The Haunting" "and" House on Haunted Hill "), so I had the feeling that" Castle of Blood "would be in my alley. And boy, was it ever? This Franco-Italian co-production, although perhaps not the classic one that Steele's first horror film, "Black Sunday", remains to this day, is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric and chilling entry in the phantom genre. Filmed in black and white, it manages to transmit a truly spooky miasma. The film is about a journalist who bets on a Lord Blackwood and an author named Edgar Allen Poe who can spend the night at Blackwood Castle on All Saints' Day, when the spirits of those who died in the castle represent his destination. The viewer can see these deaths, and they are pretty horrible, for the most part. In fact, the film sends chills down the spine of the viewer, and on the uncut DVD that I just saw, thanks to the good people of Synapse, it even presents an amazing topless scene and a bit of lesbianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this movie; His otherworldly beauty is put to advantage when interpreting a sympathetic spectrum. His mere presence turns a story of spooky ghosts into something really memorable. Not in vain has he been called "The Queen of Horror".
