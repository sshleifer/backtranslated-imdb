I loved this excellent movie. Farrah Fawcett played the role phenomenally and with a good heart. She plays a woman who is forced to take extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After being rejected by the police, she realizes she is alone. <br /> <br /> Then, one day, when she was alone at home, the stranger bursts into her house and attacks her again. When she is not about to call the police or take him out, she is forced to spray it in her eyes and imprison him in her fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think a call for attention to the laws of the land is necessary. They are too easy for these criminals. It's time for harder punishments.
