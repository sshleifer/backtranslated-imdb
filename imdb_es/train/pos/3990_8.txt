May and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is uncomfortable because the grandchildren and the "children" do not really know each other as one might expect. The heat that should be there is missing. After dinner, May's husband says he does not feel well, he blames his daughter's food and says irritably that he wants to go home. Die that night. <br /> <br /> May, now a widow, is lost. Clearly she did not have a passionate or very interesting marriage, but she had a purpose. She had someone who needed her, and although her own needs had not been met for years, it had something to do with her days. <br /> <br /> She is depressed and unmotivated. She is going to stay with her daughter, Paula, who shortly after the arrival of her mother, tells her mother that she never felt that her mother has given much to herself. She releases anger at her mother's lack of upbringing. May seems to be unarmed and surprised, but neither does she seem to have the energy or desire to do well. "I am your mother and I love you". What does it really say? (I have heard this many times from my own mother and I have yet to discover what it means). Paula is a bit neurotic (well, more than a little). Both women are in need, although they show it very differently. <br /> <br /> Paula has been involved with a friend of her son, Darren, who is a maintenance staff who works at her son's home. While Paula is working during the day, May starts having conversations and lunches with Darren. Darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of his autistic son, Nicky, but supposedly does not live at home with his wife. <br /> <br /> May is attracted to Darren because he is virile and She enjoys the connection they seem to have. Darren is attracted to May because he offers him a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life. (She also cares too much about the money that May says she can give him to "get away from it all", although clearly he is not interested in his desire to join him on that trip, they end up sleeping together in the spare room. and May enjoys fulfillment as a woman she has not known in years, and had never expected to know again.As her daughter Paula had often told her that she would leave Darren, it became part of May's rationalization that What she is doing is fine. <br /> <br /> In a group of writers that Paula runs, she introduces herself to May, rather than being forced to meet a widower who does not attract her. sexual relations with the older man, who clearly can hardly act, and is really painful and disturbing when we see the total displeasure on May's face as she endures the only ghostly link. <br /> <br /> Finally, Paula discovers through some very graphic Sketches icos made by his mother, who in fact his mother and Darren have been having sex. <br /> <br /> This movie will undoubtedly be seen in many thousands of ways. The sympathies will be divided. At one point, during Paula's writing group, May reveals through a brief essay that she used to feel that she hated her children at the end of the day and that she would go to the bars after they were asleep, making sure to go back to house before. her husband. <br /> <br /> Clearly, a good mother does not think about leaving children alone while going to the local pub. May, however, had also previously revealed in the film that her husband did not like having friends, so he did not have any. She did what he wanted her to do. He was miserable, but he endured it because, as she said, "it was easier". So, while May was not the best mother, for those who were inclined to feel sympathy for her, one could see May's actions as the act of a woman who just wants to be sexual and live for a few minutes in her life. . A woman who just wanted someone to listen to her, to know her as a human being, to have a friend and a lover. <br /> <br /> Paula, although neurotic and unhappy, may have become like that because of the distant Parents who raised her. Certainly, it is not difficult to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made movie, with more complexities than I mentioned, and certainly one that will leave the viewer. Many, perhaps conflicting, reactions. It is a film that is worth discussing and debating, and, above all, worth seeing. <br /> <br /> One thing that the movie leaves us is the horror and the fear of a lonely life. No matter who is considered "correct" or who is considered "incorrect" by each viewer, that theme of old age and loneliness, which evokes a sense of fear in most of us, is inescapable.
