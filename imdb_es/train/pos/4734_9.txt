I'm a big fan of Jet Li! It is the best star of the Hong Kong action movie alive ... and, consequently, this movie was great! I saw it in the video store and, as it was in the general section of this video store, I did not register its presence at the beginning and I had to look twice. I immediately knew what I would be renting. My only drawback (I guess I expected it) is that it was doubled (AAARGh) and not subtitled. Otherwise, the original / strange / brilliant plot of the film, and full of action, turned it into one of Jet Li's best movies ... even though they all belong to that category ...
