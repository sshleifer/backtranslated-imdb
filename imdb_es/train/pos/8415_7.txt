If "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is the father of all horror films (and of German expressionist cinema), this film prior to World War I is the grandfather. The titular student, hungry in an empty garret, makes a deal with the devil: the devil gives him a bag of gold without a bottom, in exchange for "anything in this room". The devil chooses the reflection of the student in his mirror. It goes with the student's doppelganger, which commits crimes for which the student is blamed. <br /> <br /> The film is marked by some limitations that arise from the technically primitive state of cinema in 1913; The plot calls for chiaroscuro effects, but the film is, by necessity, virtually filmed in daylight without shadows. But the scene in which the reflection comes out of the mirror is still filled with things. <br /> <br /> More interesting for the trends that it holds that for its own sake, The Student of Prague is still worth it.
