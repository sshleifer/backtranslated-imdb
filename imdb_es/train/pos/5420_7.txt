The film is based on Kipling's heroic lines that inspire the biggest Hollywood movie of 1939. Out of the drum beat of Kipling's 85 most famous lines, an image emerges that will be known as the only great movie of the year. the battle, its war elephants, its hordes of bandits, its terrorist temples and the mystical mountains of India. The image is even bigger in its scope and reach, it is emotion and action but the greatest of all in life breathes through three (Gary Grant, Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) roaring, reckless and arrogant sons of men armed that run over their powerful scenes in the flesh and blood of the great adventure, is an honest film of everything that makes Gunga Din a new entertainment experience. Fontaine played her against the brave three sergeants. The romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr burned for days and nights of terror in a land where everything can happen. The movie is exciting for a thousand films looted in a big show. It is a fabulous adventure, furious and far away with the heroes of red blood and gunpowder that emerge from the mystery of Indian history and assault the screen with the lustful and ardent adventure. The robust thunder of life for men who fight for their love and love for fun. The images are interpreted for the brave and rogue Gary Grant, who surrounded the hundred villains Thugs and the evil Guru (Eduardo Ciannelli). Grant yells: You're under arrest! In addition to the heroic man of the water, Sam Jaffe, that the colonel regiment (Montagu Love) says about him: You are a better man than me, Gunga Din!
