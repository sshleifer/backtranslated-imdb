I have to say that Clive Barker's Undying is, by far, the best horror game ever created. I have played the games Resident Evil, Silent Hill and The Evil Dead and Castlevania, but none of them has captured the pure joy with which this game deals with its horrible elements. Barker is good at what he does, which is to tie the horror to our world, and it shows that his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. Heck, even your voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Filled with lush images and enough atmosphere to shake a stick, Undying is the game to win in my books as the best horror title. I just wish that this has reached a console system, but unfortunately the bad PC sales have affected that in the outbreak.
