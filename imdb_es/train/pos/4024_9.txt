I really liked this movie. He kept guessing until just before the end what would happen. One of the best movies about the partition I've seen. Urmila Matondkar is beautiful too. This is one of the most personal and realistic movies I've seen in the partition. It's a little less conventional than Gadar, and it's actually an emotional roller coaster in which you start with an opinion of what's happening, and you come out completely from the other side. This is not the typical Bollywood food, but an art-house type movie. The best part of this movie is that it does not dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when it focuses on another's story. It does not blame or punish, but it allows you to draw your own conclusions about things.
