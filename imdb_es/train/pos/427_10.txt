One of the best acting movies I've seen. There's not much in the plot, but the acting is incredible. You see that the characters change more and more subtly, under the influence of the villa rented in Italy, and love. And happiness. The film casts a fascinating spell on you, as does the villa with all the women. Really "enchanted".
