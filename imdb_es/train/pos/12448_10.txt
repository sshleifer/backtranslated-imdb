First of all; I am an enthusiastic fan of Modesty's, and I have been reading comics since I was a child, and I have found that previous films about our heroine are not satisfactory, but where they fail, this is ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Well, here we go: Mrs. Blaise is working for a casino, a band of thieves appears and she starts betting on the lives of her friends. If the thief wins a round, he will have to tell her about it. If you win twice in a row, one of the staff members is free. (Sounds stupid, yes, well, I'm not too good at explaining ...);) <br /> <br /> She tells him that she grew up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about how she helped an Elder in the refugee camp and how they escape, living according to the rules of nature. They hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight. As they get closer to civilization, they get caught up in a war, and when they are taken for rebellions, they are shot and the old man dies, leaving her alone to meet the city. <br /> <br /> Then she knows the man in which the casino is working, and that's where the story ends. <br /> <br /> What follows is that there is an incredible fight and the lines are totally great. Alexandra Staden is a TESTARIA Modesty Blaise! As modest and strong, elegant and intellectual as the comic-one. <br /> <br /> However, he feels uncomfortable, he also listens to Modestia speaking with a slightly broken accent, but that is not relevant since the comic book can not speak out loud, but it must surely have a accent something existing. (Not to mention it's rare that everyone speaks English in the Balkans ...) <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, even the child who personifies the young Blaise must be applauded! <br /> <br /> My favorite part should be where the dress breaks to kick the stupid thief's ass! Completely amazing! : D I can not wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie (s)! <br /> <br /> Look at it, you will not be disappointed!
