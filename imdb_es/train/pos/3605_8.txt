['Girlfight is using a well-known formula as someone pointed out, however, I have seen many films that do not do so well or that are not as credible. I think that, in the end, it&#39;s easier for a woman to empathize with the character and feel more moved by the movie. <br /><br /> The film is encouraging both mentally and physically, even if your life and your surroundings were completely different and, I think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this. Although it took me 5 years to start boxing and playing sports in general, this is the movie that gave me the spark. <br /><br /> So the plot is familiar / common. the actors are good but the thoughts that they can provoke are those that do it above the average in my opinion. It made a great impression on me and I know I&#39;m not the only one.']
