Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo star in this fun and funny movie. The late Fred Gwynne is really wonderful as Herman Munster, who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), his wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and the grandfather begin to terrorize the city, everyone blames the two. The two now have to clear their names before it's too late. You will laugh out loud as I did.
