I felt it was necessary to respond to the comments posted on the first page of this film's page because part of it was a bit disinformative. <br /> <br /> Originally I published quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was correct since this is the index of "comments" and not a message board (although we used to use them that way before IMDb add the message boards of the movie), so I'll edit it to make it unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all you might not realize this, but Gene Kelly became famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a "panoramic" film of Gershwin, he wanted the character of Kelly to be more sophisticated than the "two shoes" roles he had played in most of his films (with the exception of "For Me and My Gal"). "). Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to build a new story set in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey." This gave Kelly the opportunity to play his famous Broadway role even though Warners had outdone MGM for the rights of "Pal Joey." In my opinion, the WB movie "Pal Joey" is a disaster, although Sinatra was suitable for the role, but other problems sank the movie (script changes and misdirection. ============ == ====================================== You complain about Kelly's photos are not well made, even citing her artistic education to prove the point, but the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad is missing, and is necessary for the story / characters. images are very bad, the audience knows Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even he knows it, although Milo has sweetened it to the point where he almost believes it, but it is important that the audience is not sitting there saying "but it's a great artist., if only he had the chance! "He wants the public to be fully aware of his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> He then complains that he sabotages his interest in the show, once again, he is not enter giving the structure of History. He refuses because he does not want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows he is not really ready for the exhibition. His enthusiasm for the show is certainly not as great as "Joey's" enthusiasm for "starting a nightclub." But it fulfills the same function in the plot. Remember, it's essential in "Pal Joey" (the play) that Joey leaves his nightclub when he realizes he does not deserve it. The same with the art show. If Kelly's paintings were really good, it would undermine this whole point. ==================================================================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly do not have "chemistry". I guess it's in the eye of the beholder. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was fine. Compare it to other "forced" romances such as Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "Pride and Passion." ==================================================================================================== == <br /> <br /> When you say that the grand finale of the dance has nothing to do with anything else in this movie, it only shows that you have not dug under the surface of the film in its symbolism. Many elements in the dance sequence are related to the story and the characters, and through the dance, the plot is resolved through images and symbolism. It's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (look around and your love is gone). The movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene reflects a separate phase of Parisian art and also a separate phase of their relations. If you did not see it, it's not the movie's fault. It certainly is not a "garbage load". ====================================================================================================
