Man, this is a hard DVD to get. I could only find it in Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Okay, yes. Not so much because it is a masterpiece of film making, although it is directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com read "Robert" but the list of DVD credits Curt), or because it has a couple of known figures of others murder mysteries ... Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gómez, but due to my curiosity of the decade about the film has finally been satisfied. <br /> <br /> Essentially, a respected but independent engineer (Alan Curtis) has stood out above for his estranged wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two tickets to the show in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the bench next to him and he kindly invites her to join him in the musical review. She accepts, a little sad. The mopey bartender gives both of them the eye when they leave. <br /> <br /> In the show, the stormy star realizes that this lady of the public wears the same hat and bursts into the stage with fury. The drummer of the band, Cook, says to the silent lady but does not get an answer. Curtis takes the woman home and asks her name, but she does not give it and she does not want to know his. If I had been a devotee of Longfellow, I would have said something about the ships that pass in the night. <br /> <br /> Okay, Curtis goes home and discovers that his wife was killed in his absence. The police chief, Gómez, delivers it to the prosecutor's office. His only alibi is that he was with a ghost lady that no one else seems to remember, not with the bartender, with the Latin star, or with the taxi driver ("Al Alp"), nor with the drummer, but from the lady herself . It has disappeared, it is impossible to dig it up. <br /> <br /> Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die. But Inspector Gomez has thought about things and decided that she is probably innocent because nobody with a brain would invent such a stupid story. He joins Curtis' beloved secretary, Ella Raines, to re-investigate the case informally. <br /> <br /> They visit the alleged witnesses again. The ominous waiter is hit by a car, maybe accidentally, so he is out of the picture. The bad-tempered Latina is gone because the show closed and she does not cooperate and ignores the hat's source anyway. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real killer, but not before he appears in a scene where he plays drums in an improvised jazz band. His sweaty face assumes an expression that does not suggest an intense focus, but rather a monstrous orgasmic madness. His eyes move towards the ceiling, his mouth opens, his hammering becomes frantic. I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Nobody's performance is exceptional, but they are all professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. The best performance, however, is probably by Franchot Tone. He is the real murderer and falsifies his alibi. It is reserved and artistic. Even when he faints, he is decorous. I do not know how to say it accurately, but Tone seems to be thinking and acting simply as part of it. Alan Curtis, as an innocent engineer, is close to zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs to an image B. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it is considered classic. It's really your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But the direction of Siodmak is sensitive. A man is run over and his hat is rolled up in a channel with water running around him. His use of shadows is silently effective. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I succeeded.
