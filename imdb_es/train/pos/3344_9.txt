I went to see Fever Pitch with my mom and I can say that we both loved it. It was not the typical romantic comedy in which someone is anxious about the other, and blah, blah, blah ... You did not expect the first climatic kiss or that they finally met. It was more real, because he saw them through the relationship, instead of the whole movie trying to get them together. People could really relate to the movie, because they did not seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was really fun, and I think it was the best performance of Jimmy Fallon. In short ... I would definitely recommend it!
