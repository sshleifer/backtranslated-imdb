There are few comedies like this, where almost all the lines and all the characters are almost perfect. This is so funny! And he has enough satire for that. Sally Field leads the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good job, if not perfect, with her daytime television diva. Sometimes, his performance is too broad and exaggerated, but 90% of the time it's a fuss. In the same league are Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately has very little to do here). Downey jr can not fully convince as a comedian and does not have the right moment all the time, but he struggles with his part, which is, to be honest, the most ungrateful. But the bright star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a real bitch if there was ever one with more than one nasty secret (you'll see her in the end absolutely awesome!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems very comfortable with her part. Normally I like Mrs. Shue, but here she acts like a fish out of water and sometimes, it seems to be in a different movie. But it is not harmful and for the most part it is at least adequate. Otherwise, brimming with memorable lines and situations, this is a comedy to watch when you're on TV or wherever.
