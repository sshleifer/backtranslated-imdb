The actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams has got the comedy role of Osiric, otherwise it might be a bit strange to see him in a production like that. It's really great that Kenneth has decided to use the most complete version of the text. This happens definitely not very often ... Thanks to this, the spectators can see the whole, not the chosen one, the director, the parties. Also, thank God that the movie is in a classic form; NO to surrealist fanfaberies! Although "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive, however, but Hamlet is a different story, at least that is my point of view.
