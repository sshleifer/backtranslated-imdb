"How to lose friends and alienate people" is an entertaining, albeit loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoirs of the same name. It's also a great title to help fill the line requirement in the IMDb reviews! The basic essence is the same as the book with certain dramatized incidents, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is undoubtedly Hollywoodized. Simon Pegg, despite playing an essentially irritating person, is his usual, friendly and funny person, and practically takes the film. It is strange to think that only a few years ago he was just a comedy guy and now he is rubbing shoulders with Hollywood names. There's a good cast cast and it's a fun and easy watch, like a 'Ugly Betty' man, but more fun.
