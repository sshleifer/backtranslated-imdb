One of my favorite "domestic" movies. I do not know if there is someone in our country who has not seen this movie! It's funny and sad in some moments ... I do not know how people from all over the world (who had the chance to see it) accepted this film, because they must know some moments of our Serbian history and the character of the Serbs in the first half of the twentieth century, to be able to understand it! But as I see here, there is someone from Canada who saw it ... and he liked it. <br /> <br /> I think I will try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this site, but first to find out how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Regards.
