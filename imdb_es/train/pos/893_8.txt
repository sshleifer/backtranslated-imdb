['Sammo Hung&#39;s 1989 film, Pedicab Driver, is considered by many to be his masterpiece. I have to agree to some extent, since the movie in its best parts really becomes as amazing and fantastic as any Hong Kong movie. It is a combination of pretty good and well-written drama, interesting and friendly characters (and also not sympathetic), some genuinely funny humor and a hyper exaggerated hyper-kung fu that is guaranteed to surprise many when someone is not familiar. The Hong Kong cinema sees the film and also the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry. <br /><br /> Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung play with two pedicab riders who live in Hong Kong in the middle of the last century, I think. They drive their taxis and they are also desperate for love. Sammo is interested in the local baker Ping (Nina Li Chi), while Max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying, whom he falls madly in love with. Many other characters are also presented, and they remain quite clear all the time if the viewer really focuses on the film and its plot, so I can not say that the film is confusing, since it could be much worse, especially in Hong Kong ! Soon we can know, for example, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and, of course, their violent acts also affect our protagonists, and so the premise of some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fighting sequences was created. . As well as a good drama. <br /><br /> The movie has a great cast. All the potential clients are very good and moderate (not so exaggeratedly painful and &quot;humorous&quot;, like for example, the great Condores of the East of Sammo (1987), for example) and also they are, thanks to the script carefully written, quite pleasant and easy. to identify with. The cast includes many faces and film directors from Hong Kong in small roles such as Corey Yuen Kwai (the legendary director of action and director of films such as Savior of the Soul 1 and 2, Ninja in the Dragon&#39;s Den and Fong Sai Yuk 1 and 2 ), master composer Lowell Lo Koon-Ting (The Killer and Ringo Lam&#39;s School on Fire and John Woo&#39;s Prison on Fire, including Pedicab Driver!), Shaw Liu veteran Chia Liang (who with Sammo has a furious wrestling with sticks), Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting (the director of the classic Dark HK noir On the Run since 1988), the great deceased Lam Ching Ying (best known for his friendly face in various horror comedies / kung fu / comedies of HK vampires), to name just a few. In fact, the cast of Pedicab Driver is one of the most interesting I&#39;ve seen in any other HK production. <br /><br /> The film has some interesting moments of peace, especially about the love story between Max Mok and Fennie Yuen, and a crisis they face thanks to the character of Lowell Lo. They really could have done this in a completely serious way if they had wanted to, since discussions about human values and the meaning of love, no matter what their past or what they have done to live, are so serious and genuinely effective in the middle part The film immediately becomes much more noticeable than our average action in the kung fu show. In addition, the efforts of the other characters to heal things are very moving and tell deliciously a lot about human relationships, friendship and, of course, love. Still, I think that what Fennie says to Max (about the future &quot;bad cooking&quot;) is very unnecessary and discourages the potential of the whole segment and its issues quite effectively, unfortunately. <br /><br /> But then we came to what most interested the filmmakers. What is the action, the outrageous and exaggerated action. The fighting scenes include traditional kung fu, some sticks, knives for meat and the like, and they are used here as hysterically as in the most amazing kung fu scene I have seen in any movie, Jackie Chan&#39;s Drunken Master II (1994), They really are so great! There are cables and they are used very intelligently and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they are kicked or hit. Simply amazing and, again, something that ONLY the cinema of Hong Kong can offer. In addition, dangerous stunts cause the viewer to hold their breath, as the film has a fast sequence of car chase against pedicab and several dangerous looking jumps and twisted bodies flying through the air and crushing hard in the difficult destination. Even so, the filmmakers do not seem to &quot;accept&quot; the violence of the film, since Sammo, like the late Bruce Lee, is willing to surrender after the last murderous chaos in the gangster village, and I think that this kind of moral, not it matters how obvious or superficial it can be, it&#39;s a good thing even in a harmless film like this, since the cinema pretends to be much more than just entertainment without a brain. <br /><br /> The film also has a bit of witty humor that I&#39;m not sure everyone in Hollywood or America (for example) understands or likes at all. The funny Star Wars gag at the beginning is definitely between these and it literally forced me to laugh when I realized what I was seeing. Also some funny scenes are created from the passion of Sammo by Ping. However, the biggest laugh filled with astonishment occurred during the scenes depicted in the old paragraph, since the images of large, tall men flying with great force onto the screen towards the walls or furniture are simply SO MUCH and so impressive that they simply I can not hide my feelings and thoughts about these Oriental filmmakers when I witnessed something like this, and this is just a positive and appreciative reaction, of course. <br /><br /> Pedicab Driver is one of the most incredible Hong Kong action movies I&#39;ve seen and is easily among the great achievements of Sammo. If the few minor flaws were not there, this could qualify even brighter and higher. 8/10']
