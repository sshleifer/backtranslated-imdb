The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I have remembered all these years since I could not sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It just shook me absolutely. I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft. Worth, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this so I can see her as an adult. It took a lot of research to find out what movie it was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and I was finally able to get the name and the reviews. I enjoyed it a lot, but it scared me a lot! Jaqui
