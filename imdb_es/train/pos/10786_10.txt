My sister and I used to rent this every time we had movies and our parents got so mad (but they let us) and I love it ... I can not find anyone who lives near me who knows what I do. I'm talking about ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I wish I could find this on DVD somewhere! I would love to see this now just because I loved it as much as a small child ... and now I am 15 years old! I remember a lot about that ... that's where I got the little bunny fufu song and all my friends know the song, but not the movie! I think the girl got there sliding down the slide in her little playground
