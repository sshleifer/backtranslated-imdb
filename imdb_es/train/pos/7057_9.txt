['As an adult I really enjoyed this. I saw it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 and a half year old boy was fascinated and the 15 month old boy laughed at the mice. <br /><br /> The music is fun and the animation is wonderful. This sequel does what Return to Neverland did not achieve. A good follow-up of the Cinderella story; But what about Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope so!']
