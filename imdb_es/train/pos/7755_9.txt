"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible movie, wonderfully perverted, as only director Sirk could have done. The film is immersed in a bucket full of strange Freudian symbols, strange melodramatic and colorful contrasts. The connection between financial success and moral decadence is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to see the film as an excellent example of what Sirk could do with the kitsch material. The color palette is particularly impressive. The acting in the movie is also great. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), who manage to keep the film at one point of boiling. Congratulations to the beating score of Frank Skinner, Russell Metty's brilliant camera work (each shot is a masterpiece in itself) and the production design department. In addition, the melody of the title is a beauty. It is an unforgettable movie.
