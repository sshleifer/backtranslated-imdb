This was the eighth and last film of Columbia Whistler and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from the cinema and who was going to die the following year. Still a competent thriller, the machine continued without him perfectly, but? Something was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, the scripts often noir always atmospheric, but it was not just Whistler himself that hung everything on the screen, Dix as well. <br /> <br /> Young A couple who goes out for a full fortnight feels the need to get married in the rain, but is frustrated when the potential girlfriend disappears for the first time and then it is discovered that she is already married before apparently go crazy Is the potential boyfriend disillusioned, even when the private cock he has hired to find her suddenly whips and licks him, or is love blind? Who is twisting who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is fine if it is a little weak, the best moments of the lovely Lenore Aubert came to the next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful as always borrowed by Boston Blackie. Also the only ride where the Whistler itself must have gotten wet when bending over in the rain, unless it has been sprayed with foam on the Voice. <br /> <br /> A lot has happened in this last hour, it's worth keeping an eye on them. Once again as usual for fans of the genre like me. Whistler's radio series, which began in 1942, continued until 1955 with almost 700 half-hour shows, almost all available in mp3 and based on what I've heard so far, and all of them are well worth listening to as well.
