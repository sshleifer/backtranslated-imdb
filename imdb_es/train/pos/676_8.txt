'The last wave' is much more than the sum of its parts. It is not simply a disaster film, it is not simply an exploration of Australian Aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than a simple court drama. The writer / director Peter Weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a really effective and stimulating film with the same mysterious atmosphere that gave 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' two years before, which will continue to remember years later. . <br /> <br /> When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) for the death of an aboriginal for whom he may or may not be directly responsible, he finds himself not only struggling to obtain truth of Lee, but giving meaning to what he hears when it arrives. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds: that of every day and that of dreams, truth exists on two completely different levels, with more disastrous ramifications than Burton could have imagined. <br /> <br /> No doubt the reason why the 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' is best remembered because of its enduring mystery. We are guided along the same path, but we are forced to find answers for ourselves. In 'The Last Wave', we can put everything together at the end of the movie. However, even with all the information, we have to choose how much of that we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the limits of our normal realities. <br /> <br /> On the production side, Weir uses his Budget for a great effect, progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting, intense rain, to sound use of sound. The incidental music is discreet, never trying to be great. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the bewilderment that the public would undoubtedly feel while trying to unravel the mystery. David Gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds, wanting to do the right thing, but with fear because he already knows the end. <br /> <br /> If you put all these things together, you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a familiar name in movies thirty years later. Highly recommended.
