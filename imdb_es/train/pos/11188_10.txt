['I&#39;m a big fan of Stephen King&#39;s work, and this movie has made me an even bigger fan of King. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They just moved into a new house and they seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind his house. Creed&#39;s new neighbor, Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the cemetery behind the pet cemetery. That cemetery is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a human being (or any type of pet) in the cemetery, they will come back to life. The only problem is that when they return, they are NOT the same person, they are evil. Shortly after Jud explains everything about the Pet Sematary, everything begins to go to hell. I will not explain more because I do not want to reveal some of the main parts of the film. Pet Sematary&#39;s performance was pretty good, but it needed a little work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, mainly because it was very original and exciting. This film has many makeup effects that make the film more strange and terrifying. One of the most basic reasons why this movie made me shiver was the makeup effects. There is a character in this movie that is really strange. That character is &quot;Zelda&quot;. This particular character appears in the movie approximately three times to be precise. Zelda is the sister of Rachel Creed who died years before, but Rachel is still obsessed by her. The first time that Zelda appears in the film is not usually scary because she does not speak or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares my life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it&#39;s almost perfect. Pet Sematary offers great fears, a little good acting, a first level plot and a fascinating makeup. This is truly one of the most favorite horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10']
