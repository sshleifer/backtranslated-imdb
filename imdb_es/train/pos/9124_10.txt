Bar some of the questionable performances (there are musicians at the end of the day), this in Quentin Tarrinno's words is "The best rock movie ever made ... period" <br /> <br /> Think 8 Mile, but without the rap, a young musician, who tries to prove his worth to the local community, while struggling to deal with a broken home and a rival gang. Add sexual interest and really exceptional performances, this is the true 8 miles. <br /> <br /> Prince offers a solid performance, as does Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent writing, good direction, great plot, and spectacular performances. Without forgetting the best rock / pop / funk music I've ever heard.
