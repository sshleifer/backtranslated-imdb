While I was watching this movie in video last night, I kept getting these tingles that told me that this will last. I have the feeling that I will be seeing this again and again during the next few years. <br /> <br /> It has all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story / movie. And even though some cultural references are obscure to me, a Western spectator, deep down this is a universal story.
