['This is the only movie I&#39;ve seen Prince, but it does not matter. And I thought he was just great singing, I was wrong. This is probably his best performance. The music is great That&#39;s why he won the Oscar in 1984 for the best music for a movie (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and a Grammy under his belt. Although curses get in the way with the movie (just make sure there are no small children or in the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You really should go out and get this movie that your collection is not complete unless you have this movie in it. What else could I say, except go and get this movie now?']
