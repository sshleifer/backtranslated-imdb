This was the first of the Panahi movies I've seen, I saw it at the Melbourne Film Festival. He was totally absorbed by the different characters he creates and how different they react and behave compared to Australian children and yet, on other levels, in a similar way. I think maybe if more people could watch movies like this, they could see people as individuals and avoid the racism that can often be fueled by fear of the unknown. There are the great obvious political differences between the culture of Oz and the Iranian culture, but I found the subtlest differences between the characters, which this film casts so successfully on the screen, extremely fascinating. There are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem so unique to me. I thought the characters were fascinating to watch.
