['For the viewer who finds it long after its creation, &quot;Winchester &#39;73&quot; has something in common with &quot;Casablanca&quot;. While you look at it, you have the feeling that you are seeing a series of clichés that are so frequently found in the genre; Then you realize that the clichés became cliches only after they were copied from this particular movie, and that they were copied so widely because this movie was great. In other words, it is a seminal work. <br /><br /> &quot;Winchester &#39;73&quot; is a joy to watch. The general lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but above all because you&#39;ve seen them copied so many times in subsequent films, and yet still contains a series of twists that surprise you. Mann&#39;s dialogue, pace and direction are excellent. Stewart shines in particular, and if you are a fan, this is something you &quot;must see&quot;, but you are not alone in delivering a good performance. Surprisingly, many of the more thoughtful and / or ingenious lines are aimed at secondary characters. Because this makes these characters (a lot) more than cardboard cutouts, it gave an additional realism to the film. <br /><br /> This is a notoriously underestimated movie, and it&#39;s worth watching. The DVD also contains an interview with Stewart that provides information about the film.']
