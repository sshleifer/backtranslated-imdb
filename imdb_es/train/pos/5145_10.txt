<br /> <br /> An old man works as a janitor in a psychiatric hospital to be near his wife who is patient there and try to get her out. <br /> <br /> This is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and a rarity in the history of Japanese cinema. For a long time lost, a track was found in the 70s and a musical soundtrack was added that fits perfectly with the images. He could have been influenced by Dr. Caligary's cabinet (director Kinugasa said he never saw the German movie). However, he excels in style and in his most convincing (and cold) portrait of the inner mental state of inmates in the asylum. To achieve this, the film uses all the film techniques available at the moment: multiple exposures and unfocused subjective points of view, inclined camera angles, fast and slow camera, expressionist lighting and overlays among others. It is also a very complicated film to follow, since it does not have intertitles. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a montage of rain shots hitting the hospital windows, the wind shaking trees and thunder. The unsettling climate metaphorizes the mental condition of the patients and introduces one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as the music that incites the dancer to enter a frantic, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence involving the same patient involved in another frantic dance, she is being observed by other inmates. The multiple exhibitions of the dancer represent the point of view of the patients and their confused "vision" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this incredible movie that tries to represent the subconscious and the vision of patients. Healthy world". <br /> <br /> In three words A MUST SEE.
