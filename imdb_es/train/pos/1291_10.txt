This is a good movie. Something fun about seeing money flow at an excellent speed, especially from a child's point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a child's dream come true and what a child could do with $ 1 million dollars. I do not like it, do not look at it. They make films for viewers, not for people who have nothing better to do and then complain about their lives.
