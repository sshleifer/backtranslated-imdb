I have to say that Seventeen & Missing is much better than I expected. The perception that I took of the advances was that it would be simply monotonous, but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, a mother who insists that her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), does not attend the so-called prom one night of the week, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and he leaves for the party anyway. When Lori does not return home, Emilie knows something is wrong and begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led her to disappear. <br /> <br /> Seventeen & Missing is better than so many other TV movies of This type, since it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie, and most of it is considered credible. This original LMN movie premiered last night. 10/10
