Yeah sure. Sammo Hung already starred in the lead role in "Zu Warrios from Magic Mountain" in 1983. Now, 2001, he does it again with "Zu Warriors". But this time, it finally does well. You rarely see him in Wuxia, more often in oriental slapstick or classic crime. But this paper simply fits him! The ancient Chinese legend about zu mountain is not usually represented in movies (as far as I know about films translated to the west). Although, the legend contains a lot of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: you have not seen a similar story in a modern movie yet! And that makes it so great! And wow: all the colors, plus the hugely deep story and direct to the heart, make you fall in love with this movie in an instant. The first time I saw it, I had to see it again instantly, and I did. OK, I did not understand everything the first time. But that makes it only better! You know, you did not understand everything, because there's a lot of spice in it! Therefore, it is a pleasure for oneself to see it again and again. And yes, it grows deeper in your heart, the more often you look at it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A story to love, characters you cry with and, really: a movie you never forget! - Editor's note: well, I think I should see it right now again: D
