This film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and, definitely, one of the best. The stage is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The photography of the film is excellent, as is the performance of Turturro and Watson. Turturro definitely gives its best performance to date showing that it is worth much more than we thought. Watson also has a brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> The story is about a great chess player (Turturro) who is also extremely eccentric in his daily life. The film is presented in a non-linear time, with multiple flashbacks from Luzhin's childhood. Through them, the complex character of Luzhin is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say, but suggest this movie to anyone.
