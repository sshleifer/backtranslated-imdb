As a collector of movie memories, I had to buy the movie poster for this film that, now that I've finally seen it, has to be the best. There is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melted man. However, there is nothing more horrible to put in your VCR than an image of an hour and a half of the melted man. At first I thought that this movie was pure rubbish, but then I realized that it had some qualities that made me laugh. The character of Dr. Ted Nelson has to be the most insipid person who has taken to the big screen. His dialogue is so trite that it is incredible! ("It's amazing! It looks like it's getting stronger as it melts!) <br /> <br /> And could someone please tell me how the hell they know exactly how much time Steve has left before it melts completely? And exactly what they do, is the plan "to help you?" If this movie was meant to scare your audience, I think you lost your vocation.
