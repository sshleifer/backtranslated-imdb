Most of the war movies made in the USA. UU During the Second World War they were very funny to watch, but they suffered serious gaps in realism because they were produced more for their propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else. I am not hitting these films since many of them are still very visible. However, because they often lack realism, they are prevented from being really great movies. A perfect example was John Garfield's Air Force film, in which a B-17 almost single-handedly eliminates half of the Japanese air force. However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure, with high marks to represent a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was NOT a true story, as it seemed too unlikely to be true. However, after further investigation, I discovered that, in fact, I was quite faithful to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the Medal of Honor. This is a case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!
