This movie exceeded my expectations. I thought and I heard it was going to be rubbish, so I did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I did not get along with the main girl and I really did not care if she lived or died. After a while, she definitely grew up in me and became a nice character. It's not just a slasher movie where people die for no reason. There is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the movie, but it explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you're not sure, just look at it anyway, it's only an hour and a half of your life. Anyway, you will live 80 years.
