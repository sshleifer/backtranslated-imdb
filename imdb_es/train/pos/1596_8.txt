Although Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts for them; this is where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years, still in love. The whole cast does a good job from Aiello to John Mahoney, it shows a true life. Although I saw this a long time ago, I am glad that I finally catapulted Cage to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From the music to the scenes of the opera and the arguments of the kitchen table, this is a very entertaining film.
