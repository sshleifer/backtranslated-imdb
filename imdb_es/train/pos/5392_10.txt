['The waiting room of the woman of a large hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where life begins. <br /><br /> This almost forgotten drama is a small and beautiful telenovela, full of comedy and tragedy, all linked to the life of the maternity staff and their patients. The frankness with which the subject is handled indicates the state of the previous code of the film. <br /><br /> The wonderful Aline MacMahon, as a friendly head nurse, is the quiet center of the film, the rock around which all the currents flow. Able to handle any crisis or emergency, is the best friend of the mother, sometimes the last. Around MacMahon there is a group of excellent costars: Loretta Young as a convicted murderer released from prison long enough to give birth; Eric Linden as his scared young husband; Glenda Farrell as a lady who hates children; the sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother in her sixth birth; Preston Foster &amp; Hale Hamilton as thoughtful and compassionate doctors, and Frank McHugh as a comically frantic future father. <br /><br /> Film experts will recognize Bobs Watson as a little boy who wants to see the stork; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a &quot;little soldier&quot;; Gilbert Roland as an anguished Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as the wife of a presumptive doctor interested in adopting Farrell&#39;s son, all uncredited. <br /><br /> There are some absurdities in the plot: some of the mothers are obviously too old; Farrell gets shamelessly drunk in the neighborhood, but none of the employees seems to notice; An obviously psychotic patient is able to wander at will, but this only enhances the peculiar entertainment value of the film and prevents things from becoming too serious.']
