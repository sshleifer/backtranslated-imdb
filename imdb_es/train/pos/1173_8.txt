"Night of the Living Homeless" was a pretty strong ending for the first half of season 11. Obviously, a parody of several zombie movies, especially Dawn of the Dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the undead , as creatures that feed and thrive thanks to the spare change instead of the brains. <br /> <br /> Kyle is blamed for the sudden massive outbreak of homeless people when he, by the kindness of his heart, gives $ 20 to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the city is completely invaded by them. This is a very strong episode of Randy Marsh, as he assumes the role of shotgun leader for the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy reaches the community center, he is approached by hundreds of homeless people and shouts "I have no change!" Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by taking a bus out of town and, without knowing it, throws all his change on the bus to distract the homeless. Then he becomes one of them and asks everyone for a change. <br /> <br /> Children try to find out why there are so many homeless in South Park, and find a man who is director of studies for the homeless. They discover that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately, the homeless burst into the man's house, and he tries to take the easy way by shooting himself. However, it fails several times, as it shoots in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until it finally dies. This scene may have been more fun if a similar scene had not happened in "Fantastic Easter Special" two weeks ago. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that, due to the problem of the homeless, property values ​​have fallen. Thus, the bank has foreclosed on his house, leaving him homeless. Randy turns immediately to him, holding the gun to the man's head. When the man finally begs the others for some money to help him, Randy pulls the trigger. <br /> <br /> In Evergreen, children discover that city citizens sent homeless people to South Park, and that the passage of homeless people from one town to another occurs throughout the country. The boys modify a bus that takes the homeless out of South Park and takes them to Santa Monica, California. <br /> <br /> The parallels of the zombie movie and the great lines of Randy Marsh make this definitely definite. 8/10
