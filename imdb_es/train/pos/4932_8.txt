In Panic In The Streets, Richard Widmark plays the doctor of the US Navy. UU., Who had his week abruptly interrupted with a corpse that contains plague. As policeman Paul Douglas points out properly, the guy died of two bullets in the chest. That's not the problem here, the two become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease. <br /> <br /> As any number of people pointed out, for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother to release the small parts with someone who looks like they are from Louisiana. Having been to New Orleans, where the story takes place, I can personally witness it. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because as a Navy doctor he could be assigned there, but for the natives it does not work. <br /> <br /> But with the plague and the news Keeping secret, the New Orleans police begins a raid on the underworld of the city. The dead guy left a ship from Europe and had connections with the underworld. A wise guy from New Orleans played by Jack Palance jumps to a lot of wrong conclusions and begins to harass a cousin of the dead guy who begins to show symptoms of plague. Palance received excellent reviews in the first film in which he received notification. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite in this movie is Zero Mostel. This happened just before Mostel was on the blacklist and around that time he specialized in playing would be the tough guys who are really adorable. Play the same kind of role in Humphrey Bogart's movie, The Enforcer. Unfortunately, I can identify with Mostel in the last chase scene where he and Palance are being chased by Widmark, Douglas and half the New Orleans Police. Seeing the challenge of the Zero weight trying to keep up with Palance was something else because I am now in the Zero league in the personnel department. <br /> <br /> Kazan maintained the action at a good pace, there is very little downtime in this movie. If there were less, it would be an Indiana Jones movie. Panic In The Streets won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay that year. <br /> <br /> Kazan also made good use of the New Orleans and French Quarter coastline. Some of the same types of shots are used later in On the Waterfront. In fact, Panic In The Streets is about people who do not shout when they should do it in their best interest. Very similar again to On the Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Panic In The Streets makes everyone feel proud of the related. Now, why could not Elia Kazan get some decent people from New Orleans to play in the small roles?
