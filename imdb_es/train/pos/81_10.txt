I saw the McCoys meeting and I was glad to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez. Seeing them now was wonderful, because I always saw the program grow, so when the TV said there was going to be a meeting, I was so excited! The only thing I could not figure out is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke) were not there. I know Walter Brennan was dead. So I got on my computer and I tried to find out about them and I found this site, so if there's someone out there who can tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (to little Luke, I'd be grateful I've searched everywhere and I have not had any luck. "The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman is that he was supposed to be born in 1946. This program had value and morals, each program taught a lesson to learn. Today they do not have that ... The whole cast was amazing, the only thing better than finding out is meeting them, so that's impossible if there's someone who can help, please, thank you, Glenda.
