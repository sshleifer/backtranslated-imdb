The premise of the story is simple: an old man who lives alone in the woods accidentally encounters the murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred. Although very little dialogue is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative told only by the camera's eye makes the film quite attractive. The configuration of gray forests conveys a sense of loneliness, which complements the tranquility of the characters themselves. We can also feel the impotence in the face of the inability of the elder to convince the police of the murder, which is parallel to the inability of the silenced child to tell his own story. <br /> <br /> The real horror lies in the feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. . This film successfully addresses these elements only with visual elements, instead of relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other horror movies misuse when the narrative is weak. <br /> <br /> Intelligently, the story unfolds at a slow pace to increase tension for a few shocking and surprising moments. The ending is also unexpected and credible. Reminiscent of Japanese horror films, such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water", or horror films in English, such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents", this film offers viewers the experience of true horror of the atmosphere. I recommend to anyone who enjoys a good chill the fear of bones to try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have not seen the movies I just mentioned, you may want to give them. an attempt too
