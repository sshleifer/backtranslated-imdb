The violent and rebellious sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), of twenty-five years, is sent to three sessions for his evaluation with the naval psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), after another outburst and aggression against a man of the Navy of top Rank. Reluctant to start treatment, he gains confidence in Dr. Davenport and reveals his childhood, revealing painful traumas generated in his foster home. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant), and they fall in love with each other. Solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This true family drama is a moving and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a normal life. The address of Denzel Washington is excellent, it is sensitive, attractive and with good taste, a story about child abuse. In the hands of another director, it could be a very heavy story. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltando a Viver' ('Returning to Live')
