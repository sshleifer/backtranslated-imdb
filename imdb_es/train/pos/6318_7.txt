I tried to rent this on many occasions, but I was always with the girlfriend, who, as a rule, generally rejects the hold-up movies and the comedies together with the comment "Uhm ... it looks good, but I'm not in the mood for that movie ". This is how the "Almighty Solo Movie Night" comes in! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a pretty nice movie. While it is ultimately quite forgettable, it has moments of fun and some laugh loudly. I was not familiar with the fact that it was a new version, and as a general rule, watch movies trying to ignore that fact and see them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts a short and funny cameo as a safe and rolled cookie that, for the most part, leaves me thinking two things ... 1. Would not every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney included a strange 5-minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and discolored, and how easily do they wash? The cast, all the good actors in their own right, do a great job, and it gives you the impression that they had a great time working together, which is quite important in a movie like this. Needless to say, not everything goes according to plan in this movie, both in plot and in humor, but it made me see the special features and consider looking at the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this for a good time, maybe take some friends and a pizza. you will have a good time <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear the unappreciated that Paolo Conte used, and he left me humming fragments of the score long after the credits came out.
