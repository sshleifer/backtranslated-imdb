['This tale based on two pieces by Edgar Allen Poe (&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, &quot;Dance of Death&quot; (poem)) is actually quite spooky from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black and white films about people who are in an old decrepit house (for example, &quot;The cat and the canary&quot;, &quot;The old dark house&quot;, &quot;The night of terror&quot;, etc.). )). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize guests. Die at the beginning of the movie (or not?) And the residents of the house are subject to a series of terrifying experiences. I will not go into too many details here, but it is definitely a must for fans of the old mysteries of dark houses. <br /><br /> Look at it with a lot of popcorn and soda in a dark room. <br /><br /> Dan Basinger 8/10']
