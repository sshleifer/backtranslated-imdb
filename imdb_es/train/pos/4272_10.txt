This is what I call a great movie. Live through the fantastic skills of the actors and a simple but human story. There are real characters that can be fun and dramatic. but the main issue is very cruel, as is living. The bus driver and his son are gathering people across the country (jugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrad. The funny and cruel situations that occur on the road, connect people and pigs that travel together. <br /> <br /> Look at it and you will remember it for life ... it is full of Slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> and another reason for its magic: it's hard to get!
