['If you are a fan of Airplane movies, this is a must see. Set in the 20s and 30s, Johnny Dangerously not only has great actors but big lines. &quot;knock down the data wall, tear down the data wall and tear down the dat # @ $% # @ $ wall&quot;. &quot;You should not hang me on a hook, Johnny&quot; or &quot;It looks like Johnnys is having sex.&quot; It&#39;s definitely a parody of James Cagney&#39;s old movies and he references them to many. There is a big scene when Jhonnys walks down the death row and has a priest ready to escape. Listen carefully to the readings of the false priests, it&#39;s quite fun. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Watch your reaction to Johnny after he gives advice to the Pope, they said many things without making any sound. I recommend this movie to all those who love to laugh or are fans of old movies.']
