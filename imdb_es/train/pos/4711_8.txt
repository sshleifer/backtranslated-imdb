Oh, what fun there is here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has a talent for directing the comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking) but here it seems she told the actors to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton crosses the role of Johnny, easily his best screen performance. Joe Piscopo is great as the proper name of Danny Vermin, what a pity that the directors have not realized this. And I even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary. I do not think it's an accident that most of the character's name will delight MORON. <br /> <br /> Good lines are scattered throughout the film, and Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne. . Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale are put in a good position. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to a friend.
