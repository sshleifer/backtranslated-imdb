"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about domestic pets. It deserves a place among the great films of its kind and even the world of cinema in general, along with other animal films such as "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". This means that it is more than just a movie about pets. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that this is just a "remake"? It's too good to be a "remake"! I know it by heart, from my early teenage years (when I was 12 years old). <br /> <br /> It's a family movie to treasure. It is emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, touching and, at times, dramatic. It is one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this type of film. <br /> <br /> This film does not lack qualities. It has a well-thought story, nice characters, an excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, dazzling landscapes / landscapes of the magnificent mountains of the Sierra (in Oregon). Speaking of views, not everything is mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... In conclusion, all the wonders of pure nature - truly a complete panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human characters are nice, well developed and well represented by the respective actors. Robert Hays is amazing as the good-hearted father, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is just as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is conventional as Jamie's younger and cute brother (his appearance actually reminds me a lot of Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is great as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our quadruped friends, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is the old Golden Retriever loyal, wise, mature, beautiful, affectionate and loving (with a brilliant voice of Don Ameche). Chance, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is carefree, dumb, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play (voiced by the talented Michael J. Fox). Chance can not sit still. Sassy is the epitome of the image of cats: elegant, independent, very confident and proud of himself, with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm. Sassy is a Himalayan cat from Seal Point, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. Sassy is voiced by Sally Field, who also does a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are, themselves, great "actors" by nature: Ben as Shadow, Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassy. <br /> <br /> It's an underestimated movie, but a classic in its own right. Its sequel is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the Top 250.
