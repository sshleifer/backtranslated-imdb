I saw him with my whole family when he was 9 years old in 1964 on our black and white television. I remember that my father commented that "this is how it could have happened: Adam and Eve". I vividly remember the scene when Adam finds Eva, his eyes were blackened. I asked my father why his eyes were blackened and he told me I was tired and hungry. After not having seen this episode in 45 years, I still remember it vividly: the television transmissions back and forth with the home planet, the scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters, the final scene of the two walking away, with Adam carrying his Backpack and Eve later. . It may not have been a work of theatrical art, but it certainly left an impression on me all these years.
