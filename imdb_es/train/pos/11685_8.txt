['I found this movie very funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to Earth in a white male body from the mid-50s. He does not realize that his behavior must change and he continues acting as he had before. Listen to rap music, sing and play the stereotyped part of an urban black man. The real humor in this movie was to observe the problems in which this behavior puts him in the black community.']
