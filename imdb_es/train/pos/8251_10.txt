And this someone is me. And not only me, as I can see here in IMDb or when leaving the theater. Why do people love him? It's obvious: everyone already knows zombies (at least memory Horror fans and others through the reinvention of "Dawn of the Dead" or Resident Evil movies, etc.) <br /> <br / > Or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... that's until this movie appeared. And you will see zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror movie, although it contains some violent scenes, but rather it is a comedy. A satire to be precise. And it never runs out of steam! That's why I rate it so high. The pace is incredible, the performance is excellent and the script has no errors (obvious) ... quite the opposite: it is a gem and if you are only a little interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you do not like them, look at them! Because it's a great movie (comedy)!
