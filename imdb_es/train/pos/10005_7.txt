Yes, it's an art ... make a slow-paced thriller. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in pleasant volumes while you do not even realize what is happening. <br /> <br /> Good performance Robin Williams. The angles of sexuality in the film may seem unnecessary and can probably affect the way you enjoy the movie. However, the central plot is very attractive. The film does not rush towards you and it still grabs you enough to keep you thinking. The address is good. The use of lights to achieve the desired effects of suspense and the unexpected is good. <br /> <br /> Very nice 1 time, see if you want to rest and listen to an exciting story.
