This is one of those films that explore the cultural shock of people born in the east in westernized cultures. <br /> <br /> Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to the great cultural differences. Ken, a rock n'roll fan, marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so she can stay in the United States when her visa expires. The marriage is only expected to be temporary, that is, until Kyoto obtains legal status again. But, Ken, who seems to be lost in all relationships, likes Kyoto and strives to make things work. This, despite his friend's insistence that getting rid of Kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock and roll, except to inspire some songs about broken hearts and all that. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese education, and does not expect to be married to Ken for so long. Not only that, she feels nostalgic and wants to return to Japan. It's sad that she's finally someone with whom Ken believes she can love and be with all of that, except the only time she thinks she found someone to feel that way, the girl does not expect to stay that long. It's not that he does not like Ken, it's just that he's used to a totally different way of life. She says: "I can not tell you how I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a pretty sad love story with a killer techno-nintendo soundtrack from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I chose Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite movies of the 80s, Tokyo Pop. And , for those of you who enjoyed Loving on Tokyo Time, take a look at Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese Japanese cover band), except that it is a movie with a happy ending. <br /> <br />
