['The most satisfying element of &quot;Dan in real life&quot; is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. Choosing Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as Dan&#39;s love interest was an excellent decision; She is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank God, suitably aged for the role! If this movie had been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. <br /><br /> Another wonderful aspect of &quot;Dan in real life&quot; is that it is a perfect movie for adults interested in a mature comedy that omits the three pillars of the &quot;fraternity pack&quot; formula: stupid chicks, chauvinistic boys and shoddy jokes. &quot;Dan in real life&quot; is witty and has fun and intelligent laughs at all times. While other comedies incorporate or are based almost entirely on jokes that surprise the audience and laugh, the jokes of &quot;Dan in real life&quot; are more natural and intelligent, and involve some reflections on the part of the audience. <br /><br /> My only problem with &quot;Dan in real life&quot; is that the actress Brittany Robertson plays the rebellious middle daughter. It is difficult to say if this was a personal choice on your part or a choice of the director. Either way, your character is unrealistic and annoying. But, this is just a minor flaw in the movie, and it does not take away the whole story. <br /><br /> In short, &quot;Dan in real life&quot; is a great movie, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and meaningless comedies. The quality of the writing, direction, acting and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, happy comedy.']
