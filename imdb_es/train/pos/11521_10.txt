Wizards are a wonderful journey from beginning to end, thanks in large part to the magic that the stars generate. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades. Like any really good movie, it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming. I can not believe that this movie is SO hard to find: I would buy it on a DVD in the blink of an eye but I still have to find a way out.
