Dr. Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool. Suddenly he discovers that his wife is kissing with the manager of the pool. He realizes that behind everything clean, there is decay. He starts torturing his patients. ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist; It is completely credible. Surprisingly there is little blood, but the scenes of dental torture are quite unpleasant and grotesque. Highly recommended "Dentist 2" is also worth a visit!
