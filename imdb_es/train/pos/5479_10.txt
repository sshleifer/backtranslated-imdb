['<br /><br /> Arriving in a car in New York City, the clever young BABY FACE begins to methodically make her way to the upper floors of power in a large bank. <br /><br /> Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre-Code drama. Without a hint of decency or repentance, he coldly manipulates the elimination or destruction of men with the bad luck of being in his way. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has full opportunity here to show her extensive talents. <br /><br /> Appearing fairly late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition as the possible companion capable of handling Stanwyck; his sophisticated acting style makes a good counterpoint to his cold attitude. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker portray a succession of their unfortunate victims. <br /><br /> John Wayne appears for only a few seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for Stanwyck&#39;s affections. This would be the only time these two artists appeared together on the screen. <br /><br /> Film experts must recognize Nat Pendleton as a clandestine customer, and Charles Sellon and Edward Van Sloan as bank executives, all unbilled. <br /><br /> The music that is heard in the soundtrack throughout the film, which perfectly highlights the plot, is&#39; Baby Face &#39;(1926) by Benny Davis &amp; Harry Akst and&#39; St. Louis Blues&#39; (1914) by WC Handy. <br /><br /> BABY FACE is an excellent example of badness prior to the Code. In its frank relationship with sex, without apology, it is precisely the kind of film that the implementation of the Production Code in 1934 should eliminate.']
