I saw the movie in a preview and I really loved it. The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious. Another highlight of the film is, without doubt, the music, which we hope will be released soon. I recommend it to everyone who likes British humor and especially all musicians. Go and look. It's great.
