I really liked this movie. I saw the original classic several times, but I could barely remember any details. I think this movie is much better than the cartoon, it is not as black and white as this one. I especially liked how they made the grinch so complete and explained why it was so, the villain of this movie was not the real Grinch, but the Major, very different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was perfect for the part in general, a great movie made for children and adults alike.
