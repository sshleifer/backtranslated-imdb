I was a kid ... crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance ... He was and is the greatest of all time. A few days ago, a friend gave me a DVD of "Moonwalker" ... I could not believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again ... After many years, and that made me go back in time. Almost cry. Not for Michael Jackson but for the good old days that I remembered when I went to their concerts, enjoying the music and dancing. The film gave me a different perspective from when I was a child. You can really see the parody that Michael went through his life. Thanks Michael Jackson for bringing me back to those great moments, to Your great music and dance. It is a pity that people have forgotten you. I did not do it because you gave me great moments with your music. All the best for you wherever you are.
