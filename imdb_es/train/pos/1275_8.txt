I found this movie to be lovely. I thought the characters developed because while watching, I found myself worrying about these people. This is a period article that I believe took place during the depression. A single mother, who is known as the inmate of the city (she has reason to be), puts an ad in the newspaper for "a husband". Christopher Reeve plays an ex-convict who goes through the city in search of work. He sees the ad and goes out to see it. She hires him. I really had some laughs as their relationship progresses because it was easy for me to put myself in their shoes. Everything went on like that, in fact. He needs the work so as not to disturb her. And she needs your help, but she does not want him to take the lead. They dance around the fact that they really start to need each other. Things start to heat up ... the big bang. I will not spoil it by telling you what happens. But the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful. I thought the story is very believable by the time it takes place. I think this is one of the best "relationship" stories out there. Maybe the younger generation does not "understand" him, but if he's over 40, I think he'll like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time", you will also like it in this one.
