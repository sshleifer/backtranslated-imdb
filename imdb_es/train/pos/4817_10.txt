The Young Victoria is a beautiful film and has presented Queen Victoria in a different way than everyone thinks of her. The films erase the impression of "I do not have fun" of the queen Victoria and demonstrate that she was a happy young woman. <br /> <br /> As I love history, particularly Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw it. This movie announced, I was so excited and counted the days until I hit theaters. I was a little worried that it was not historically true, but it was and I loved it. I discovered new facts about Queen Victoria that they did not know before and I was very interested. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria in many lights was one of our greatest monarchs of all time, and this film paints a picture of her The true personality and what her life was like. She was treated so badly by her mother's advisor, Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to have a regency. This was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic queen, what she was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep and this was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, both brilliant! The Young Victoria is a love story felt in the heart, but at the same time it is a great look at an important part of British history ... 10/10 ... without a doubt!
