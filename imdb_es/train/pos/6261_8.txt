Fantastic documentary of 1924. This geography of the early twentieth century in Iraq today was powerful. Look at this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not take notes before making his Ten Commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer, later created Cinerama, an idea that probably arose during the filming of the remarkable landscapes of this film. Werner Herzog fans will find that this film is a treasure, with heartbreaking tales of struggle, complemented by the earth that surrounds them, the human capacity to endure has never been so evident. The fact that this was done when it was demonstrated not only shows the will of the subjects, but also of the filmmakers themselves.
