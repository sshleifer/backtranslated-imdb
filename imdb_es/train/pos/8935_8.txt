"The Intruder (L'Intrus)" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. <br /> <br /> Grizzled Michel Subor plays "Louis Trebor" as Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past, living simply in a secluded hut in the woods for justly paranoid reasons (but attracting young and pretty women who they can be useful for him). We learn more about him through dreams, flashbacks and a journey that can unfold chronologically or not, as well as through his abrupt interactions with family, lovers, business partners and a surprising nemesis. As "The Limey", the film resonates with regrets of parents / children and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old movie with the same actor as a young man (here, the adventure movie "Le Reflux" by Paul Gégauff in 1965). <br /> <br /> In a complete contrast of moods, we find her son Sidney (Grégoire Colin), who has to be the husband of the sexiest house in the world, while doing domestic repairs in a sweet way and seductive and caring for a baby, a small child and all children. Need for your hard-working wife. Surely the director and co-author Claire Denis should have created it as a woman's fantasy, if ever there was one and a lesson for other filmmakers about how to shoot the preliminary games. There is an extended extended scene in which he searches for his father in the forest while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a bag. He is everything that his father is not and has all the relationships that his father is unable to sustain; No wonder he thinks his father is "a lunatic." I spent the rest of the movie afraid that something bad would happen to him, since the true nature of his alienated father's heart is played little by little before our eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie is a puzzle. but Subor is ruthlessly fascinating when we see him traverse countries and negotiate infamous deals, and Denis' "Beau Travail" aloud was annoying anyway. We have to discover, from the horizons and incidental signage, that you are traveling to Geneva, Korea and the South Pacific. The passage of time is indicated by the changing seasons and the scars that are created and heal. There are many images of water for cleaning and distancing. <br /> <br /> Continuing his fascination with the transformation of colonialism into globalization, in addition to playing a little with the stereotypes of the Mysterious East and Russian criminals, Denis has incorporated elements of Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando in Tahiti. Idyll and a 40-page memory of the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, the latest for the title and plot of heart transplantation used for an ironic theme of limited immortality that has consequences. <br /> <br /> While "Louis" believes that he has succeeded in being above the limits, rules and morals, there is some fun in the last act, since the locals do not know what to do with him and they try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey, even when he is isolated again. . <br /> <br /> Several people in the audience were frustrated by the elliptical but surprisingly beautiful method of telling stories. The unconventional narrative raises many questions of the plot about the details.
