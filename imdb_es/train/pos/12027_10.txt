['I&#39;ve seen it and I like Melissa plays her role well. Actually, it was credible. My brother-in-law saw him with my sister and me, and when I mentioned to my sister that I forgot that it was based on a real story (I had seen it a few years ago). He said that just because he&#39;s alive, you think it&#39;s true. and both my sister and I were like that, anyway I was wondering if anyone knew what the murder was or who was really involved because he wanted to prove it to him. I love movies for life, especially those that are true, or just those that teach a good lesson. I thought I had seen something about it a week ago, but I do not remember where any help would be appreciated.']
