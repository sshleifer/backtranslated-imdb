For starters, it's a very funny movie with some crazy running characters that are meant to make you laugh (check out the two Russian bugs). <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life has a classic Disney story, but that's one of the good things about the movie. Family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film experience some evolution to face the grasshoppers at the end. And he also has a couple of great voices on Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course), ... But in reality, the most surprising thing about this movie is the animation. It is simply wonderful. All the details, excellent colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds ... And the Pixar boys and girls made everything look so realistic. In short, a very good work. This is the best Disney animation from Aladdin.
