A strange but emotionally unsettling cooler about a middle-aged man (William H. Macy) who finally decides to leave the family business (commissioned murder) led by his silently exaggerated father (Donald Sutherland) while watching a shrink (John Ritter) and flirting with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about a big dilemma, but "Panic" is a top-notch thriller that looks like "American Beauty" and "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland are the highlights here. Notable debut for the first writer / writer Henry Bromell. I'm surprised that this movie has not had the chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks.
