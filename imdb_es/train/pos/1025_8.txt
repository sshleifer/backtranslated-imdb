My rating refers to the first 4 Stargate SG-1 stations that are wonderfully fresh, creative and addictive. When the plaster went through the door, you never knew what was on the other side! Beginning around Season 5, the program took a different approach: it's still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and an extraterrestrial) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the "Stargate". The background story of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt. <br /> <br /> The episodes are light (innocent and easy to see) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily have become great science fiction films of their own. What happens next was always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The characters on which the program is based are also well defined and performed brilliantly. His tone is serious, but the dialogue is flourishing with incredible wit and humor. They are simply fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Starting somewhere around season 5, the series began to evolve into a continuous story based on the fight against a single enemy (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The frames become more complex (much more oriented to policies / strategies) and interdependent. The characters were still as great as ever, but the show was of a different nature. <br /> <br /> One thing that needs to be mentioned is watching the episodes that commemorated episodes 100 and 200. They are simply shows you can not miss. They exhibit the creative and tremendously humorous genius that led to the series over 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a science fiction fan, watch some episodes of the first 4 Seasons and you're probably hooked. If you like the evolution of the story lines between two opposite sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to wait.
