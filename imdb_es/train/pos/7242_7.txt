1933 seemed to be a great year for satires ("Duck Soup", for example) and this fits well, although it is about the obsession with the contract contract. The tone is like a comic piece by The New Yorker, appropriate, since the film begins with the page "Goings On About Town" of that magazine. The only strange thing is the casting. A few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. However, after 1934, you would not have handled adultery in such a sophisticated way, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in elegant clothes or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on the radio. Even if you do not know anything about the bridge, you may want to see a rare example of Hollywood satire.
