I think I'll never understand hate for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was great, and it gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most impressive action movies in history. That's right, little punks, the rules of 'Cliffhanger', and we all know it. <br /> <br /> Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue climber who is "just visiting" his old town when asked for help. an old friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), attends a rescue on the top of a mountain. Walker obviously came back at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. they have lost a lot of money that they stole from the United States government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they would really like to get it back ... Essentially, Cliffhanger is another clone of 'Die Hard '. Simply change the confines of Nakatomi Square to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, with scenes created to point out our hero's weaknesses and keep him deadly. Naturally, the configuration breaks into pieces very soon, as Stallone's character avoids a large number of bullets with ease, and hits several faces of rock face-to-face without apparent side effects. After all, is not that what action movies are about? <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies that exist. A showcase of great scenes and acrobatics. One of the first stunts is one of the best acrobatics I've seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie is not better than at first, it maintains its action genius. The main villain of John Lithgow is entertaining and a bad guy. Possibly one of the best leading villains in history. <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely Renny Harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie: 9/10
