The cult film for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, especially acting: it is beyond any praise. The film, like the book, is full of symbols: my favorite is the most brilliant symbol of Razrukha (Russian colloquial word for "devastation", often means the period of chaos in the lifestyle after the Civil War of 1918- 2020). <br /> <br /> Now, the film is released on DVD with a fully restored image and 5.1 sound, there are also well translated English subtitles, although some obscure words by Sharikov were replaced by the softer versions in the translation . I do not know if that DVD is available abroad, but if you find it, change it immediately, it's really worth seeing. <br /> <br /> And, in conclusion, one fact: about 50% of Russians today. , mostly young, can identify themselves as Sharikovs to a considerable degree. It's the post-Soviet effect: the Soviets seemed totally unprepared for the information attack of Western civilization, television producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media surprisingly aggressive, soulless and thoughtless to incite the darkest instincts of every Russian. Even among Internet users, every third uses obscene language in forums and chats because it is surprisingly common in colloquial speech.
