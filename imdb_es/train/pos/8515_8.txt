The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, who I like about previous films. The film was a great family movie, nothing that makes him worry about showing it to younger children, a good story, lots of laughs, happy and pleasant. If you want to entertain children without getting bored to tears, this fits the bill. It pleases children, and it is not difficult for parents to look either.
