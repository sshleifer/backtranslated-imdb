['Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. When she is overworked at work, she can hire Paul to help her. Paul has just come out of prison, and his past is not completely behind him. To say much more about history, which has many twists, would be a mistake. <br /><br /> The most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear and when not, a kind of &quot;listening point&quot; (like the point of view). The first scenes that shaped this, as well as the early development of Carla and Paul&#39;s character, were more interesting to me than the subsequent twists and turns, some of which were difficult to follow and / or stretched the credibility a bit. There is also some unpleasant violence. Back on the positive side, the cinematography was very good. <br /><br /> It&#39;s worth watching the movie, but maybe they will not look for it. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 04/28/2002.']
