['I&#39;m sorry, I do not have a lot of time to write. I&#39;m not a psychologist but I&#39;ve known her for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson played a sociopath (without conscience) extraordinarily well. I agree! He also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had conscience but could not control himself superbly. I agree! What a scary and tremendous movie. I have seen more than 2000 movies and I would rank it among the top 100. My lifelong friend deals with clients like these regularly. My only criticism was the narration of the preaching at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances, but only one in a million will behave like these two losers did.']
