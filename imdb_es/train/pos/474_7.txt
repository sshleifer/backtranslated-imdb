Having not read Nabokov and not knowing anything about chess, he could only watch "The Luzhin Defense" as a movie. <br /> <br /> It works very well as one of my favorite genres "sports romances". Chess comes alive as a tough competition, much more than in one, says "Looking for Bobby Fischer", by showing how much mental work the game can do, which requires reflection, preparation, endurance and planning. I particularly liked the special effects on the chessboard as alternative plays are anticipated. <br /> <br /> Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris (from "Antonia"), Emily Watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens herself through her transforming relationship. with the intense chess genius, quite distracted from a single note by John Turturro. <br /> <br /> The stages in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/27/2001)
