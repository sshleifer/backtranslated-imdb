Purple Rain is a great movie if you are a music lover of over 40 years who participated in the music of Prince in the eighties. History is a widely used formula: rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find its audience and its self-esteem. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially from Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U, makes it worthwhile to sit through the movie. He is himself and as a showman, as powerful on stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, around Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, a former protege of Prince, is beautiful and shows some talent and chemistry acting with Prince, but her script does not let her go far. Morris Day and other supporting actors provide comic elements.
