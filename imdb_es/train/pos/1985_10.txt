Normally I am not a lover of musicals, but if I had to choose which one would be my favorite, it would definitely be Oliver. This film is very well made, the characters are well represented, the costumes are successful in the acting is good and the songs are great, my favorite being is 'Reviewing The Situation', by Ron Moody, who presents a brilliant portrait of Fagin I was not old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late '60s, but my sisters did, so for weeks. I had to put up with them singing the bloody songs, it was usually "Who will buy my wonderful roses". I already knew all the songs before watching the movie. It's a timeless musical that you definitely could not remake. it stands on its own It is not accurate for the book and I do not think it would have worked as well if it had been. I do not think Charles Dickens was disappointed, since he wrote to Oliver to describe poverty in London. The orphanages, the workplaces and what the poor had to resort to survive, and the film portrays is very good. Also another great reason to watch this movie is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier, notice his long and thin legs, this was bred out of breed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him, and he it's exactly what an English Bull Terrier would look like in Victorian times. Realizing he has scars (which are probably makeup) on his face, Bill Sykes probably used it for dog fights or for the rat pit. A Victorian Terrier bull had a record number of deaths in a rat pit. He's a beautiful dog anyway, and I notice that he disobeys Bill Sykes after he killed Nancy, obviously he has his standards that he's not the crap that Bill Sykes thought he was. A great musical to see if you like musicals, and if you do not like musicals, try it somehow, there is something for everyone in this movie.
