Corbin Bernsen offers an extraordinarily intense and fascinating performance as Dr. Alan Feinstone, a rich and successful Beverly Hills dentist who is obsessed with perfection. When he discovers that his charming blond trophy wife has been cheating on him and the IRS begins to harass him because of tax problems, Feinstone yields under pressure and goes wildly around the curve. Director Brian Yuzna, who works with a suitably obscure, witty and demented script by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli and Charles Finch, exposes the neurosis and psychosis that sprout beneath the well-maintained and well-groomed surface of respectable and rich America with malicious delicacy. In addition, Yuzna spices even more the grisly events with a perversely twisted sense of black gallows humor. Bernsen shines positively as Dr. Feinstone; He expertly projects a truly disconcerting underlying chill that is just below Feinstone's apparently calm and confident appearance. The cast of support is also excellent: Linda Hoffman as the evil and infidel wife of Feinstone, Brooke, Earl Boen, as IRS agent, Marly Goldblum, Molly Hagan as assistant, Jessica, Patty Toy, assistant Karen, Jan Hoag, manager of office, Candy, Virginya Keehne as the sweet and lanky teenager Sarah, Ken Foree as thorough, sensible Detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as the equally astute Gibbs detective, Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as the womanizer of muffins, pool cleaner , Matt, and Mark Ruffalo, in the fight. Landers. The first class makeup f / x are as bloody, disgusting and annoying as they should be. The polished cinematography of Levie Isaaks has a lot of great angles of inclined camera and some tasty approaches with zoom approach. Alan Howarth's shaky score also hits the crawl site of the meat. A pleasantly warped treat.
