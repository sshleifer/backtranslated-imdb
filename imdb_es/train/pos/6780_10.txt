Colman's performance is helped by the brilliantly written script. The gigantic Hollywood studios of the 30s and 40s were able to copy some of the elements of German expressionist cinema and incorporate them into Hollywood films. Very good use of shadows and light and silhouette. I really liked the scene in which Colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film, and begins to recite Othello while his face becomes instantly dark and evil. Already the viewer sees the text and drama of Shakespeare when he gets "Tony" and goes on his journey of doom. I also enjoyed the dramatic scene of death within the play, when he becomes excited with emotion and accidentally strangles his partner a little too hard to bear for her. His pleas "Tony Stop You're Hurting Me" are creepy and suspenseful. you just do not know if he will go over and kill you at any time. The pursuit of the cat and mouse to reveal the killer was added very well 2/3 of the way through the film to add a faster pace and also to add to the narrative element of the film. Masterpiece by George Cukor. It's like a skilled director. Excellent movie. Too bad they do not do them like they used to ...
