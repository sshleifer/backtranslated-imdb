This is one of those movies that I've seen so many times that I can cite most of them. Some of the lines in this movie are simply unbeatable. I particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while I'm drunk, I go to the drunken elegant restaurant and part with the moose. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I've seen this sequence but it's fun every hour. From the moment Arthur arrives at Susan's parents' place to the moose bite, you laugh a lot the whole time. I remember seeing the results regarding the drill with the moose. He fell just as he had imagined. Everyone was laughing so hard that it was difficult for them to film him. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. His behavior, his simple phrases and the way he handled Arthur were equally funny. It is always a fun time when he hits him on the head with his hat or tells him that he is a little ____ pampered. I laugh every time I hear "I'm going to bathe" and the lines that follow.
