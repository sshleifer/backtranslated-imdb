['Glacier Fox is one of the most wonderful and photographed wildlife movies in history. <br /><br /> The film makes you worry about every member of this family of foxes, from the blind puppy to the strongest: their adventures are sometimes funny and also tragic. In contrast to an inhospitable field, the hearts of the audience are warm for family members. <br /><br /> The score and the lyrics of the music tell the story interspersed with the narration about what is happening in general terms. <br /><br /> Man remains one of the greatest predators, but we have no doubt that foxes are capable of living, not just surviving beyond human efforts.']
