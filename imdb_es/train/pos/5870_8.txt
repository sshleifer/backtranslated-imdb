JACKNIFE is an excellent adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's play 'Strange Snow' (the script was also written by Metcalfe), directed with sensitivity by David Hugh Jones, who explores the often forgotten effect of the battle on veterans permanently damaged by atrocious cruelties of war. It is especially moving to return to this 1989 film now, when we see the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the crude treatment they receive in our veterans' hospitals. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam War together and only two came back alive: the problem is that while both men suffered in battle, David's 'Highschool' Flannigan (Ed Harris) is so badly damaged for the post-traumatic stress syndrome that 'exists' in a drunken vacuum with her simple school teacher Martha (Kathy Baker). While David deteriorates, his friend Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the city in an attempt to help his friend. In the course of events, Jacknife at first offers relief to Martha and, finally, to both appointments, at a prom that Martha must attend, and at that prom, David falls apart completely, destroying relics in school and terrorizing the people of the city and the students. Jacknife makes Dave relive the moment in Vietnam when they lost their partner and, in doing so, takes David to the point where he can begin his ascent to recovery. And patient Martha also finds her needs met by Jacknife. <br /> <br /> The three actors give amazingly excellent presentations: Ed Harris offers one of his most complete roles, while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards. Established by their careers. More people should help resuscitate this almost forgotten film, as it is a fragile reminder of the damage our wars cause to the men who fight them and to the families who receive them after the end of the battle. Highly recommended Harp grady
