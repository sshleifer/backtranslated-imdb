I just saw this for the first time in a long time; I had forgotten how imaginative the images were and how ingenious the film is. However, I had not forgotten the opening scenes (with the scene at the Candlelight Club on the Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in politics or history will love the direct references of the film: Hunter-Niven will move anyone interested in romance, and anyone who loves visual images will enjoy the representation of the another world. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie is still "Odd Man Out" made almost at the same time, but this one is excellent <br /> <br />
