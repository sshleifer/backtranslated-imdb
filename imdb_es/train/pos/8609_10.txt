I thought that this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It was a great story and it showed that people are so intricate in all kinds of different ways. I have recommended it to all my friends !! I always enjoy a good story and this movie had one of the best I've seen in a long time. I could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that Natalie did to discover more about her life and her loves. It showed how we not only have lives with our families; but we also have parts of our lives that we do not share with them, since it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of the things we do not do that we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another of those films, and I will keep an eye on them.
