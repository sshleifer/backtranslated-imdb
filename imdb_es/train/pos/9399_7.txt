This is a movie that I saw when it first came out, and that I've seen a few times over the years. It is always nice. <br /> <br /> One thing is that comedy does not take sides: it affects workers and capitalists alike. Only Sid seems to be out of the classic fight, even though he is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning: do not read more if you have not seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, although it is presented quite plausibly. Ask yourself: could someone support most of their weight in a single strand of cloth? It would cut through almost any support. <br /> <br /> Also, when cornered in an alley, Sid uses a covered garbage can as a knight's shield. Cute symbolism. <br /> <br /> Someday, I'll get this on DVD.
