Channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty things than any of the other channels, this program was certainly a bad one. The presenter of this sometimes-gross adult chat program, four-time BAFTA winner and British Comedy Award winner (also twice nominated) Graham Norton was the perfect gay host for a good show like this. I had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it. Basically, they had an adult idea that would be crude, humiliating or humorous for the guest, but some are not for the faint-hearted. They had women playing the recorder with their parts, men who used their cocks to play a xylophone, women who went up in the bathroom, men with or without pants under their kilts, and many more rude but funny ideas. This is for adults only, but enjoy it! Won the BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (Program or Series), won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), Best Comedy Show, won an Emmy for episode # 18 (?), And He won the national television awards twice for the most popular talk show. It was number 52 in The 100 best fun moments. Very well!
