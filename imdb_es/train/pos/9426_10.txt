This is one of the funniest series in history! I laughed until my sides split and I rolled on the floor. If only someone launches it in america. Region 0 or 1 - No PAL, please. <br /> <br /> I know it will be released in the UK, but that's Region 2 and PAL as well! We are going to give this series its good shake. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved the peculiar and silly role of Tracie Bennett in this. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Start this program in America! o Show again on PBS stations. I have to laugh and laugh again! Please, please, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
