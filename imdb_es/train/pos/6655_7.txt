It's one of the best Indian films I've seen lately, instead of songs and dances of shit or slums. All actors have shown the correct emotions at the correct intensity with the correct timing. It is the hallmark of a good movie, which makes the viewer come back and investigate the subject, which is exactly what I did when controlling Harilal. I always enjoy the subtle acting style of Akshay Khanna and, interestingly, he had a rather complicated relationship with his own father Vinod Khanna, although not as dramatic as Gandhis and I wonder how he helped him rehearse this character. I was impressed by the direction and two thumbs up by Anil Kapoor for producing such an elegant movie.
