To be honest with you, I think everything was so good in this movie that there should not be any reason why you have not entered the theaters. The deaths in the movie are amazing. The images are impressive when they are used. There are some boring moments in which the story follows the girl, but in general this was a very good movie that I hope will one day get the accessories that it should. The first part of the movie is probably the reason why he came directly to the video with them killing a child, but after that The story is based on a girl and her mother who came to visit the boyfriend of the mother who moved to try to become a writer. The property he buys is where the witch (Tooth Fairy) lives and whoever lives in his house. or going to your property will be in great danger. I do not want to give anything, just a little information, if you wanted to see this movie, then do it. It is worth paying the rental price.
