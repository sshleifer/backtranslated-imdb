Dark comedy Gallows humor? How do you make a murder comedy? It can be a risky business since the spectator must abandon their moral values ​​and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people. So, the story has been solid as a rock with a good bit of suspended reality to make it work. Therefore, Pierce Brosnan, the Irishman's response to 007, now presents himself as an alcoholic, chain-smoking sex addict who kills people for a living and has a crisis in his life. Meet a troubled businessman, Greg Kinnear, and after a difficult start, he finds out he needs a friend. But, Greg is happily married to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things he does not have, love, home and life. Add the character actor, Philip Baker Hall as the hired manager and we go to the races. Brosnan is wonderfully coarse and rude as the antihero and charming Kinnear as his counterpart, the very human businessman. Hope Davis adds a twinkle to Kinnear's very conventional wife, who is fascinated by this abandoned one that goes deep into their lives. The ending is delicious and with some surprise. He should leave the theater, at least, partly well, if he can suspend the horror of killing people.
