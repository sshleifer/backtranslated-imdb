['A success at that time, but now better classified as an Australian cult movie. The humor is broad, not very subtle and, in the final scene where the fire of a BBC studio is extinguished when urinating on it, it is raw. It contains almost all the clichés about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to &quot;the old country,&quot; and all the clichés about those rapacious, twisted, plaintive, Tory Brits. It would be acceptable to the British because of its strong cast of well-known actors, and for the Australians of that generation, who can &quot;get&quot; the humor. Americans - forget it. The language and jokes are in the Australian dialect of English and, as such, will be unintelligible.']
