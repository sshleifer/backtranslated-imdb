Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com movie database. After watching this movie, you may think that Duvall's appearance is reincarnation at its best. One of my favorite movies. I wish the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick had a CD or there was a soundtrack available. Wonderful landscapes, music and "all too faithful to life", especially for those of us who live or have moved to the South. This is a "real moment in time". Life advances, slowly, but "strangers do not stay".
