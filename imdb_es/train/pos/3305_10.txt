Undoubtedly, this film has to be one of the biggest ........ in film history. I've seen it too many times to remember it, and each time it's like I'm watching the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where does one start? <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari's center Performance is undoubtedly one of the best of her career, followed closely by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar. Every movement and nuance of his performance makes any other Bollywood heroine matter. His masterful interpretation of Kathak along with his grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of Urdhu, is like never seen on the Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; Photography, sumptuous cinematography and the scene on stage are so loaded with symbolism and meaning, that the spectator is breathless. <br /> <br /> The music of Naushads, is second to none, his knowledge of the music of the gharanas courtesan is incredible, and the way in which he narrates the narrative with dark atmospheric motives and overwhelming romantic melodies is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> My only advice for anyone seriously enjoying the total movie show, you should see this epic mediation.
