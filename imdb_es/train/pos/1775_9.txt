I often wonder why this series was criticized so much. I thought it was brilliant and also very skillfully written and done. I think that in the future it will be seen what it deserves, that is, if it is ever issued. Many new and young comedy actors appeared in this and everyone went to bigger things. Maybe this fact will make people aware of their value and that should be issued. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and, above all, Julian Rhind-Tutt, from the successful Green Wing. The writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comedy writers of the modern era. Anyone who can produce comedy like Father Ted could not be able to write something that is not worth publishing. If it is ever issued, I will certainly buy it.
