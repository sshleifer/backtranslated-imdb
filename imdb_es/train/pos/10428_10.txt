Amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring, but it is delivered with a subtlety and an incredible performance that I have always lost the hope of finding. Instead of relying on clich√©s and too dramatized moments, the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect, so relating to them as people you might know is easy. The film is not about making people laugh, or about pushing an ideal to the audience, but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance. <br /> <br /> Now I'm restless waiting for the weekend to see the sequel. A touching, provocative, fun look at love that I think should be an absolute romantic classic with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. It will soften even the hardest heart.
