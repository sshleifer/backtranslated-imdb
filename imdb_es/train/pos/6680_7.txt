This was different, that's for sure. Just watch the cast! Talk about strange bugs. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, although a group of actors almost share the limelight, in this farce about the superheroes-aspirants. Paul Reubens played the most outrageous of the fame of "Pee Wee Herman". <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor, bright colors and nothing of calm. It is a very entertaining and light comedy with nothing more than silly characters, all of whom want to be heroes like Superman, Batman, Spiderman, your name. However, they have talents in strange areas that true heroes do not have (and do not want!). It's silly, but you know what's happening. <br /> <br /> It is also a movie that you can see in installments and really do not miss any continuity. It's a long movie for one so hectic, so taking a break here and there is fine. The language was docile so that the children could also enjoy this. In fact, I do not remember to have insulted here, except the guy in the theater who was next to me and who kept saying: "What a silly movie, e ...". I thought it was fun two hours, but I would prefer to watch it on a DVD and take some breaks.
