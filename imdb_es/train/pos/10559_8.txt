I have not written a review on IMDb for a long time, however, I felt compelled to write this! When searching for this movie, I found a particular review that urged people NOT to watch this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant! NOTHING is a fantastic movie, full of laughs and above all ... imagination! Are not you sick and tired of being fed by the force of the same cycle of chewing gum films? Sometimes, a movie like NADA appears and offers you something you've never seen before. I do not even care if you dislike (you even hate) the movie, but nobody has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a monumental impact on reputation and no negative criticism should discredit the film in that way. Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but do not try to tell people that they should not see it. We have our own minds and we will make our own decisions thanks. <br /> <br /> If my criteria are good, I would say that more people will enjoy this movie instead of those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Give your mind a sweet touch! See nothing!
