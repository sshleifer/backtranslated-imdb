From time to time, a filmmaker gives life to a unique group of people and lets you in to see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did this again. I always felt that the Bg Cill was the anthem of his age and he has managed to do it again in the Grand Canyon. Every once in a while we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and, often, we spoil it. This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life thanks to that choice. The juxtaposition of small and large events that allow us to see how basically trivial the things we care about are really great. I have seen this movie several times and I am greatly surprised by the depth of emotions that run through this film. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline fulfill their roles with great tenderness and Stever Martins' representation of a film executive is priceless. Thanks again Mr. Kasden
