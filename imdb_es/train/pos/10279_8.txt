The wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and feels bad for her profession and feels it is useless to help her patients. A young customer addicted to betting asks you to help him pay his debts if he really wants to help him improve. Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna. Revealing more of the plot would spoil a very funny movie and 'House of Games' could be the best scam I've seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem that is full of quick dialogues, excellent phrases and enough turns to keep guessing until the end. Crouse is perfect as the tense psychiatrist who needs a change and Mantegna heads it as the devilishly clever swindler. And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the film, the film has absolute control of its audience; and we are loving the scam. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
