A true classic, ten out of ten! Each actor is perfect, the script is a disturbing sequence of suspense scenes. Car scenes and scenes in the mountains are impressive. I wonder if this movie is already available on DVD, because it should be seen in the widescreen version. I saw this movie in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never since I forgot it. I remember that it was one of the first Warner films, like the Warnerscope system, which gave a very clear cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I could criticize is not being directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to increase his pace and tension.
