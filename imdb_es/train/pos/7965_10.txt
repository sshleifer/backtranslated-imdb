['This movie was amazing ... it made me laugh, it made a scream and, above all, it has animals that talk! This movie should be seen by all kinds of people! It&#39;s one of my favorite movies, and I love it so much that I had to comment on it !!! rox! It is so heartfelt and a wonderful story that makes a great and sincere movie. My favorite character is the shadow. This is because I think it is the most interesting and charming. I used to have a golden retriever like the shadow, I miss it a lot !!! He was my best friend and I knew that when he died, he would be in a happier place, but I miss him with all my heart! This movie is the best, I love it and everyone should! Love your pets no matter what they do, take care of them forever!']
