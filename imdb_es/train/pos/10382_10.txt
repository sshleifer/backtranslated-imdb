As with all other critics, this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. I remember going to the library investigating everything I could about this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. Despite all this, all I could discover was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s. <br /> <br /> Progress until 2002, after years of searching on eBay weekly . Base and there it was, a VHS copy of the movie. There was another bidder, but I was determined to win this movie. The losing bidder wrote to me asking for a copy I gave him. Despite having a copy, I kept looking and finally found a site that would sell a DVD copy of the movie. You can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
