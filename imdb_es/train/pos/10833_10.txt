This movie made me cry at the end! I see at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen lots of great movies, even more trash. But when I finished the scene, catarsic in its essence, I came to mourn! And if you did not, you have serious problems! The story is archetypal, nothing new or original. But it's real, because that kind of thing really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my type of music, but I really admire everything that happened in the early 70s. At some point this was directed to Velvet Goldmine! The docudramas really never work very well. But this movie really helped us believe everything ... Because they do not try to do it like a road full of glorious concerts, current musicians who are superheroes, groupie girls who are stupid and emotionally numb, do not glorify drugs and alcohol, promote rehabilitation and the redemption that comes even 20 years late ... Once again, a great movie. Since "Leaving Las Vegas" I was never so moved by a movie.
