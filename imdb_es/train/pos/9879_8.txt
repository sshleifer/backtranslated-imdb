['The presentation of Lily Mars may have provided Judy Garland with one of the easiest roles she had while at MGM because Lily Mars is definitely a character she could identify with. A young woman with enough talent for ten years, knows that she has what it takes to succeed in the theater no matter how discouraged producer Van Heflin of his hometown. <br /><br /> I really liked Judy in this, since the girl was determined to do it in the theater. Because it is Judy Garland, with the talent of Judy Garland, you, in the audience, know that you have the right things, even if Van Heflin likes almost the whole movie to convince himself. <br /><br /> Both Judy and Heflin are from the same small town, Heflin&#39;s father was the city doctor who gave them to her and Heflin, while he could have moved and become a big producer on Broadway, their respective mothers, Fay. Bainter and Spring Byington have kept in touch. That&#39;s his entrance, but Heflin is constantly stuck with stagnant children, but never anyone like Lily Mars. <br /><br /> Presenting Lily Mars for Garland had no real success, even though he sings all of his numbers. The best of the film is a resurgence of the chestnut of the gas light era, Each small movement has a meaning of its own. Judy sings it with Connie Gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a Broadway theater where the Heflin show takes place. Gilchrist was a star in the days of FloraDora Girls and she and Judy deliver the song in great style with Connie. It&#39;s the best scene in the movie, as Gilchrist encourages Judy to continue. The composer Karl Hoschna had died a long time ago, but the lyricist Otto Harbach was still alive and I bet he liked what he heard. <br /><br /> The European musical star Marta Eggerth is in Presenting Lily Mars as the star of the show that at first is bewildered, then angry and, finally, in understanding Garland and Heflin. He made a couple of films with MGM and then returned to Europe to work more on the continent. I bet MGM did not know what to do with her and her Hungarian accent, although Louis B. Mayer never met a soprano she did not like. <br /><br /> Van Heflin performs well as the patient producer who supports many things of Garland and Eggerth. Heflin had just come out of his Oscar for Johnny Eager the year before and he and Garland do not seem to be an ideal screen team, but they are not bad together. <br /><br /> The presentation of Lily Mars is an excellent showcase for the talents of Judy Garland. And he did not have to share the screen in another movie behind the scenes with Mickey Rooney.']
