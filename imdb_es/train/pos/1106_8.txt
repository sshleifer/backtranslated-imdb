If you are a fan of the great Altman actors, as shown by the great films like M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and the less viewed films like A Wedding, then you will undoubtedly be entertained with HealtH. Centered around a health convention where two women run for president, HealtH contains many of Altman's 70s like Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, as well as including Newcomer stars of Altman such as Lauren Bacall James Garner, and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman ensemble films, there are numerous subplots in this film, but it is not as overwhelming as movies like Nashville or A Wedding, but it has a more focused feel, perhaps like M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. Everything is an obvious satire in the Health movement, full of exaggerated, extravagant and contradictory characters, with guest stars like Dick Cavett offering ironic comments on the whole thing. The underlining of the entire electoral process is Altman's characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal, but the most attractive feature of this film is the fun that most people seem to be having. This would be one of the last Altman movies like this for a while!
