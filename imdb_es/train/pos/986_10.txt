If you like Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), "Date From Hell", '01, you'll love his performance as a guy who never gets a quiet life and ends up playing with shrimp, (jumbo size) and at the same time a lot of gold ingots. Alvin Sanders has a lot of eyes of the FBI that observe him and end up being hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse, (Edgar Clenteen), "Hack" '02 TV Series, decides to focus on poor Alvin and use him as a The Fish Hook called to attract criminals. There are many laughs, dramas, cold-blooded murders and excellent places to shoot movies and many expensive cars that are sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was a great entertainment throughout the film.
