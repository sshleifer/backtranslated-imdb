I heard that Madonna was briefly considered for the role of Catherine Tremell. Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH. She is not even close. <br /> <br /> BAD INCARNATE: Sharon Stone is a bit long on the tooth, despite the beneficial effects of modern chemistry and surgery. However, she treats us artistically to a terrifying personification of evil beyond redemption. In the obligatory sex scene, she projects pure and crystalline lust. Especially his hooded eyes, luminous and a flat face of pleasure. Thanks to the brilliant use of lighting and other scenic techniques, the harsh lines of age only occasionally manifest themselves. Rather, it seems to have a slight golden glow (YES, YEARS). <br /> <br /> The locations gave us a view of London which is a pleasant departure from the typical London landscapes. The character of Catherine is so powerful and threatening that I thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed. I would not have had the opportunity. <br /> <br /> THE ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINCT; ATTEMPTS IN CENSORSHIP: I must briefly comment on the original movie of 1992, set in San Francisco, a beautiful city worthy of this film. It's outstanding, from music to locations and sets, and so on. Paul Verhoven took surprising performances from the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> That the main Baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of gay and lesbian activists in the Bay Area. Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied. PUFF UP. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, insisting on rewriting that they would promote their political and psychiatric agendas. Example: By sadistically claiming sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the main role be changed from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY. <br /> <br /> In the San Francisco places, the gentle and tolerant activists did everything possible to sabotage the shooting of the scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. The executive producers, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, promised to fight against any effort to restrict the guaranteed artistic freedom in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against disruptive tactics. <br /> <br /> BLOWBACK: Thanks to the fulminating activists, the film got a lot of coverage from the national press: millions of dollars in free advertising. His calls for spectators to boycott the film led to a backlash that caused customers to wait in long lines where the film was released. He also received high praise from critics. It was, in the words of the reptile Hackett on RED, "A GREAT TIT TITT!" I'm sorry, gentle reader; I just could not resist that. Yes, he is a gibe. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that BASIC INSTINCT 1 and 2, with their brilliant musical scores, aesthetics and acting, are works of art <br /> <br /> that merit protection under our Constitution .
