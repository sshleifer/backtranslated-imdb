Did you ever want to know how much Hollywood could escape before the Hayes Code was officially enforced? Well, unfortunately, "Convention City" has been lost, so you just have to look at "Tarzan and his partner" to find out. By 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. Just look at Jane's naked bathroom. While Tarzan is often considered an adventure movie made for young children and no one else, this image shows that the series was originally very adult. More than seventy years later, it's still as sexy as it was when it came out. <br /> <br /> In addition to the envelope that pushes taboo nature, it is an excellent and exciting adventure story. I have always liked the jungle movies that Hollywood produced in the 30s and 40s, but there are some of the genre that I would call great movies. "Tarzan and his partner" is by far the best film of this sub-genre that has disappeared. The sequences of safari attacks by monkeys or natives still manage to create tension today. Also, the animals are too cold (especially the monkeys that throw rocks). The performance will not win any important prizes soon, but it is certainly more than adequate for this type of image. The film is stolen once more by Cheetah, the most intelligent monkey in the jungle. One of the most entertaining examples of precodigo in Hollywood.
