Curly Sue is a 6 year old girl with a lot of hair and a life adrift. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the streets while being small scammers. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in an expensive parking lot, while Curly will shout about the demands and traction to the victim. It turns out that she is a very exclusive lawyer called Gray (Kelly Lynch) who is horrified by what she has done. Not only do the scammers make some money, they also spend the night in Gray's luxurious apartment. Even then, Gray feels he owes them more so the three come together for a spell. Gray only knows the lucrative business of the law and nothing of life. Who better to teach it than Bill and Curly, those expert experts in the realities of life? But, all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of scammers. Or there is there This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple, but much sharper, of course. Belushi gives a rare and moving performance, since his bad luck is side by side and Lynch is luminous as the presumptuous but gentle lawyer. John Hughes, as writer and director, shows us his magic touch once again, since the script is alive and unpredictable. Just watch Curly and Bill take Gray out for one night, without money, and see the comic results. Do you long for a happy ending, promised for a long time and finally fulfilled, with some uncertain moments in between? This is your made-to-measure movie.
