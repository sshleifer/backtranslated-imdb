In general, I like something light and fun, so this movie should not have been attractive to me. But he caught me from the beginning. The history of elections and the challenges of a family seems obvious, but it raises the question again and again: "What if it were my family? My choice?" I cried and I laughed when they did it because I really felt what the people involved felt. He was in difficult places to see, but harder to refuse. The story is true, and life is sometimes hard to see! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story in its own right. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true. As in real life, you really do not know what will happen next, or why people do the things they do.
