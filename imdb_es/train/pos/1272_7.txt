Nice movie although I think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth. It's a mystery in the middle of the movie to know why Elly is such a recluse. Then, when we finally receive an explanation about his childhood, there are still not many details. Maybe if they had shown flashbacks or something like that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's still a good movie that I would see again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
