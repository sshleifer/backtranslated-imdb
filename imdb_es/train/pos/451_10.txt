If someone asks why nobody makes movies like before, with a conversation, a character and a simple theme of friendship that struggles to evolve towards something new, better and different, these people need to participate in this film and see how it is written and directed . , and a performance that merges into a wonderful evening of observation about how things used to be in Italy and England. Other days, other times they became an excellent entertainment comedy, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the lead roles. Under the brushstroke of Mike Newell, these actors vividly perform memorable performances that are photographed with the eye of a sublimely subtle painter. Reminiscent of the theater farce of the bedroom of the turn of the century, this film could be called a farce of friendship that becomes a valuable experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too. An artistic telegram about the importance of taking care of those around us.
