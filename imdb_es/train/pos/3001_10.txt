Breaking good thread with all the actors giving great value. Michael Curtiz at his best. Many nice twists and turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his best. A precursor to the Thin Man series. I recommend it to everyone. Did you solve everything?
