This movie is replete with horror movie articles: chain-chained madmen, premeditated murders, a mad scientist (vaguely lesbian) with an even crazier father wearing a mask due to his horrible disfigurement, poisoning, creepy castles, werewolves and women ), adultery, lovers of murders, Tibetan mystics, victim half man / half plant of an anonymous experiment, robbery of tombs, mental control, walled bodies, car accident on a lonely road, electrocution, knights in armor - The lot, all topped with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst works of Foley ever made. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (even by the standards of badly nicknamed Spanish horror films) and some of the editions are just weird. In a scene in which the main evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her room with one of the misqualified people: "That's fantastic, I do not understand, explain again how is this ..." Exhibition scenes that mess up This In the movie, a cut hand appears from the girl's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason other than covering a cut in the "Mwahaha of the bad scientist! All your werewolves belong to mine! " speaks. Although I do not know why they bothered to do that, because there are many other abrupt cuts everywhere, even taking into account the atrocious sweeping and scanning of the print that I saw. <br /> <br /> The Director Was, according to an interview with the star, drunk for most of the shooting and the movie looks like that. It is an incoherent mess. It was made even more incoherent by the inclusion of images of a werewolf rampage from a different movie, The Mark of the Wolf Man (made 4 years earlier, with the same actor but playing the role more aggressively and with a different shirt and makeup a word in Spanish for "Continuidad"?) and more quilted by another actor in the group of wolfman wandering in the long shot. <br /> <br /> The music is incredibly bad, varying almost randomly from the house full of creepy music orchestra, to bosannova, to the longest recorded piano and gong duo. (On second thought, it might not have been a duo - it could have been a solo.) The piano part was so simple it could have been chosen with one hand while the player hit the gong with the other.) <Br /> <br /> This is one of the most disconcerting films induced by the trance state of the year so far for me. Enjoy <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona, ​​this madness and perversity will turn against you!" How true. <br /> <br /> Favorite shot: the lover, upon discovering that his girlfriend was killed, dropped the candle in a surprise demonstration with cartoons. Amateur rank leading there.
