I can not remember many details about the program, but I remember how passionate I was with him and how I was determined not to miss any episode. Unfortunately, at the time we did not have a VCR, so I never saw the series again. However, I can remember how I felt as I watched it and how excited I was each time it went on. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think he was almost in love) and is still one of my favorite actors today, mainly due to his appearance in the series. I would be happy to buy / steal / download this series, I think I would try my best to see it again and revisit a past childhood ... Any ideas? Does anyone know of a site dedicated to the series or have the episodes recorded since its first broadcast?
