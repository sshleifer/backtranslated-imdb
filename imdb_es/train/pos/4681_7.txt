In general, I enjoyed this film and I would recommend it to lovers of independent cinema. <br /> <br /> However, I really want to point out the similarities between parts of this film and Nichols' Closer. A scene, especially in which the character of Adrian Grenier questions Rosario Dawson about his sex life while he was absent, is very similar to the scene in Closer where the character of Clive Owen questions Julia Roberts, although he acts less harshly. intensity in "Love". Also keep in mind that "Anna" is the name of the character of Dawson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Now Closer is based on the work of Patrick Marber and, supposedly, this film is loosely based on the "Reigen" by Arthur Schnitzler, so I'm not sure how this connection was formed. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have an idea?
