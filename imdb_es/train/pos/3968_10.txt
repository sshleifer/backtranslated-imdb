The first time I saw this movie was as a child and I recently bought it on a DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty, a dedicated and dedicated agent of the FBI. His life in the Office is interspersed with his family life, which is not entirely happy. His wife (an excellent portrait of Vera Miles) lives fearing the dangerous nature of his work, and even separates for a while; Chip's best friend and fellow agent Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) dies in a shootout; Chip's son, Mike, enlists in the Marine Corps during World War II. Throughout all this, the family continues with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are quite exciting and the semi documentary style of the film works effectively. And the music of Max Steiner says it all; fidelity, courage and integrity. <br /> <br /> This country has a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and, yes, to J. Edgar Hoover as well. If Mr. Hoover's surveillance had been observed, we could have saved ourselves on September 11, the wave of crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we have had to endure since his death.
