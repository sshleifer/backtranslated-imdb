I thought "The Grinch Stole Christmas" was a pretty good movie. It was not horrible, nor was it great, but it was nice to see it. It felt like Jim Carrey sometimes got a little upset. They made the Grinch look like a special education person, when everything that had to be was bad and torturous, but nonetheless it turned out to be a bit delayed. I thought the landscape, when it was not inside the Grinch cave, was beautiful, and there were some parts that I laughed at, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This movie could have been "SO MUCH" much better if they had changed the Grinch's personality, and would have included some more scenes of laughter, because most of the humor was not funny. Anyway, I liked How The Grinch Stole Christmas, but I did not It's nothing to get excited about seeing.
