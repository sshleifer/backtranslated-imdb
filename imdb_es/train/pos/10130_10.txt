The pilot is very well done. It establishes how the characters come together in future episodes. I do not think anyone could have created a better driver for this show. It shows a remarkable creativity on the part of the writers. Although not everything was fixed because it was the first episode, many events that happen in future seasons were shown in the pilot. An example would be the future relationship of Ross and Rachels. Although the nervousness of a first episode appeared, it was surpassed by an amazing plot and an excellent choice of the cast. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start for an unbeatable comedy!
