Airwolf The Movie, a variation of the original 2-part pilot, however, the film, although shorter, contains extra footage. You do not see in the 2 hour pilot. The pilot is much more pilot than the movie. Where a pilot movie is usually the same (2 parts combined) But the movie is actually a different edition with extras here and cuts there. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out, even if you have the season 1 DVD set, I would still take a copy of the "movie" It's still in some stores like Virgin, Woolworths and mixed media stores , although you usually need orders, but you save the need to shop online (as many of us still do not trust online shopping) but if you look around airwolfs in stores <br /> <br /> Airwolf was really one of the shows with the lowest ratings of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Currently, a full-sized Airwolf is being rebuilt for a Helicopter Museum:) The information images and work in progress can be found at http: // Airwolf .org Also with Airwolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games. re to stay :)
