"Panic" is a captivating and blurry film about a conciliation of the infamy of middle-aged and conflicting hitman conflict between a younger uninhibited hairdresser, his love for wife and son, his duty towards his employer / father with his identity. Although the film has a nebulous purpose and an ambiguous ending, it is an excellent production in almost all aspects. The clarity and sincerity of the characters in such an unlikely story can fascinate and annoy the public.
