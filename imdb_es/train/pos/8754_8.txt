I saw this movie 11 years ago in the company of my best friend. They pulled my teeth out of the trial, so I did not feel very well. <br /> <br /> I ended up liking myself in a big way. It is difficult to observe if one considers that it deals with friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug trafficking and the extremely difficult situation that has to do with living in a foreign prison. <br /> <br /> The performance is at its first level. Two of the women that most wish for stars are, and that's a good thing. Claire Danes is as cute and charming as ever, while Kate Beckinsale is extremely sexy and offers excellent performance. Bill Pullman is also great and shows his histrionic qualities. <br /> <br /> There are many twists in the plot to dig and make it an interesting visual experience. In addition, it shows the difficult times in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is an underestimated movie. Not many movies like this have emerged in recent history. It should make you think about many things ...
