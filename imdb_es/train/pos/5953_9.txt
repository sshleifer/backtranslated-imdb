I understand that Paramount wanted to film this with the score of Rodgers and Hart, but could not solve the copyright issues, so Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote among them, most of the songs for Bing Crosby contributed a good punctuation. <Br /> <br /> I read Leonard Maltin saying that this film, "fits Crosby like a glove" and could not have put it better. No, it's not the satire of Mark Twain, it's a Bing Crosby movie and in 1949 Crosby was the most profitable star in Hollywood. For once, Paramount used Technicolor and Rhonda Fleming was never more charming on the screen. This was a woman for whom Technicolor was invented. <br /> <br /> The origins of Brooklyn by William Bendix stand out a bit, but it is a good comic effect. The trio of Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have had a great time with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his optimistic philosophical numbers patented with If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon. <br /> <br /> The third song that sings Once and For Always, alone and with Rhonda Fleming. That song was nominated for the best song, but lost with Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> It is also good that Bing has managed to record the Decca score with Rhonda Fleming, Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that it shows the comedic talents of Crosby without Bob Hope. I like Road photos, but Bing was a comedic talent about himself and this movie is better than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of his game.
