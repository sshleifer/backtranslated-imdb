I'm a big fan of Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all, and this is one of the best! It's fun, romantic, and a classic. I recommend it for all ages. It's great for young children because it's fine, Cinderella and great for adults and teenagers because it's fun and not overdone. I saw it when I was little and I still see it now. It has great lines that my family and I quote all the time. The acting is great and never gets old. If you like fairy tales and romances, you will love it. I have seen many Cinderella movies in my time and this is the best one of all. (Sorry, Disney) I recommend this movie and all the Faerie Tale Theater shows. All of them are attractive for all ages and are unique and very entertaining.
