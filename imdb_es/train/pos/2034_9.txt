['I&#39;ve never been this great in IMAX movies. They&#39;re great, but once you get over that initial rush of &quot;Whoa, it feels like flying!&quot; The films themselves are generally quite corny and ordinary. <br /><br /> The exceptions have been the powerful &quot;Everest&quot;, the exciting &quot;Wild California&quot; and now the &quot;Human Body&quot; of the BBC, a large look inside our bodies. <br /><br /> Our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable. This 50-minute movie could last 10 hours, and even then it would not reach all the systems that work in tandem at the same time that I write this review and listen to my radio, and most of us take everything for granted. <br /><br /> Here you can see the inside of a heart that pumps (it looks like an alien spaceship), the inside of your lungs, the small hairs on your eardrum that process the sound, the development of a baby inside a mother&#39;s womb and, surprisingly, some of them. The ... um, less attractive functions than I thought it would go away (pimples, agitation of acids in the stomach ...) <br /><br /> This film also has a quite original style, which distinguishes it from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we&#39;ve all seen sperm find their way to the egg, but have you ever seen it to the rhythm of Marvin Gaye&#39;s &quot;Let&#39;s Get It On?&quot; They are creative moments like that that make &quot;The human body&quot; not only a health lesson, but also a fun one.']
