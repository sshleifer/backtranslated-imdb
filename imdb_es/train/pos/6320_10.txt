The main reason I wanted to see this movie was the wonderful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in a movie is something incredible without really seeing it. But this movie took me by surprise. It was not what I expected. It's been a while since I saw it, but I do remember that I could not stop laughing! And it was not just the cast that did it for me. The script was written amazingly. Every time you expected something to happen, it did not happen. There were so many twists and turns, but it fit the full tone of the movie instead of looking pretentious. The cinematography, together with the set, was absolutely beautiful as well. I really can not say anything bad about this movie! Except, I would have Andrew Davoli a little more time on screen!
