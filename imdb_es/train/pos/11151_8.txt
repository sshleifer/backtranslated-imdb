The only reason I knew about Midnight Cowboy was because I was in the Top 100 of AFI Critic. For a top 100 it's not a well-known movie; In fact, I had to search a lot to find a copy, I got the DVD version at half price. Surprisingly, it was only rated M15 + (the uncut version). <br /> <br /> I doubt that many will take note of this revision (more as a comment), so I will brief it. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I've seen, partly due to the use of montages, artistic filming (very art-house) and the unusual theme. There are many things in the movie that I still do not understand (I've seen it twice), and it's an emotionally confusing movie. <br /> <br /> The filming and the acting were very good, and it is The characters bigger than life make this film memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a "cowboy" from Texas who moves to New York to become a prostitute. Meet the crippled swindler Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and, of course, become friends who go through the usual adventures. What makes the movie interesting is that the two characters are very different. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film did not really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo so that the audience has a real emotional connection, although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens when you read the reviews, but it's pretty obvious from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the film explores its main themes in a beautiful and moving way. The deprivation of humanity (shown by the darkness of the streets of the city, the houses in decomposition). Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law (a scammer, giggolo.etc) but you can not help but like them. Joe Buck is attractive because he is so naive and optimistic, while we started feeling sorry for Ratso later in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was rated so high because it was certainly very innovative for its period. At that time (and even now) it definitely was not a typical movie (pretty much art-house). At a time when cinema was dominated by westerns, musicals and tired dramas, a film with a theme as unusual as Midnight Cowboy appears. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I must say that I really liked the movie. The images transmit a dream quality. I especially liked the scene in the party, the music, the images, etc. They remain in your mind for a long time after seeing them. However, as a movie for entertainment was a bit lacking (it's not really my movie style) in emotions. This is a movie to savor and appreciate, instead of a cheap and exciting action movie. <br /> <br /> Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyze this film, the characters and their motives were very interesting. From what I understand of flashbacks, Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother, although it still does not seem relevant to the story. He is a carefree young stallion, who represses his darkest memories. The religious connotations in the film are also disconcerting. Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso, although I do not see where they got the idea from. The issue of homosexuality in general is more than addressed in their conversation, and later in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man, but it has little to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Certainly from a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (it has more of a feeling of the 70s than a feeling of the 60s) and revolutionary for its time to touch issues that few other films dared to do. While it has a simple and sentimental story (disguised by a hard edge), the beauty of the film is found in strange sequences, often psychedelic.
