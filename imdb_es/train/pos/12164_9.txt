In a year of pretentious joke like "Synecdoche, New York", a film born of the own complacency of Charlie Kaufman, comes a film that is equally difficult to see but almost three times more important. "Frownland" is a work of love on the part of the team, the actors and the filmmaker, filmed for years by friends. Trace a man who can not communicate through his REAL world of Brooklyn completely authentic. The people you see are one step beyond even the stylization of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses, unwilling to change, incapable. For them, the real world is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so deeply out of touch, it's very hard to see. It is a 16mm film without adequate light, money or any of the other factors that would make a film "polished", but its honesty can not be underestimated, a fact that would cause a room full of people fired and for Richard Linklater to give him a prize as he did at SXSW. This is reminiscent of films like "Naked" or the best of "mumblecore". It is a film that is not for everyone, but that challenges you to see it and makes you grow the more you think about it.
