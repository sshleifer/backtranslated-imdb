"Painting is seeing, then remembering better than what you saw." This is what Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter of The Light That Failed, says. The film is Hollywood-style, starring Ronald Colman and a support cast that includes Ida Lupino in his first major role, reliable character actor Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned.), And a solid performance of the wonderful actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The title and initial sequences of the film reveal the fact that Dick will lose his sight. He is blinded by the gunpowder discharge while he and his childhood girlfriend Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with a gun. Esa. Later, a wound while fighting in Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already blinded by ambition, and he really does not reach his full potential to the point where his sight is leaving him. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and her self-destruction starts. Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays very well with Colman. His evil pie reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Well performed and well directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.
