There are other comments here, so I do not need to say how good it is or what it is about ... My point is: I heard about this movie a long time ago, before it showed up. I can not even remember HOW, I only know that it was through the Internet. The dealers sank before it hit! For months I got on my bike and complained. Note that on this page there is a link to buy this movie and that the only highlighted area is VHS on Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Alta Vista's Babelfish to translate. I know it's the PAL format and they changed the text of the screen to German and at the beginning there is a small part of the narrative that has also been dubbed in German, but as funny and cheesy as this movie, it really just makes it more fun! If you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that makes conversions, it's worth it! It cost around twenty dollars to get to the US UU From Germany. Trust me, it may seem like a lot to spend on a movie, but if you like cheating, you'll be losing money from left to right and getting conversions for your friends!
