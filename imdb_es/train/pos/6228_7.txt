Another fun, witty and sparkling musical by RKO with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a lovely movie. While it lacks the great featured melodies of SWNG TIME (although the final number "Facing music and dance" is one of the best on the team and rightly so), it is very funny, since these two could do almost nothing wrong together. the thirties. Once again, the plot is light and easy to forget, but seeing Fred and Ginger dancing together is a true paradise. These two transmitted more romance and magic in dance than many couples in movies in a great love scene. While there are better musicals by Fred and Ginger, this is definitely a must see.
