"Cinderella" is a film about a girl whose mother died and her father remarried. Once her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and forced her to do all the chores of the house, like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters. One day, the king sent a message to all single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella could not leave, but her sisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball, until her fairy godmother appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella a beautiful woman, but she had to come back at midnight because that's when the magic changes again. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses the notion of time and the clock marks midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her crystal slipper. Then the king orders the duke to look for the women who were wearing that sneaker. The duke searched all the houses, but finally found the women he belonged to, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated films of Disney in 1950. This film is about a magical fairy tale. At the beginning of the film, Cinderella was a servant of her own family and had no one to love her, but with a little magic, her whole life changed and she finally found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about "Cinderella" is music. When the fairy godmother of Cinderella appeared performing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing at my house, so I'll never forget it. I also loved the part where Cinderella and the Prince sang the song So This is Love as they danced because they realized they were in love. In general, this movie was my favorite movie when I was a little girl because every little girl wants to live a fairytale life.
