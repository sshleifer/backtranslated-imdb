This movie is tremendous to encourage the spirits. <br /> <br /> Every time I see her, I see and hear funny things that I missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones (Foreigner) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) wrote the songs, making Strange Fruit the best thing that has ever hit the music scene today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a strictly fictional game from the 60s to the 70s. A band that was never good to start, due to the use of drugs and internal fighting. One wonders what it could have been, while listening to his fanatical soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The Fruit was inspired by The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> Each Fruit Member are quite memorable. Stephen Rea plays Tony Costello, whom the promoter of the festival asks him to gather his band for a reunion tour, hoping to obtain monetary benefits. Costello has approached the ex roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him rekindle the flame of a past dream. <br /> <br /> Juliet meets the bitter Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes), making a mistake against Timothy Spall (David 'Beano' Baggot), and the extravagantly glamorous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Tumbling is another ex-roadie, the hippy-toker-jokester Hughie (Billy Connolly), who never let the flame burn out. <br /> <br /> While Juliet searches for the last member of her motley band, the elusive guitarist and songwriter Brian Lovell (played by meddling Bruce Robinson), the assembled members fight, as in the old days, fighting for the rusty talent of others. <br /> <br /> The band has the opportunity to do a small Dutch tour, to prepare the festival. With the young man as Hendrix, Luke Shand (Hans Matheson) taking the place of Lovell, the crew hits the road. Sparks fly as your memories advance, threatening to burn your unfinished goals ... <br /> <br /> Prepare to laugh, sing, clap and cry, while these memorable characters are engraved in your hearts. .
