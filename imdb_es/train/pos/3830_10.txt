The first time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie, we were seeing it for Alex Winter of the fame of "Bill & Ted's". We did not know what to expect other than who and what it was about. <br /> <br /> When the movie ended, we knew it was love at first sight. This film, while not completely accurate from the historical point of view, was and is the best of its kind. I have seen other films that show the history of this famous summer and, in my opinion, none of the others can compare. He fused a little with certain details, but those parts did not take away the elegance and romance of the story. I've seen the other films about this summer and I think most of them are good, but none so captivating. <br /> <br /> "Haunted Summer" has the qualities of a painting. The colors and the configuration seem to be something that one could find on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric house. The costumes were beautiful and, despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world, I wanted to find a seamstress to create such clothing for me. The whole film was developed in the picturesque lake of Geneva (where I hope to go someday to see this movie) and the serenity that these historical figures found there. <br /> <br /> This film shows, in addition to the tranquility found. for all the fugitives of the harsh judgments of England, the strangeness that also surrounded this adventure. Yes, there were drugs. It was a fairly common practice during that time, a time when drugs were not illegal. And the taking of laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was both medicinal and recreational. Shelley suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered the pains of a bruised foot. It was not surprising that there were prescriptions for the strong drugs that were in his possession during that summer. And they were poets during a time when experience was the key. There was no time for prudent caution. Passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era. And from the thoughts and discussions about science, religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend: "Frankenstein". <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (not married to Shelley at that time) played by the beautiful and talented Alice Krige. She is the controlling factor of everything that happens until she also gives in to the experience. But she stands firm and experiences things on her own terms. How was the fortress he inherited from his mother and father. <br /> <br /> The actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played. The right music. The management captured the essence of summer, as I read about it. This film was based on a wonderful book "Haunted Summer" by Anne Edwards. If you like this movie, read the book. The author takes the story of what she could gather from the actual diaries of Mary Godwin Shelley and the other participants in this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (even small inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and gothic, then this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of the monster's birth, which even today teaches us about the morality of "playing God". <br /> <br /> A movie that should be seen!
