Really the story of two arrogant brothers and their respective falls in disgrace (through drug addiction) and then redemption. A brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco is your typical and intelligent man-child. The other brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less critical when he himself is a victim of addiction when dealing with the stress of living up to his family's expectations for both children. It is not as clumsy as the drug-related fables want to be, and in general it is a fairly realistic sketch of the family dynamics generated by drug-related problems. I would recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and I congratulate James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a work of love.
