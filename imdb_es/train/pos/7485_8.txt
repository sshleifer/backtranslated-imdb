I had heard some not-so-good things about this movie and I had probably seen the low score here on IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today Vanilla Sky showed on television and how I had nothing better to do ... and it turned out that it would have been hard to find something better to do. Vanilla Sky is a terrifying, sad and moving movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a long time. I was surprised how it affected me seeing it. It is difficult to explain, but during the film, your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is happening change and it is a quite emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really moved me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any means of communication for that matter. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.
