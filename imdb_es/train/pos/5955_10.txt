['As creator of &quot;This Darkness&quot;, I admit that we neglected 3 very important recognitions in our final credits. The omissions were visions that could not be corrected once they were committed, nor did the parties involved, who saw the film, mention it at that time. On behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film, I extend an apology. Obviously, some of the criticism posted here is harsh in light of the fact that your credit is accidental. Our production values were insignificant and our &quot;special effects&quot; were quite special, but the plot is very strong and John McLeod&#39;s photography is excellent. We hope that you, the reader, will enjoy &quot;This Darkness&quot; and the efforts of those who worked their butts for free. Thank you, Dylan O&#39;Leary, Director.']
