Pop quiz: you are part of the modern armed forces in times of peace in routine maneuvers and you find yourself back in time with the opportunity to change the story. What do you do? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, you change the Japanese G.Is in G.I. Samurai (also known as Timeslip) to the crew of an American aircraft carrier, ask them to discuss how to stop the attack in Pearl Harbor for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no one reminds them that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with This movie by Sonny Chiba. But unlike its Hollywood counterpart, The Final Countdown, this is based on one premise: backing 400 years in the Japanese feudal wars, its soldiers in peacetime decide that their best hope of returning is to provoke history by trying to change it by joining a warlord. To conquer the country? It indicates the action of the tank and the helicopter against the samurai, including a relentless 25-minute battle sequence with a cast of thousands of people inflicting serious damage to each other. And yes, there are beheadings. <br /> <br /> Of course, things do not go according to plan, and even a superior firepower does not stand up as well as thousands of soldiers are expected. Even before that, the soldiers are fighting between those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and plunder through hell. Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought out, soft rock, country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they present English lyrics sung by Japanese singers who audibly can not pronounce the words let alone speak the language, but it is a flaw forgivable. in a surprisingly good science fiction action game. <br /> <br /> The UK DVD of Optimum is a good transfer of the 138 minute uncut version.
