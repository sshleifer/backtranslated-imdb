This was one of the highlights of the second semi-forgettable season of ST: TNG, before they "grew" or grew in the third season and beyond. This was not only a showcase for the promising ones like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but it was also the continuation of Data's search for his "humanity", this time through the concept of comedy. I'm still one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> On a side note, I am still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character Okona was about to have an appointment (after the character of Teri Hatcher) before being rudely interrupted by the Lieutenant Worf. I remember seeing this episode as "first race" in my friends' comics store in the past and we all thought that she would have been a perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beautiful lady really is ...
