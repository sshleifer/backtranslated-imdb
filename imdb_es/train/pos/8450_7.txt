It was not really bad for the first PPV of 006 of Raw. But the end was really shocking for all the attendees and for those who were watching at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH- RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It is not a bad starter, these two can play a big game seriously if they had more time to play a wrestling match. Flair wins over DQ after Edge hits him with his MITB suitcase. 3/10 SECOND GAME - TRISH STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP It's not bad to notice the fact that this is the first time these Divas met together in the ring. Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick, but Trish dodges and sticks her own Chick Kick to gain the victory and retain her title. 3/10 THIRD PARTY- TRIPLE H VS. BIG SAMPLE Seriously, this match was, really. The whole game, HHH, focuses on the injured arm of Big Show, but Big Show still responds. Later, HHH is able to knock down Big Show and nail a Pedigree for victory. 5/10 FOURTH MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was an extra game} It's not that bad, it was good. After Viscera was down, behind the referee, Benjamin's mom received a bag (which had bricks in it) and hit Viscera in the head with him three times. Viscera stood up only to be caught with a rotating kick of the heel by Benjamin for the victory against the great man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH - JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Bored, slow and sloppy. Both men really did not put in a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for victory. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH PARTY- TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. Maria vs CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST COUPLE OF WOMEN IN EL GAUNTLE It was very entertaining for me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice for the last time to win the first female Gauntlet game. 5/10 SEPTIMO PARTIDO- JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI AT A CHAMBER OF ELIMINATION MATCH FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a great match in the elimination chamber. But nothing will surpass the Elimination Chamber last year, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Cena and Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters and gets a roll to eliminate him. Seconds later, Cena gets a summary of Carlito for the count of the three to win the Elimination Chamber and retain his WWE title. But his night was not over yet. 7/10 After the game, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Cena for his victory. Vince McMahon says his night is not over yet, and says that Edge charges his "Money In The Bank" opportunity to challenge Cena for the title. Edge goes out with Lita, gives Vince the briefcase and goes to the ring when Cena has one more match to go tonight. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH: JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP (Dinner, which is shattered during the House game) is immediately hit by Edge, Edge then sticks a spear into Cena, goes down the cover and to his surprise, Cena breaks. Edge knocks down another Spear and covers the shocking three count, as he defeated Cena and won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Year's Revolution was better than this year's, but it was still good. The EC game was also good and Edge's surprising coup on his MITB opportunity is definitely the most shocking on the PPV show. <br /> <br /> In general: I will give you 7/10 and a C
