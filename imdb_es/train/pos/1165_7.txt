As another IMDB critic commented, this movie starts a little slow, but it improves considerably as it goes on. Yes, it was published by Roger Corman, and yes, it reviews some of the same thematic motifs of the predecessors of much higher budgets, such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the juxtaposition of the wife's career as a growing blues singer against the loneliness that the husband accumulates and his almost Freudian need to fill the emotional and physical "void" or "hole" while she is absent along with The intelligent use of minimal effects and adjustments is well done. Using a very small number of places and characters, and also using water in almost all scenes as a metaphoric symbol of cleanliness and drowning, this film, although clearly has a minuscule budget, reminds me in many ways to the most complete and most recent scenario , namely, the French film "SWIMMING POOL", which I think can at least have borrowed some useful ideas from "UP AGAINST AMANDA". With a smaller set of tools, UP AGAINST AMANDA maintains its suspense with a rudimentary and fatalistic vision of surrendering to the occasional temptations of lust, but achieves it as well as other films of this genre. The stepfather's turn from Amanda's abuse in the past (again, very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction to the difficult situation of Amanda that this aspect of the story provokes. The cast is excellent, I think. <br /> <br />
