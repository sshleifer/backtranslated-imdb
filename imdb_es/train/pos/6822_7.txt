"Opening Night" released in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. It only succeeds in the really impressive performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character of the stage actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. She is self-absorbed, often unpleasant, and makes life miserable for those around her, in other words, not like some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman who is on the verge of collapse; We are not sure if the demons he is fighting with are real or imagined, even though we are told the secret before. Rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her talented husband, actor and director John Cassavettes, who also has a role in the film. This film is not without its flaws: it's too long, and the last part of the movie where Myrtle takes the stage while she's very drunk seems almost cruel. The "improvisation" in some of the dialogues, at least while on stage, continues too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially Ben Gazarra, playing the producer of poor quality Myrtle. The character of Joan Blondell is never fully developed, and I could never understand why she was in the movie, except to placate Myrtle. Watch this movie just for Rowlands (it's fascinating in everything) and it's hard to take your eyes off it, although sometimes you'll want to.
