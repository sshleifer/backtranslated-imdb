I started watching the program from the first season, and at first I was quite skeptical about it. The original movie was somewhat childish, and I was looking for a science fiction program while I waited for the new BSG season. <br /> <br /> But after some episodes, I became a fan. I loved the characters, the not so stupid as you think Jack O'Neill is, the not only smart Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal'c, the favorite of women and children, and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Of course, the stories are sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but mostly it's not about technology or space struggle, it's about helping your friend, even risking your life for him. It's about "we do not leave anyone behind". Fighting until the end when all hope is lost. On the free will, and all the good qualities that make a human - Human. <br /> <br /> And now he's breaking a record, going to the 10th season, and he's still doing well.
