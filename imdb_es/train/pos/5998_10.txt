The Cure is an incredible movie ... So exciting and so REAL! I was lucky to see a screening of 'The Cure' at its premiere in New York and it left me completely impressed! I also heard that he won a prize for that particular festival, and he definitely deserved it. The first thing that caught my attention was cinematography. Eric Giovon did an incredible job. The filming style of the love scene halfway through the movie was incredible. A love scene was necessary in this film, and Jafri understood, but he also maintained the scene with good taste. Giovon and Jafri are an excellent creative team and should work together on future projects. Judy Maier's narrative was so surreal but at the same time heartbreaking, it made me feel what the main character felt. I am a very hard critic, but I must say that The Cure is one of my favorite movies. If you have not seen it yet, take a look!
