Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he makes up for it with his portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge above and above life. <br /> <br /> Particularly effective is when you face Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the movie. When Scott stands before a large window, sunlight casts a bright mantle over him; All you can see is its silhouette. Increased by Scott's voice, a heavy growl, the effect is galvanizing ... very much like the first scene of Marlon Brando in APOCALYPSE NOW. "The horror", by the way! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, the same thing that works for you can also act against you. Because Scott shows such cheerful joy throughout the film, it is contagious. In other words, the "before" of Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the "after", although in reality it should not be. This is what we might call the "Doctor Smith" effect, since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when interpreting that role and many other heavy ones (scenarios and screens alike). <br /> <br /> Actually, not myself. Consider Scott's anger is a responsibility. But other purists of "Christmas Story" could. Watch the movie and judge for yourselves.
