Before watching, make sure you've seen The Night of the Living Dead ... This could be the best 7 minute parody I've seen! Absurd, shit 'special effects' (the rope, the rope!), And slices of man's bread ... What else do you need? (<br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie while you eat bread ... you might be scared!)
