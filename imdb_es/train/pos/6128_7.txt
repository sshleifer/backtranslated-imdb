Yes, this is a horror of degree B. But at least the producers, directors and cast do not pretend that this movie is the manna of heaven. The plot is corny, a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is sprinkled with genetic acid turning him into a snowman. The snowman a.k.a. Jack Frost then goes on a murder attack to find the town's little sheriff who finally arrested him. With a limited budget, the crew had to cope with limited special effects, most of the money seems to be spent in the snowman costume. The particular difficult shots are handled with cartoons or panoramic shots (shots where the camera moves away to hide the details). <br /> <br /> This is not a children's movie and should not be confused with the Disney movie of the same title. If you do not allow your children to watch the movies on page 13 alone, parents should not allow their children to watch this movie. This movie has two claims of fame. 1. The beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) made her first major role in a movie. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth is worth seeing several times. 2. This movie has the worst snowman joke. The joke is so bad that the directors credit the joke teller on the credit list.
