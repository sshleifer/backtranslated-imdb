Soylent Green IS ... a really good movie, actually. <br /> <br /> I never would have thought about it. I really do not like Heston in his science fiction efforts. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, manages to face everyone with contempt and invincibility most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And, in fact, he also makes fun of a lot of Soylent Green, but since he's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully, I do not care. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people go crazy. up in this movie Soylent Green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic images (what you know, it looks like 1973), and lacks action. But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt and highly stratified society, and I was very pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson played such a moving and entertaining final role. The nice little moments of the characters, like when they share some lovely food with Heston, really make the movie. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's message is quite relevant these days, when nobody seems to know what the hell government is or the corporations are up to the task. Funny, is not it, to see Heston in a prototype movie by Michael Moore ...
