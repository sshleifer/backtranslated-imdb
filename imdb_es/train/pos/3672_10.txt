A simulated documentary about a couple of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), trying to make their first film in the late seventies. Hollywood North is the comic tale of their struggle to put everything together, despite a series of conflicting threads. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North works like a movie in a very similar way to why This Is Spinal Tap (1984) works very well. That is, although exaggerated in some way, it is very close to the truth, and the truth consists of "behind the scenes" facts that are very different from the public face of the industry. It is not easy to make a film, and it must have been especially difficult in Canada in the late seventies. Films involve dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Many have incompatible desires, motivations and personalities. Especially crucial are the financial and talent on the screen, because if you leave or can not be trusted at any stage while the film is in production, could jeopardize the whole issue, either by the need to make extensive filming or abandon the movie completely. <Br /> <br /> So it's not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on those kinds of relationships. The result is an excellent film that is at the same time hilarious and tragic. The script is impeccable and the performances are first class. This is a must see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of making movies. It should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a minimum of intelligence and a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 of me.
