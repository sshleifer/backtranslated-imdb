I will take my chances and defend "Shades of Gray" as a good episode of a video clip, which went into the fight for the life and death of Major William Thomas Riker, who was fighting a terminally terminal illness. <Br /> <br /> The scenes of the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the mood of Riker, as when he was reliving his romantic episodes as "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder" . Tragic moments were highlighted, such as the death of Tasha in "Skin of Evil", as well as elements of danger of pulsations in "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and the aforementioned "Skin of Evil". Riker also showed courage under fire by telling some funny jokes like "Once, a rattlesnake bit an ancestor of mine ... after 3 days of intense pain, the snake died". This episode highlighted Will Riker's terrible psychological experience under extreme duress. And, YES, my opinion is partial in proclaiming that "Shades of Gray" is a solid episode, because at the time of its original broadcast, my face was covered in sweat, wondering if Riker would withdraw from it with life and life. to see other great galactic adventures, beyond outer space beyond the final frontier ... <br /> <br /> Of course, in the following years, it seems that I formed a singular opinion of this particular episode .. But, if an award should go for "the best episode of a clip-show in the history of television", then I think this episode should be highly regarded in that regard.
