Stephen King was raised in films like this. -Flicks NO movies. <br /> <br /> Films like this and 'Jeepers Creepers' are "backsliding" from good drive-in horror movies. They are meant to be fun, cheap and hopefully: some good scars. <br /> <br /> Anyone looking for a theory about the human condition should convey this creature characteristic because that is all it is ... everything. It will always be. <br /> <br /> Stop destroying what has already been considered as garbage. - Good, fun, trash! <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed this, I recommend: 'Jeepers Creepers'' Jeepers Creepers 2 '' 30 Days of Night '' Scarecrows' ('88)' They Live '' Planet Terror '' Death Proof ' and 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch'
