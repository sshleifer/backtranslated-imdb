['Dramatic license: some hate it, although it is necessary to retell any story of life. In the case of &quot;Lucy&quot;, the main points of Lucille Ball&#39;s adolescence, the early career and the 20-year marriage to Desi Arnaz are all included, albeit in a truncated and reformulated manner. <br /><br /> The main emotional points of Lucy&#39;s life are clear: Lucille&#39;s struggle to find her niche as an actress, finally became the brilliant comedian who made the character Lucy Ricardo a legend; his turbulent, romantic and finally impossible marriage with Desi Arnaz; Lucy and Desi create the first television empire and secure their place in history as the most memorable comedy couple on television. <br /><br /> Like Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job. Do not expect to see the same miraculous transformation as Judy Davis did when playing with Judy Garland, but York makes Ball have a strong but pleasant will, and it&#39;s very fun in its own right. Even though her comedy time is different from Lucy&#39;s, she is still credible. The film never goes into much detail about her perfectionist behavior on set, and her mistreatment of Vivian Vance during the early years of &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; but seeing York portray Lucy rehearsing in private is a good inclusion. <br /><br /> Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi, but he has his own charm and does a mostly decent job with Desi&#39;s accent, especially in the opening scene. Madeline Zima was decent, if not too memorable, like the teenage Lucy. <br /><br /> Vivian Vance and William Frawley did not show much, fortunately, since Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in the roles. It&#39;s not that they are not good actors in their own right, they just were not so suitable for the people they played. Most of the actors were from Australia and New Zealand, and the repressed accents are sometimes detectable. <br /><br /> Although the main structure of the film adheres to the historical fact, there are many deviations, some for apparently inexplicable reasons. Jess Oppenheimer, the lead writer on Lucy&#39;s radio show &quot;My Favorite Husband,&quot; which began in 1948, appears in this film as a character who came onto the scene to help with &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in 1951, regardless of the fact that he was the main creator! This film also shows Marc Daniels as the principal director of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; throughout his career, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season. In addition, although I imagine that this was due to budgetary restrictions, it was shown that the Ricardo live in the same apartment throughout his stay in New York, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen game is a little bigger and It is out of scale. The original too. The Connecticut house looks pretty close to the original, except that the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. <br /><br /> There is also Desi talking about the purchase of RKO in 1953, during the Lucy incident, although the RKO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes might well have been for a dramatic license, and the film works to convey the main facts, but Would it have hurt to show a little more respect to Oppenheimer and Asher, two vital figures in the story of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;? The biggest mistake comes in the recreation scenes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, at least some of them. It is always risky to recreate something that is captured in the film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more so when OBVIOUS CHANGES are made. The scene with the giant loaf of bread was cut short, and anyone familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences immediately! The number of &quot;We are having a baby&quot; was also shortened, but apart from that, he was practically dead. By far, the best thing was the scene &quot;stepping on the grape&quot;, with Rachel York really nailing Lucy&#39;s gestures. The producers made the wise decision not to try to directly recreate the &quot;Vitametavegamin&quot; and the candy factory pieces, instead of showing the actors to rehearse them. These scenes proved effective because of that focus. <br /><br /> The main flaw of the film is that it is assumed that viewers already know a lot about Lucy&#39;s life, since it is omitted or omitted a lot. In general, however, it offers a decent portrait of Lucy and Desi&#39;s marriage, and errors of fact can be overlooked when character development works effectively.']
