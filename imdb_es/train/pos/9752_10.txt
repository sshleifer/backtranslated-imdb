I remember very well having seen this when I was 3 years old, then my parents accidentally recorded almost every second with some other cartoon. Then I was around 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and, since I could understand things better, I thought it was a good movie. I went forward only a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I rediscovered it thanks to some articles / video clips on the Internet and it is not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with children, but for us 20-30 there's something that definitely has "State of Worship" written on it. It is a pity that the original production has gone through a painful process; If Fox gave him enough time, he would probably be more recognized in today's public opinion. Maybe if they had to redo it with a totally different story and a stellar voice, it could be, but that has to be decided by Fox. I'm rambling here, I know. I still think it's a great movie, but it could be better than great.
