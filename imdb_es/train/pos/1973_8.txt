I never trust anyone's opinions regarding a movie. That also goes for the critics. Of course, if positive comments are obtained, it is fine and a point in favor, but most of the films that have important criticisms, I hate. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, an entertaining movie. It takes you out of your life for a couple of hours and takes you to a fictional character ... that's Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is amazing in this role, just as she was in the first. Anyone who says that is horrible in this movie must have felt the same in the first b / c, is back acting in the same way as in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is his and interprets it perfectly. Their one liners are great, like in the first one. Who can forget in the first movie when he tells the police: "If they will arrest me, do it ... otherwise, take the shit out of here!" Great scene, and believe me, do it again in this one. I was captivated by her. Your outfit, the way you smoked your cigarettes, believe me, it's worth the price just to see Stone's performance. I can not wait for this film to be released on DVD, without cuts, because I can only imagine the best it is going to be. And yes, there are many twists, as in the first, including the ending!
