Now he has a name, an identity, some memories and a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear, but even so, they tracked him down and destroyed the world he barely built. Now he wants an explanation and, for people to guide him, how he made him what he is. Yes, Jason Bourne is back, and this time, he's here to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie does not have the most elaborate script in the world, but its theme is very intelligent and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, like all Hollywood movies since the late 1990s, "The Bourne Suprematy" is a superhero story. Jason Bourne is like a Captain America project, which has been completely wrong. In the first film, the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second. Now he fights against what he considers evil, after a person close to him has been murdered (his girlfriend in "Suprematy") by them. That's all part of the history of superheroes, including a character with superpowers (realistic but still impressive: almost invincible). <br /> <br /> And the interesting point is that the evil with which he fights in the whole world. (there are no borders in the Bourne films, the characters go from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), is, as in the best seasons of "24", an American enemy, who believes he fights for good of his country blinds him completely. It's funny that the "crazy patriots" are now the N.1 enemies of Hollywood's paranoid stories. <br /> <br /> Besides all these interesting themes, the film is not impeccable: the feminine character of Nickie Parson is completely for the moment useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogue scenes. But all that really does not matter, for "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action movie. And the action scenes are pretty impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is talking about the "Waterloo scene" and the "Tanger search" and everyone's rights. I particularly enjoyed the fight in Tangier, which reminds me in its exaggeration and madness the works of Tsui Hark. Visually creative scenes, many intelligent action parts and a good reflection on the contemporary theme of the United States: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action movie.
