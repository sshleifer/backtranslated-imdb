This is an excellent movie by Sammo Hung. Actually, this is a great piece of Hong Kong action film. The story tells the story of the pedicab drivers in Macao who are looking for love and mingle with a vicious pimp. The performances are excellent and all the characters are nice and well defined. The story is involved and has enough romance, drama, comedy and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that he is probably the best choreographer in the fight in the business. The action is simply incredible, esp. The fight with Lau Kar Leung and the end. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are incredible. A must for any action fan.
