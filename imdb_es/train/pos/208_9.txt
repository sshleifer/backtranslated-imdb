The Sunshine Boys is an excellent comedy about two former vodevilians who reluctantly gather for a television special even though they despise each other. <br /> <br /> The comic book genius of two masters at work, George Burns and Walter Matthau are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the most insignificant nonsense! The material is fast-paced and ingenious, appealing to all ages. <br /> <br /> SPOILER MILD ALERT: There are some slightly sad moments towards the end of the film that indirectly deal with the effects of aging that the film gives. a soft, sincere and tenderness that shows this critic that what the couple most needs for success are the others. <br /> <br /> If someone loves The Odd Couple, you will love this movie. An excellent movie!
