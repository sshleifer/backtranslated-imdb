The last PPV of 2006 of the WWE proved to be a success among the fans, but only for one reason, the ladder match that was only programmed to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But since the recent PPV of the garbage was December to dismember, the WWE knew that it had to do something for the fans to talk again, this was useful when it introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz into the mix and announced that the game was going to be a stair party. <br /> <br /> The match was brutal and one of the best straight games I've seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a total disaster. Johnny Nitro did not even check his partner, they just continued as if nothing had happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the game, except to hit people with some shots on the stairs. In the end, London and Kendrick retained the titles. <br /> <br /> In another part of the program, Kane defeated MVP in a decent hell match when he set fire to the stupid MVP disguise. Chris Benoit knocked down Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the WWE cruiserweight title in a solid effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a total disaster, King Booker joined Finlay to face John dinner and batista The action was of poor quality and nobody cared what Batista chose for his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Kane defeated MVP in a hell fight. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained the WWE Tag team titles against The Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a straight game. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to retain the title of the United States in a decent game. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman defeated The Miz in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker defeated Kennedy in a last match. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in an abysmal match. <br /> <br /> General Grade - B
