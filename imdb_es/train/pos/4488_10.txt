Here is a favorite cartoon of Tom and Jerry, perfect for Halloween. I know he does not have much fear, but he has the 'trick' as in "Trick or Treat", as Jerry did to Tom with the window blind and the vacuum cleaner with a collared shirt that hung from it to look like a ghost ; But I still like to put it on my Halloween cartoon list. In this brief summary, Tom listened to "The hour of the witches", a program of ghost stories on the radio, and was scared by the horror story that was told. Halfway through history, the dramatic ones (with their hair standing up, their hearts jumping to their throats, chills in their spines) begin to happen to Tom. . . literally. And Jerry has been watching everything and laughing to himself, he thought it raised Tom's fears by scaring him. <br /> <br /> I love the ending, it was a little fun. And you know, this short is the first of the four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; the others are The Lonesome Mouse, A Mouse in the House and Nit-Witty Kitty. And also This short is the first of twenty-five cartoons where Tom talks. The others are The Lonesome Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, Mouse Trouble, The Mouse arrives at Dinner, Quiet Please !, Happy Trap, Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and The Cat Above and the Mouse Below directed by Chuck Jones.
