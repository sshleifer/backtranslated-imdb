I never saw this movie until I bought the tape last year. I was enthralled and entertained. It has all the elements of what I love to see in a science fiction story, in a book or on the screen. There are social commentaries, speculations and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something strange, and funny, seeing a 1936 vision of the "distant future" of the 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> I think it is a must, and not only for Sci-Fiers.
