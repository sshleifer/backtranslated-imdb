Disney (and the wonderful people of PIXAR, of course) offer a nice and fun story combined with the best of computer animation. I admit that maybe the 'faces' of the insects were a little more static than in 'Antz' and they only had four legs (in 'Antz' six ...). But the funds were excellent and the animation was impressive. But let this be a lesson: it was not the computer that made it so successful: it was the man behind the machine, who added the little twists I missed in 'Antz'. Some highlights were, of course, the 'bloopers' at the end (so keep watching at the end, it's worth it!), Which were fun and original. The line 'Filmed entirely in the location' was intended for the most attentive viewer.
