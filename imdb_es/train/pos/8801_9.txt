['This is the best movie I saw in 2002, while I&#39;m used to conventional movies. He is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. Because of the technical information (the elected directors), I was afraid it had an anti-American base, but ... it&#39;s a kind of (11 times) personal tribute. <br /><br /> The weakest point comes from Y. Chahine: he can not &quot;swallow his pride&quot; and considers this event a well-deserved punishment ... It is really the weakest part of the film, but this demonstrates a true freedom of speech for all the piece. The strangest thing comes from the Mexican film of almost conceptual art ... I&#39;m still not sure what A. Gonz√°lez Inarritu meant. The other 9 are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me smile, cry or even leave me dazed. I still do not know if the fable of S. Imamura is really related or not to the catastrophe of September 11, but it is so beautiful that its final place &quot;does&quot; it.']
