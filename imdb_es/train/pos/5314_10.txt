The first time I saw this movie at this year's Sundance Film Festival, and as a teenager, I found the movie quite attractive. These children are out of the ordinary and it is very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature, but with the correct dialogue and scrap they made the film a complete success. I enjoyed this movie more than others, but I highly recommend launching and watching this movie. It is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality. By capturing the essence of high school, the high school record has surpassed my favorite list and I hope it has the opportunity to be released to theaters. I really appreciate all the children who worked hard to make this movie, it helped me to cry and laugh.
