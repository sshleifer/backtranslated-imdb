This was a mandatory documentary for me when I lost the opportunity in 2004, so I was definitely going to watch the replay. I really liked the main character of the film because, this is true, I have a milder condition of the skin problem I had, epidermolysis bullosa dystrophic (EB). This is a sad, sometimes funny and very emotional documentary about a child with a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy speaks as a child (for losing vocal muscle) and never went through puberty, but is 36 years old. Most moments of sympathy are seeing their terrible condition and taking off the bandages. Jonny had a naughty sense of humor, even narrated from beyond the grave when he showed his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and Jonny supporter, Nell McAndrew. He won BAFTA for Best Editing and Best New Director (Factual), and was nominated for Best Sound (Real) and the Flaherty Documentary Award. It was number 10 in The 100 Greatest Treats 2004. You have to watch the documentary!
