['This was a wonderfully intelligent and entertaining movie that I will never tire of seeing many, many times. The cast was great in relating the youngsters to the older characters. Those of us who really appreciate the good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift for any type of production in which she stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is an excellent actress and it is a pleasure to watch her as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding image for most of the recently made moving images that lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. Film audiences need heroes, not deviant mannequins, who lack wit and talent. How wonderful it is to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this film win the awards it deserves. Thanks again for a tremendous night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, director, producer and all those who did an excellent job.']
