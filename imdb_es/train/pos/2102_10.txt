When I sat down to watch 'Largo Winch' I expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I stood up, I saw both; and more. <br /> <br /> Karl Roden was not finally the antagonist of a movie to begin with. Kristin Scott Thomas played her role well, but the two real stars in my opinion were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both acting excellently. In Radivoje, Bukvic represented Goran well. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the film, but I understand why people get bored with it. <br /> <br /> The scenery of Hong Kong and especially the stunning Croatian coast surprised me, and I almost did not want to look away from the screen when Largo entered the incredibly beautiful island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500, and BMW 7; if someone likes expensive limousine cars; This is his movie It is also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extreme beauty and, above all, a well written, fast-paced action movie, with dazzling combats and an internal drama completely braided. <br /> <br /> My vote, as illuminated by a gloomy day is: 10/10
