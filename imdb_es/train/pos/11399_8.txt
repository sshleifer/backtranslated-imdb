Well, then the plot is in an unstable terrain. Yes, that's fine, so there are some sequences of songs and / or dances inserted randomly (for example: Adam's concert and Henri's theatrical act). And Leslie Caron can not really, um, you know ... act. <br /> <br /> But somehow, 'An American In Paris' manages to go through all this as a polished and top-notch musical ... To a large extent based on the incredible talent and dance choreography of Gene Kelly, and the trucks full of charm that seems to matter in every scene with Caron. (He needs to, because he seems to have a ... problem with emotions.) <br /> <br /> The most accomplished and technically impressive number in this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet towards the end of the movie . It's incredibly filmed, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite number would have to be the character of Kelly singing "I Got Rhythm" with a group of children from the French school, and then breaking into a series of American dances. It only goes to show that you do not need special effects when you have a real * talent *. <br /> <br /> Not on the 'classic' level with 'Singin' In The Rain ', but on top of it, though. It's worth the watch!
