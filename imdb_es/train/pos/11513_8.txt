One of my favorite shows in the 70's. As I remember, it aired on Friday (or possibly Saturday) at night on Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together. <br /> <br /> Each episode usually reached a climax with Kolchack having to participate in hand-to-hand combat with some kind of supernatural opponent. To their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get as far away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember an episode in which the adversary was the spirit of a former Indian chief who / who 'came back' as a massive electric current that started killing people in a city hospital. In the final showdown, Kolchack attempted to short-circuit the 'power beast' in the midst of an explosion of sparks and burning flames. Oh, well ... you had to be there at that time, but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always had a lot of energy and enthusiasm in his roles and this was one of the best. <br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a place in the TV "Hall of Fame". To quote Tony Vincenzo ... 'Kolchack, you're IN IT' ... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, 'IN IT'!
