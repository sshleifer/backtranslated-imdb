The zenith of two brilliant careers. David Lynch, best known for his less accessible material, creates a delicate and exquisite story around the most improbable premise. A man travels to see his brother separated. Having no other means of transport, your trip takes more than six weeks on a lawn mower. Richard Farnsworth, in his latest film, offers an amazingly layered performance and nuanced in the lead role. Dazedly beautiful in its exultation of little things, Straight Story is a classic movie experience that should not be missed. Sissy Spacek is notable as Farnsworth's daughter, a middle-aged disabled woman who lives with the loss of her children.
