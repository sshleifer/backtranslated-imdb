In my opinion, VIVAH is the best movie of 2006, coming from a director who has been successful throughout his career. I'm not very interested in romantic movies these days, because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and very predictable. However, I've seen this movie three times now ... and believe me it's an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional route, showing simple characters in a sensible and realistic story of the journey between commitment and marriage. The film entertains in all ways, as it can be reflected in what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In that sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya did her homework well and described a very realistic story in a highly entertaining and well-made film. <br /> <br /> Several sequences of this film capture your interest immediately: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the girlfriend (Amrita Rao), the way he tries to look at her without that is too obvious in front of him and his family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the atmosphere of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when he comes to see her, that is, a shy Shahid who does not know exactly what to talk about. about but pulling a decent conversation. Also the naive nature of Amrita, the limited eye contact, the timid features and the soft response to Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> * The emotional breakdown of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) when she feeds him at Shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law, instead of her uncle's beloved niece. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the film belongs to Amrita Rao at all times. The actress portrays Poonam's role with such conviction that you can not imagine someone else replacing her. It looks beautiful throughout the entire film, and portrays an innocent and timid traditional girl to perfection. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor also performs brilliantly. It offers a promising performance and proves that it is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to acting in a Sooraj R. Barjatya movie. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make a beautiful couple on the screen, without a doubt. Other characters: Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very good). <br /> <br /> In general, VIVAH offers what it promised, a well-made and realistic story of two families. The film has excellent performances, excellent story and excellent music to adapt to the film, in addition to being directed by the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. It is a must see!
