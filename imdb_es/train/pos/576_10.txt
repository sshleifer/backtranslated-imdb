this movie was just brilliant, cast, the stage, the story, the direction, they all really adapted to the role they played, and you can imagine being there, Robert Redford is an amazing actor and now he's the same director, Norman's father came from the same Scottish island like me, so I loved the fact that there was a real connection with this movie, the witty comments throughout the film were great, it was brilliant, so much so that I bought the movie as soon as it was published for retail and I recommend it to everyone to see it, and the fly fishing was amazing, really cried at the end, it was very sad, and you know what they say if you cry in a movie it must have been good, and this definitely was , also, congratulations For the two young children who played the role of Norman and Paul, they were great, children often fall out of the list of compliments, I think, because the stars that interpreted them They are all such a great profile for the whole movie, but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done, do not you think? The whole story was lovely because it was true and it was someone's life after all we shared with all of us.
