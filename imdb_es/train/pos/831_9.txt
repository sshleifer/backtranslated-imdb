I saw this movie when I had a limited release, mainly because of the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. It starts almost like a thriller, but progresses constantly in a hilarious job full of phrases and great comic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, although I say that this film is a comedy, do not forget that sometimes it has a heart and can be very moving when necessary. When I entered the theater I did not know what to expect much more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. When leaving the theater I felt very satisfied with the film and plan to see it again at a general premiere. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a big mustache.
