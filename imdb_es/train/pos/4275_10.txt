Actually I'm surprised there are so many comments about this movie. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a major American university. But nobody in the United States has heard of that, which is a real shame! The dynamic between people is what makes it fun and sad. They're stuck together on a long bus ride, somewhere that most of us have been! But I never had one like this! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where they stop for the funeral. Then, the man and the woman slip away to make some love in the forest, but everyone follows them to look without them knowing! Just when she raises her skirt and he penetrates her all the way, the drinking begins to hack and they realize that everyone is watching! Talk about surprised! But ... you really have to feel for them even if it's hilarious! When you see the ending, it's a bit ironic that they had fun while doing it. Serbian humor at its best!
