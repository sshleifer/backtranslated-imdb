I've seen this movie literally over 100 times ... it's absolutely full of entertainment! Powers Boothe gives stellar performance. As a fan of actors like William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981) I never thought that an actor could capture the "intensity" as Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe is Jim Jones ... this movie captures his best performance!
