I saw this independent film when I was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it so fun was that it was based on a real story, very funny! It has some great character actors in it too. Mindy Sterling is in her and she is very good. I loved her at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is great too. I remember him from Head of the Class. I'm tired of all the dark and nervous movies that are still being made. This is fun and light, and I can see it with my family and not be embarrassed. I keep checking to see when it will be released on DVD. I will definitely buy it.
