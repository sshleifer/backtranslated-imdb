Drenched between San Francisco and the Valiente Captains, two of the best parts of Spencer Tracy is this very curious film about the war and the effects it has on some people. They gave A Gun the stars Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only movie they did together and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Tone are a couple of recruits from the First World War, Tone is a weak character who almost passes the hill on the training field, but Tracy stops him. Tracy is still playing the kind of young and beloved Wallace Beery that MGM imagined for him when he was taken from Fox. <br /> <br /> On the front, Tone gets an opportunity and takes advantage of it when, during a fight, he manages to get to the tower of a church that looks down on a nest of German machine guns. He has already learned to shoot and a Sergeant from York. But Alvin C. York was never changed by the war, as Tone has done. <br /> <br /> Wounded in the fight Tone convalesces in a hospital with Gladys George taking care of him. Tracy goes on a trip to visit his friend and he and George get something. Later, when it is reported that Tracy has disappeared in action, Tone and George get married. Tracy is disconsolate when he returns and he finds out about the marriage, but he feels calm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is about Tone applying the wartime skills he has learned in the gangster trade. Now he's a hit man and George does not really know what he's doing. I think you can solve the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that caused me some problems is that I can not believe that Gladys George could not understand it. She is an intelligent girl from the street, her role is very similar to the one she played in The Roaring Twenties with James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, the development of Humphrey Bogart's character is similar to Tone's, although he was not the central character in the movie. In fact, there are elements of They Gave Him A Gun that are in Taxi Driver and Clint Eastwood's classic, The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences of the First World War are very well organized by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin criticized this movie, I think it is much better than he gave credit.
