Many Zorro movies have been made over the decades, but it is a pity that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Fighting Legion is a little different from other Fox movies. First, it is a series of the Republic in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a studio star such as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but by actor Reed Hadley, in the style of the workers. While Hadley does not have as strong a presence in the proceedings as the others, she does an adequate job, helped by the fact that she is not the only hero here; As the title indicates, it has a fight legion to invoke. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the scenario is not California. The story here takes place in central Mexico in 1824, where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous population of the Indians and a band of outlaws to help him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican republic. Something, Fox, and a handful of followers plan to do everything possible to stop him. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode, from the "twang" courage. Sound effects to the ridiculous performance. But in general, this represents one of the best Republic series of all time, and probably the best of Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most series and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering. Action: fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits taken from this series.
