I can safely admit (as an IMDb geek) that 'Phantom Lady' will never enter my top 20 movie. You can not even sneak into the top fifty. But instead of discrediting the film for not being as good as other classics of the noir genre, one should keep in mind that 'Phantom Lady' has enough strong and lasting images to make it worth seeing. All that is required of the spectator is the ability to go beyond the terribly slow start. <br /> <br /> The movie is not cooked until 'Kansas' (Ella Raines) tries to prove everything alone. The innocence of his boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who has been convicted of murder. 'Kansas' is Anderson's secretary during the day and the amateur detective at night. As a rookie detective, he manages pretty well while working at night in the streets of New York. Little by little, she begins to piece together a murder mystery. To be honest, the film belongs to Raines and it is only because of his presence that the film works well. Somehow, she is able to give life to a movie about a condemned man who is not interested in the least. I'm not sure that this divided dynamic of a characterless character becomes the fault of the actor or the director, but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> As interesting as Raines is as a rookie detective, things really accelerate to another hidden team when 'Kansas' makes a nighttime visit to a roving drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) in search of information for Help your condemned boss. She and the drummer paint the city with a new kind of red while they visit the jazz clubs "all night". Trying to describe this scene will be an injustice to the scene or, worse, could ruin the scene altogether. You will know the scene once the last crash of cymbals has finished playing. If you are lucky enough to have this movie on DVD, it is very likely that you are rewinding this scene over and over again. As good as Raines is, it is this scene that makes this film worthy of mention. It is mainly due to this scene that I call 'Phantom Lady' with a 7 instead of a 6. <br /> <br /> For the most part, this film is presented as lukewarm and bland with some great scenes and a scene magnificent . It's the 'drum / sex scene' that separates this film from any other of the same kind. <br /> <br /> And as it is said in the movie that "you never go wrong with Vanilla", I would also like to add that "going with vanilla" is the safe option when one can not decide to have more taste tasty. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
