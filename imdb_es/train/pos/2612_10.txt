This is a movie that was very well made. I had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and I've been waiting for its release! Greetings to the director and all the actors. The cast of support gave Eva Méndez what she needed to take this to the top. As everyone else here says, the last part of the movie is fascinating. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with her character, since she had not done a lot of work when this movie was made. She has enough career ahead. I was surprised by his performance. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, questioned my values ​​in life and priorities, and I am a better person for it! A great message is inside the movie. Free it so that everyone can enjoy!
