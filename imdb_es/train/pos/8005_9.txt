['I bought this game on eBay after hearing it was a game similar to Elite. The gameplay is very similar, and it is very addictive. Once I played it a couple of times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all my kids so they could also join in the fun ... I played this game right away and the story makes it feel like If you&#39;re really in a movie, it&#39;s brilliant. If you have trouble freely exploring due to the restrictive nature of the story in the single player game, simply set up a Freelancer server on your own PC (easy to do and the software is included) and play the most content. There are still a lot of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so the multiplayer mode is not a problem and it is not that threatening, because often you do not mean other players unless you want to. So get a copy of this game, learn by playing in the single-player campaign, then set up an online presence and have fun. The depth of this game is amazing, with huge systems to explore and ruins to find, as well as all kinds of things to discover: hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost infinite. Fantastic game and especially because you can get it for a couple of pounds on eBay. Get one with the full written manual if you can (blue box, no red box Xplosiv), it&#39;s much better!']
