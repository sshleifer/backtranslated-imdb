Let's clarify one thing: this film does not seek to redefine the genre, it is not Dr. Strangelove or Young Frankenstein. It's a silly movie, with three great female protagonists (I do not remember any other comedy with similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL and the indie queen Parker Posey, as charming as ever. The story is basic: the three girls were "losers" in college, and still chase him. Poehler is a dog trainer (he can not even get a date with a blind man), Posey is an assistant to a senator (who "has not been touched by a man since Clinton was in office" ... I realized of that One several minutes later ... I'm a bit slow, okay!), and Dracht has a gay girlfriend (Seth Meyers SNL, funny). They have to prevent the "outstanding" daughter of the senator (the always cute Amber Tamblyn of the television series "Joan of Arcadia") from embarrassing her during spring break. So, of course, they have to go watch it, and there is some hilarity. In short, a light comedy, simple, quite short and quite pleasant.
