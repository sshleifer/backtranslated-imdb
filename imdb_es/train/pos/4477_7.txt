This has much in its favor: Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten and a smaller amount of scum, Iturbi, Grayson, plus a little buzz, Kelly. It was Sinatra's first real movie in which the producer spent a dollar and could be seen on the screen (he had previously appeared on two low budget, Higher And Higher and Step Lively), but if only they had relied on Sinatra tubes and Deep Six Grayson plus Iturbi's ego on piano pianos would have left us with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for Sinatra. As it is, he scores heavily on all his songs from the two duets with Kelly - We Hate To Leave, I begged - his own solos, What Makes The Sunset, The Charm Of You and I Fall In Love too easily. Despite this, Step Lively is still the best Sinatra musical of the forties with a tenth of the budget.
