The name of this movie just made me want to see what it was, so I recorded this movie during the first hours of the morning. If you ever wanted to see what the miners had to go through during the first days and really see a dramatic scene when the mine collapses in men. This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after the First World War and how the Germans helped the French miners to a great extent to the disbelief of French citizens. All the actors were outstanding, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small boy who worked in the mine. There is an old and old retired miner who goes down the stairs when the elevator breaks down. If you are a true movie fan, this is a movie you do not want to miss.
