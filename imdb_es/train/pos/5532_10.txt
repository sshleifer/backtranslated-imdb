Maybe I am predisposed to foxes, to fox stories and all, but I thought that this was done wonderfully. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed what was shown when Lily was not comfortable, like the fire and the room (trying not to spoil much here). I think it's important for children to see and try to understand. <br /> <br /> After reading some more comments, I am a bit confused, one says that in the end -sopista- the mother and her son appear, as she was the one who told her son her story. The film I saw had NO mother or child at the end, just a painting of a girl with a fox. Can someone enlighten me about that? Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes may be a bit slow, which can be difficult for children with a lot of energy. It's still worth it if you can sit still.
