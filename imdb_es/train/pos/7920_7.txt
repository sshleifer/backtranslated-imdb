Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is your normal high school average boy. Preparing for the big welcome game, the problems of the bride and hair growth in strange places, you know the usual. But the hair in strange places goes a little out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with an evil case of the lanterns. Now, condemned to walk the world forever young as a werewolf, how will Adam get any girl? <br /> <br /> 'Full Moon High' is not often spoken, but it is a silly and entertaining parody of terror. Larry Cohen (Q the Winged Serpent, The Stuff) incorporates as many gags as possible writers / directors. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows a good moment in the main role. If you're a fan of parodies like 'Airplane' and 'Student Bodies', I think you'll have fun with this festival of laughter.
