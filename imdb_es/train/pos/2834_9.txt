I have not seen much German comedy, but if this movie is something to pass, I'm bound to see more! The simple but effective story takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, an unemployed mother of two, discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. I will not reveal anything else, but what results is a series of very funny events with the perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has expanded since the first time I saw this movie. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... do not let the inclusion of young children deceive you into believing it is a family movie) who love comedy, even those who are not familiar with the language.
