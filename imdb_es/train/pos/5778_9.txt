Despite its budgetary limitations, this is a great movie, proof that effort and imagination can overcome the lack of cash. The opening, in which rock paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived in the era of human beings, is a good false trail. After that, a meteor descends into a lake and causes heat that, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (perhaps cave paintings suggest that this is not the first time something like this has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it is a well-animated Plesiosaurus that is soon causing disappearances in the local area. Well, then it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still a genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies.
