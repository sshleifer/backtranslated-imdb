The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. In short, the movie was spectacularly average. It's not bad, but it's not really good. The edition is good; The movie is well accelerated. The management is competent and insured. The story is hard. The film is performed on average by Ledger, Bloom and the great Watts and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you are from the United States, so sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the movie, I was not bored or moved. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I have to say that I did not care at that point. <br /> <br /> Actually, the only reason why I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom shows some kind of scope (although most of the current "I'm pretty and confused" aspect is prominent), because what the fangirls may find it is worth paying the price of the session. Apart from that, I just do not see it. It is not good enough or bad enough to entertain.
