This was one of my favorite series when I was a kid. The Swedish Broadcasting Company decided to broadcast it once more a couple of summers when I had just finished my first semester of medical school. I was surprised to see the depth in which the organs were explained. Sure, some things are simplified, but most of them were correct (although they were made 22 years ago!) And they are quite understandable. I would suggest that all future medical students should see it. It is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words, for example. Now I'm in my seventh semester and I think I'll see the series again as soon as I buy the DVD box :-)
