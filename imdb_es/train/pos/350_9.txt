I wanted to see Valentine since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were there because they had played in some of my favorite movies. When I saw Valentine, I was surprised at how great the story was. It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all. The actors and actresses beautifully interpreted the parts and the way they ended was so brilliant and cunning. Some scenes were a bit incredible or bad, and I admit that in some minor parts it got a bit boring, but overall it was entertaining and full of suspense. He had a story line that made you think and made you guess all the way and did not deserve all the crap he received. I recommend this movie to watch at any time, but especially on Valentine's Day because it will surely give you a lot of chills. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the trailer OR to the classification, please, NO ...
