Born in Berlin in 1942, Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and is now a very important director and writer. She has been described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as a director whose commitment to bring a woman's sensibility to the screen surpasses her artistic strengths. "Rosenstrasse," which has garnered mixed and even bizarre reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most aggressive criticisms I've read in that article) is not a perfect movie. It is a good film and a testimony to a rare fusion of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by all the peoples, generically impotent Germans who manifest themselves in a Berlin street. <br /> <br /> The co-writer von Trotta uses the The real Rosenstrasse incident in the context of the search of a young woman for information about the life of her mother was never revealed in the German capital during World War II . <br /> <br /> Ruth Weinstein's husband (Jutta Lampe) passed away and in a surprising reversal to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle, apparently hitherto suspended, Ruth not only "feels shivah" (the mourning ritual one week of the Jews) but insists on following the strict proscriptions of their faith. His apartment in New York City reflects the wealth secured by the labors of his late wife. His US-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a little disappointed that Mom took on the restrictive orthodox Jewish practices, but they collaborate. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fianc√©, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis could explode, since Ruth warns that she will reject Hannah if she does not stop being affectionate, the handsome Luis. Pay attention. <br /> <br /> A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also gives clues to a Hannah interested in a wartime mystery about Mom's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued; he asks his mother, who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of his life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I met many children whose families, in general but usually in part, escaped the Holocaust. Those days simply were not discussed. <br /> <br /> Then, Hannah, upon learning that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life, goes to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. Otherwise, this would have been a very short movie. But Ruth, who claims to be a historian, locates Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), 90, now a widow. As the happy to be interviewed, but shocked by the repressed memories of Lena tells her story, the scenes change almost perfectly between the current Berlin and the capital of war. <br /> <br /> The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann was a good pianist married to a Jewish violinist, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel) .With the advent of the Nazi regime, she was asked to use "Israel" as the second name, as well as Jewish women had to add "Sarah" to their names (by the way, I would like that IMDb would not have given the name of Fabian in their list of characters with the false "Israel" included, simply perpetuates a name applied by the Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation. <br /> <br /> While Germany deported the majority of its Jewish population to the concentration camps, those married to "Aryans" were exempt for a time. when the regime decided to take them too (most were men, a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews) The summary is shown here in all its terrifying intensity. <br /> <br /> Young Lena tries to locate her husband, everything that she and many after women they know they are confined in a building in Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women accumulates, some seek help from the German officers who, as expected, reject the help and also verbally abuse them ("a bitch lover of the Jews" is a denomination). As a secondary plot, Lena adopts more or less Ruth, eight years old, who hid when her mother was kidnapped (remember, Ruth is now sitting in Shiva in Manhattan). The girl Ruth is portrayed by Svea Lohde. <br /> <br /> Through increasingly angry protests women finally prevail. The men, and a handful of women, are released. As in the real story, the Nazis yielded, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the madmen recognized the defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the completion of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mentally handicapped and disabled people chronic, but that's another story). ). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta increases the tension and the story of each woman is personal and universal. Hannah continues to incite old Lena that slowly, one gathers, begins to suspect that she is not dealing with a common historian, but with someone who needs to learn about the girl she rescued, the girl whose mother was murdered. <br /> <br /> The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943, a set and today's street in a unified, reconstructed and unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin has the heritage, but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta points it out very well. <br /> <br /> The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband, although strong, is also shown to be totally helpless in the confinement trap with a likely prospect of deportation (which shows that all the characters, including the local police and the military, have clearly understood it as a one-way trip). forgotten) . The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy life in New York. Hannah is very credible as a young woman whose father's death triggers the need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although the Times criticism seems not to know). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta's hand is safe but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels in an evening enjoying Lena's violin is unnecessary and distracted. The suggestion that she may have slept with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical and high-level Hitler worshiper, to save her husband is subtracted from the marvelous achievement of the spouses and relatives of the protesters. Most of the German officers come from the central foundry and are molded by Erich von Stroheim's "copy and paste" school of Teutonic wickedness. But that is understandable. <br /> <br /> The history of Rosenstrasse has been the subject of books and articles, and some claim that it is a paradigmatic case to argue that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument does not make sense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse became deeply and understandably interested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. That is why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually unique. Whether one buys or rejects Goldenhagen's thesis that most Germans were accomplices to the royal murderers, it can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 onwards. <br /> <br /> The old Lena says that what the women achieved was "a ray of light" at a bad time. Most of the men and women who emerged from a near-death trip survived the war. So it was "a ray of light" and von Trotta's film is a beacon of enlightenment that shows that some were saved by the courage of mostly ordinary women and that for every life saved there is an occasion to celebrate. And we always will. <br /> <br /> 9/10
