How could I miss the opportunity to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not and, then, I rented this mess from a movie. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I discovered about the legend of this young man. I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Maybe the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it is a bit slow, I found this story difficult to follow. Not because history is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I feel sorry for recommending this as a must see, it is a great story in the history of Australia (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film has Some sequences of good sequences. <br /> <br /> 6/10 see it for historical value ... (yes, of course ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;))
