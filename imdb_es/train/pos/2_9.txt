Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant. Written by experts and delivered perfectly, this searing parody of students and teachers at a public school in South London literally leaves you to laugh. It is vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. The characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of British society (or, to be more precise, of any society). Following the adventures of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for lack of a better term, the show is not afraid to parody all imaginable themes. Political correctness flies through the window in every episode. If you like programs that are not afraid to make fun of all the taboo subjects imaginable, Bromwell High will not disappoint you!
