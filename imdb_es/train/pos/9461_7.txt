Steve Carell plays a person with whom you can relate (more or less) in Dan in real life, a film that I hoped I would not like but ended up liking me. It's not that the movie laughs out loud, it's just that it has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, this is not what The Office fans expect to see of him, but you know what, I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell plays Dan Burns, a widowed father whose daughters really do not want him. One weekend, he and his daughters travel to see their family. While there, he goes to a bookstore and falls in love with a woman. When he returns home, he discovers that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) is dating this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Dan in real life, sometimes, I discovered a little bit amazing. Is the Burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do many other things in the family? I would doubt it very much. I do not know any family that is like that. Is that preventing me from giving a thumbs up? No. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life: *** / ****
