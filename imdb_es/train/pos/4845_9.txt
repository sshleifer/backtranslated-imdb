['Hello friends. I recently saw this movie for the first time and it is also my first Arthur Askey experience. I must admit that I was very impressed by this movie. As a fan of black and white films in general, passport to pimlico, Lavender Hill mafia and Tommy Trinder (who apparently is a distant relative), this film attracted attention because it provided good British humor. I realize that there are some here who have criticized the performance of Askey, however, in my opinion, it is the test of time as a good example of the comic performance of the forties and if something is added to the image when creating characters that are more than mere stereotypes that seems to dominate the movies now. If you can get this movie, I would recommend that you get it, it&#39;s a pity that these movies usually do not show up on Sunday afternoons. I&#39;m also glad I had the chance to see another piece. of the work of Arnold Ridley (Godfrey deprived in dad&#39;s army). I thank you']
