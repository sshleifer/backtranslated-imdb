Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to look like Elvis in the entertainment world, many things were false in this movie. First, the manufacturers claimed that Elvis opened his famous live shows in '69 after 9 years of filming with a white suit made in 1972. They also claimed that he sang the "ardent love" that he sang for the first time in 1972 and 'the wonder of you', which he recorded for the first time in 1970. They also claim that he got his first guitar for Christmas when all Elvis fans know he got it for his birthday. I know that all movies based on the past have something false, but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.
