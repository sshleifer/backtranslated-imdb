"Rich in Love" is a movie from a segment of life that takes the viewer to the footsteps of a somewhat extravagant family in Charleston, South Carolina. Highly romantic, beautifully filmed, well written and acted, "RIL" envelops you like a summer breeze, since its sinuous plot gives life to the characters, so that at the end of the film you will feel like an old friend of the family. <Br /> <br /> A beautifully crafted film directed by characters from the director of "Driving Miss Daisy", "RIL" is a little "dark" unattractive that will appeal to more mature audiences.
