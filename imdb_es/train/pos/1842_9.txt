The Series 2 has had a great start! I do not think you should have seen the series 1 to understand what is happening, but as with any other series, it is good to have an idea of ​​the characters and worry about what happens to them. And this show makes you think like that! These women of 4 and 30 years seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives, but the premise is credible and realistic. So the twists and turns that come through their love and sexual lives are exciting to watch, but they also know that these are problems that also happen to real women. It's about the choices we make as women and how they sometimes lead us down certain paths in our lives instead of consciously making those choices!
