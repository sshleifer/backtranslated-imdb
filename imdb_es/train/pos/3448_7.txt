A documentary without loss of words ... never ... <br /> <br /> Suppose that the narration is more than a parody, suppose it is a comment on Japanese society. And as this film is as fast as an absurd documentary as it comes, the constant wordplay, how fast it goes, and as poorly translated as it is, in its current version of the festival as seen tonight at the Cinematek in Copenhagen. .. It is still quite nice. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and ONLY for truly sincere and open patients, I speak to the Jim Jarmusch fans with relapses in ADD, I think this is a movie for you. It's a smart movie if you let me win you. <br /> <br /> Pretty beautiful, pretty kitsch, and a pretty Japanese subculture. And pretty experimental. 2D Static in a 3D world. In short, fun for those who want to see a Japanese movie that falsifies the Japanese culinary culture. A thumbs up if you're in the mood for something completely different.
