Have you ever read Jim Thompson? It is a hard boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I have found. Rarely are private detectives at work, only losers, psychotics, and small-time swindlers. This movie has been nailed by Thompson: "If God made any real mistake in this world, it was to give us a will to live when we have no excuse for it." All the characters in the film swing on the edge of a knife between surreal realism and creepy realism. There is a sleazy and deceptive Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and Doc Goldman by George Dickerson. Jason Patric offers a wonderful, often poignant performance, like Kid Collins, a former not too bright and shy fighter who is more afraid of himself than of anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy woman we can not understand ... It's not your classic movie, nor does it pretend to be. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
