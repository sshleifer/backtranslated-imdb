This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. All of you who consider this film an absolute thing, obviously are not smart enough to grasp all the subtle humor that this film has to offer. It shows us that real life and "fictitious" action can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the smartest ways for two people to meet each other. Tell me another movie where you can see all that, as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like "They're going to find your anus on a mountain on Mars."
