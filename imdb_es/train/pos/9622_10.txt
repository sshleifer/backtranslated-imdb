I just watched this movie on Showtime. Quite by accident actually. If I had not slept for only 6 hours during the last two days, then I would not have returned home before work. If I had not come home early from work, I would not have seen this movie. I would not have known what I was missing, but I would have missed a lot. <br /> <br /> This is how it is. He's almost playing in the Kevin Bacon effect. That and causality (hence my verbiage above). Each character is intertwined in some way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, not interaction. This movie is simply wonderful. I'm going to have to find a copy to buy.
