Some saying about "The game is the most important thing", or something like that, is attributed to that old bard of Avon, William Shakewspeare himself. If it was not old Will, it could well have been our own super veteran filmmaker, Mr. Raoul Walsh. There are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis. None is more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The Film also accumulates another award, being named Errol Flynn's favorite of its own stellar vehicles. Clearly, it provides evidence on the screen that would easily take viewers sitting in the dark theater, or watching them on their TV or DVD from home, to conclude that it is the same. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the story is a semi-serious story. Biopic, which takes a part of the objective material and combines it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to give us a very satisfactory event, although somewhat fictitious (what is Biopic not?). <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, as it makes good use of the natural athleticism of our leadership, Mr. Errol Flynn. Although not a Swashbuckler, a Western or a War Picture, this GENTLEMAN JIM is perhaps the leading role that was best suited to the tough Australian. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Boxing Team in either 1928 or 1932. His training and skills in 'sweet science' are clearly evident throughout the film and especially in the "Big Fight" "for the World Heavyweight Boxing Championship with the great John L. Sullivan, Himself (played expertly by Ward Bond) The cast reads like a list of duties of Warner Brothers resident support players. Present Alan Hale as the father of Jim Corbet, a Livery Wagon operator *. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), the two 'blue-collar' men of the family, and their occupations declare themselves as 'Longshormen'. <br /> <br /> The great Jack Carson does his thing. usual serious-comic masterful acting in support as Jim Corbett's friend and bank teller fellow. The rest of those we can recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Minor Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, Dorothy Vaughn, to name just a few. <br /> <br /> Director Walsh also used a series of Pro fighters in the roles of several boxers. Therefore, we have Ed "Strangler" Lewis and an unknown Grappler * who present themselves as the two pug of the waterfront in the opening scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (have you heard about him?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These boys had a powerful, but unpolished, appearance that the old wrestlers of Pier 9 would have possessed. <br /> <br /> We have not forgotten Leading Lady, Alexis Smith. She is powerful in her characterization of an "independent" woman, but she maintains enough true skill as a comic player in many of the scenes. She shows a great variety in her part as poor rich girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients at hand, the trick is how to mix the elements in the right proportions to give you the 'right' 'mix. Well, director Walsh does it with reckless abandon. Because he is looking, above all, for a great movie. His treatment shows all the skills he had perfected to a fine adjustment starting with his days as a player with D.W. Griffith. Mr. Walsh seems to have a special fondness for that period, the 1890s. *** Mr. Walsh's address moves through the script at a fairly fast pace, breaking the scenes of the exhibition with a joke line humorous, "the Corbetts are in again!" Therefore, he is able to maintain a light touch, even humorous, in a story that could become too monotonous and serious. <br /> <br /> In addition, in an almost unnoticed element, Brother Walsh gives us the authentic aspect of a San Francisco from the 1890s. And as another example of his fondness for that period, he creates broad images and dynamics of the historical prize fights. There is a vibrant and joyful mood transmitted in those boxing scenes. To crown the glory of this great film, perhaps underestimated, Director Walsh gave the image an aspect as if it were an illustration of The Police Gazette, which covered such events in those "old days". <br /> <br /> But there's only one thing to remember before seeing it. If it's the first time, or if you see it one more time: <br /> <br /> "THE CORBETS ARE IN THE NEW!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion as a historian of both Film and Pro Wrestling, it seems that Tor Johnson, who years later was one of the favorites of Director Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> ** A 'livery' is a somewhat archaic term for a rental vehicle for locals. transportation of the city. <br /> <br /> *** It's true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was a veteran player of Griffith. He was the actor who played John Wilkes Booth in THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915). <br /> <br /> **** Born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890s and Combat for the Sullivan-Corbett Championship and what it meant for Sporting Life in the America of those days.
