I did not have much interest in seeing The Flock. Andrew Lau co-directed the trilogy of Infernal Affairs, but he had been fired from The Flock and replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. He had the feeling that Lau had made a good movie but he had not satisfied the studio, so they fired him and hired another director. This usually does not work well (remember The Invasion). But The Flock turned out to be better than I expected. It's not a great movie, but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller. The development of the character is very well done and could know the characters very well. In addition, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible. Richard Gere and Claire Danes provide competent performances. Now, let's go to the negative points. One element that really bothered me (there was a time when I was irritated) was the excess of editing tricks to give the film more "attitude" and style. These tricks feel out of place and His presence is arbitrary. Also, I think the movie should have been more ambitious. Despite that, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It is not memorable at all, but it is entertaining.
