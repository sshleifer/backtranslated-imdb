['I remember seeing this late at night on black and white television, long before a live action version was as much as a glitter in the eyes of Peter Jackson ... and I was very impressed. Finally, this week I had my hands on a VHS copy that was being thrown away (and is not that just a couple of the course ...?) I had the opportunity to revisit this movie and found out that it still holds up pretty well, Although it is not the success that painted the memory. <br /><br /> I have to confess a certain bias here. Some critics announce themselves as confirmed lovers of Jackson, others as lovers of Jackson; I&#39;m not exactly either. I was a devotee of Brian Sibley&#39;s BBC Radio adaptation, originally broadcast in 1981, and I instantly recognized Gollum&#39;s voice here: Peter Woodthorpe will repeat this performance almost as a perfect note for the radio three years later. <br /><br /> I must say, however, that where I found Jackson&#39;s films to be an increasingly indulgent disappointment, Bakshi&#39;s version, for all that has been done seriously, is actually more accurate. Yes, there are the usual and understandable changes (here is Legolas instead of Arwen who replaces Glorfindel as the Elf sent from Rivendell to meet with the group) and there are a lot of telescopes in the action. (The only exception to the latter, as others have pointed out, is the strangely extended sequence at the Rivendell ford, where the Ringwraiths, which have demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and withdraw Frodo in mid-flight, deploy again when he challenges them after crossing the river, then, for some inexplicable reason, simply chase him in a prolonged straight gallop, which initially is a nightmare but meaningless, as to the plot, and definitely continues too.) I would also agree in which the Balrog is unsatisfactory, due in part to a bad animation, and that Gandalf grinds his arms too much. <br /><br /> But having seen the two approaches to the film, I feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take. In a story that is half myth (oddly enough, a thing that is included is a fragment of the story of Beren and Luthien de Aragorn) the extreme literalism that requires live action filming, where everything must be created, from monsters even mail shirts. in detail to appear in the camera, it is counterproductive: latex-faced monsters (or CGI) are less monstrous than drawn forms, heroic disguises tend to look quite silly in real bodies, and hobbits or dwarves with non-human bodies. Proportions are easy to animate but difficult to film convincingly. Many critics have cited Ringwraith&#39;s vacuum in the forest, with his crippled and half-human movements, as one of the film&#39;s most terrifying moments: it certainly scared me when I first saw him alone in the dark! <br /><br /> The extreme stylization of the introduction (plus a voiceover made with great skill and economy to summarize the background story in a few sentences) works very well to represent an almost mythical era, and the change to the rustic style of the comic of La Comarca I particularly like the Proudfeet, it corresponds to the similar change in the tone of Tolkien&#39;s prose. I felt that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of the animation could have been used to great effect: Gandalf threatening Bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes, Bilbo seemed to become a creature similar to Gollum under the influence of the Lust of the Ring . in Rivendell, and Galadriel&#39;s famous discourse of temptation was drawn more or less directly, where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the changed perceptions of hobbits. But, in general, the changes in detail and in the palette: shades of firelight in Bree, bright colors re-emerging in Rivendell and in the Fangorn clearing, dirty grays and browns for Moria and desolate lands, work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes, where a live action approach simply does not allow you to blur the background or the sketch in a stylized configuration. <br /><br /> As a fan I did not mind the representation of Lothlorien by Jackson or Bakshi; again, I feel that the soundscape of the radio was the best evocation I have found of a beautiful and strange wooded paradise stuck out of time, and I feel that Bakshi made the elves sing at this point rather badly, but I like the little montage at this point it shows the various members of the Company who relax together after their tribulations in Moria. Aragorn who gives a hobbit fencing lesson here is such a charming (and equally non-canonical) show as Boromir&#39;s engaging with Hobbits in Hollin in Jackson&#39;s version. <br /><br /> Aragorn&#39;s description as a convincingly weather-driven Ranger is good throughout this movie (Viggo Mortensen&#39;s disheveled appearance, Jesus did not work for me), although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to &quot;clean up&quot; the character in the second half for the benefit of Gondor. John Hurt, as expected, offers an excellent vocal performance, as does a resounding William Squire on the part of Gandalf. I suspect that the hobbits intend to reflect contemporary youth as figures of public identification: I find that the animated style (its proportions are much more &quot;caricatured&quot; than those of the human characters) works well to differentiate them, and the whole &quot; hairy &quot;The thing of the feet as it is drawn here is much more plausible than in more literal representations, including much fan art. <br /><br /> Personally, I have fewer objections to Boromir as a Viking, who was always a rather petty guy, than to beardy-Aragorn (illogical: both were Numenorians, after all), although I am clearly in a minority here! <br /><br /> The big flaw in this image will always be the fact that it was an unfinished project, with a strange tack that ended up trying to solve the problems. A pity It would have been interesting, not to mention less frustrating, to see what Bakshi planned to do on Shelob and Minas Tirith, not caring about the dead ...']
