What a great movie by Barbara Stanwyck that I saw by chance the other night. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for double tickets, but it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and her son (Lee Aaker) drive to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation. The husband falls off the pier and the only way to save him is if Barbara returns to a garage by a rope. <br /> <br /> While there he meets a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker, one of my favorites) and what follows is a game of cat and mouse while Barbara tries everything in her power to make Meeker go back with her to free her husband. <br /> <br /> The movie was so exciting and so amazing. - I was not expecting a great movie. But I suppose I should have realized: is there anything that Barbara Stanwyck makes less than wonderful?
