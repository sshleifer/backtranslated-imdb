Sweet and charming, funny and moving, less significant but significant plot, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third film by Richard Linklater, is dedicated to all those who have been in love, are in love or have never been in love but still dream. of that and hope to find it. It is one of the very rare films that is / should / will be equally interesting for teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It looks like a very simple little movie without spectacular visual effects, car chases or long, steamy sex scenes. Two 20-year-olds, two university students (the American tourist Ethan Hawke who returns home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend classes at the Sorbonne) meet in a train. They are attracted to each other instantly, even before they start talking, they jump off the train in Vienna, where they walk exploring the city all night. They talk and they fall in love. That's right, that's the movie. It could have been boring and silly, but instead, it is a charming, believable, intelligent and moving romance that only improves with each visualization (at least for this viewer). The great compliments and my sincere gratitude go to the director and the writers for offering two charming characters, excellent writing, always interesting and witty dialogues, two amazing performances and the atmosphere of magic that is falling in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like Botticelli's angel, is excellent at portraying an intelligent, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
