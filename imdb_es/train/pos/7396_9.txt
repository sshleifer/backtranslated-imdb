['Another outstanding foreign film that torments in depth the endless crop of crud that emanates from Hollywood! This is a story of life and life. No, it&#39;s definitely not the perfect little life that is represented so often in the totally artificial Hollywood movies, but rather, the real life with real characters, each with strengths and weaknesses, just like the real people in our lives and in ourselves. <br /><br /> The dynamics of all these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse, and in particular of its former owner, are magnificent, moving and very stimulating. <br /><br /> Sit, relax and let yourself be carried away by the simple and beautiful life. There is a real wisdom to learn in this movie if you just open up to it. <br /><br /> You will not be disappointed.']
