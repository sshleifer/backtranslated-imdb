Gray Gardens was exciting and crazy and you really could not look the other way. He was so strange, and funny, sad and sick, and really there are no words to describe. The Gray Gardens movement is more than strange. I discovered that this movie was reading my uncle John's Great Great Bathroom Reader, at the Bath Reader Institute, and it was worth it to rent it and climb to the top of the movie line. This film is about the most eccentric and crazy people that have been filmed. One should see it for their favorite Edie outfits, which I'm sure include curtains. When I grow old, I almost want to be like Big Edie, touching my nose normally and with society.
