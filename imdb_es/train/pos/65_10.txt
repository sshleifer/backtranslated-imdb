This movie is not just about a school shooting, in fact, it has never been seen. But that only increases the power of this movie. It's about people and how they treat tragedy. I know that it was shown to the students who survived the Columbine shooting and provided a sense of closure for many of them. The acting is excellent. The three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles ... I recommend this movie to anyone. It's one of those movies that makes you talk about that after seeing it. It provokes the discussion not only of school shots, but also of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It is a heartbreaking tear, but it is worth it and one will see it again and again.
