I managed to record this on my satellite, but I would love to get an original version in a format that we can use here in the United States. Eddie is truly glorious in this San Francisco performance. I do not remember laughing so hard in a standing routine. My wife and I enjoyed this tape and his work at Glorious. I just wish I could buy a copy and help Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more of your available shows.
