This was how black society was before the cracks, the gangsta rap and the AIDS that harassed the ghettos in the eighties. Decent families and workers who struggled to survive and all the traumas and tribulations they faced. Black America was a different group of people in the seventies. Still full of hope and flying high in the civil rights movements of the sixties, times were difficult, but still worth fighting. Keeping his head out of the water, making a wave when he can, this program demonstrated how the black society struggled to work together as individuals and families, before they started attacking each other and everyone else to survive the horrors of the ghettos. It is heartbreaking to see what the black ghettos were like at that time and what they have become now.
