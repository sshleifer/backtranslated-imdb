The film "MacArthur" begins and ends in that of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata, the United States Military Academy of West Point in Hudson. We see a fragile 82. Gen.MacArthur give the graduation speech to the graduating class of 1962 about the honor that is serving his country. Then, the film begins in a flashback of almost two hours on the brilliant and controversial career of General MacArthur that begins in the darkest hours of World War II on the beleaguered island of Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942. < <br /> He was told to leave the island to Australia before the Japanese army invaded him, General MacArthur, for the first time in his military career, almost disobeyed a direct order from his superior statesman. United, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that he would leave his men in their greatest need, MacArthur, reluctantly, along with his wife and young son, did what they told him only to chase him during the reminder of the war. That was the reason, its escape under fire from death or captivity by the Japanese, which led General MacArthur to use all his influence to obtain FDR two years later to launch a major invasion of the Philippians, instead of the island of Formosa, to back its promise to both the Filipino people and the thousands of American POWs left behind. That he will return and return with the power of the US Army and Navy. UU To back your promise! <br /> <br /> In the two years before the invasion of the Philippine Islands, General MacArther struck Japanese forces in the South Pacific in a series of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and starved to hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops in surrender. The general did that and suffered much less American military losses than any other allied commander in the War in the Pacific! <br /> <br /> It was in 1950/51 in the Korean War that General MacArthur achieved his brightest victory and his worst military defeat. After defeating the advance of the North Korean Army in bright and perfectly executed, with the invasion of US Marines. UU Suffering less than 100 casualties, the invasion of the back door or the left hook of the Inchon Gen. MacArther felt invincible and sent to the US forces. UU Border, along the Yalu River, communist red China. When his subordinates told him that he was facing the threat of a massive attack by the Chinese Communist troops, General MacArthur went ahead until the attack materialized, cutting off US forces. UU And the UN. The unstoppable wave after wave of attack of Chinese red troops forced the US forces. UU / United Nations to retire in the "Big Bug Out" of 1950 with their own lives, leaving behind all their equipment, across the border with North Korea, even leaving the capital of South Korea of ​​Seoul! This turned out to be one of the biggest military disasters in the history of EE. UU With the US forces UU Losing a record: in the Korean War, 1,000 lives on the first day of November. 29/30 of 1950: of the Chinese communist invasion! <br /> <br /> Surprised and humiliated for what he allowed, mainly due to his own arrogance, MacArthur went on the offensive not against the advance of Chinese Communism and the North Koreans Forces but his own commander and chief of pres. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, in him, do not have the guts or the guts to do what must be done: launch a large-scale invasion of Communist China with nuclear weapons, if necessary, to prevent its troops invade the Korean Peninsula! For pres. Truman, who had taken almost General MacArthur's garbage in him, ran around in public because of the way he was handling the war doing nothing, as MacArthur wanted him to do, against the red Chinese. This was the last straw! On April 11, 1951 pres. Truman unceremoniously revived General MacArthur from his command as supreme commander of the US forces. UU / UN in Korea. Pres. Truman's brave but very unpopular decision, by not following MacArthur's total war strategy, prevented the Third World War from exploding with the Soviet Union, an ally of communist China, which at that time, like the United States, I had the atomic bomb! Pres. Truman's controversial decision to get rid of the very popular General MacArthur also cost him his re-election in 1952 with his poll numbers so low (in the mid-20s) that he retired in March of that year from the US Presidential Campaign. . UU ! <br /> <br /> In General MacArthur's misfortune to be present when the political and military climates in the world were changing in the way of conducting future wars. With the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a reality would have been a national suicide to do everything possible, as General MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese, with what very possibly would be a nuclear holocaust that would sink. Not only the USSR of the United States and Red China, but the whole world! It was that important reality of the future war that was never taught to General MacArthur, since bombs A and H had not yet been invented, at West Point. <br /> <br /> Back to 1962, we can now see the general. MacArthur, after finishing his graduation speech at West Point, had become an older and wiser soldier and, since his retirement from the US Army. UU., He became an old statesman about the war and its total uselessness. One thing that General MacArthur learned at an early age, from his father Douglas MacArthur Sr, General of the Civil War, who stuck his whole life was that, for a soldier like him, war should be the last and not the first resource to resolve issues between nations. In that it is the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. With the advent of the nuclear age, General MacArthur took a lifetime to realize how wise and wise his father was a winner of the Congress Medal of Honor, like himself.
