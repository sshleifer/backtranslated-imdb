My friend had the idea to see the animated LOTR after seeing the return of Peter Jackson from The King. So I finally bought it out of e-bay, thinking from the start that it was going to stink. Actually, it really was not as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for its time, they used a unique method to mix the live action with the animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who made the voice of Frodo sounded like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> Not the best adaptation of a book, but trust me, I have seen much worse. It skips a lot, since both Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed into a two-hour movie. Definitely worth seeing, children may like it, but still, without any comparison with the Peter Jackson trilogy.
