I recently saw this 1954 film starring Vincent Price for the first time in Turner Classic Movies. Price plays Don Gallico, a magician / inventor who is forced to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, played in a brief role by the charming Eva Gabor). Even though Price is a murderer, I really regretted him, he is a nice character who becomes crazy because of the greedy people around him who continue to take advantage of him. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not. It has the "horror" factor of some of its most famous roles (like my favorite, "House of Wax"), but it still has enough to keep viewers interested. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of Vincent Price.
