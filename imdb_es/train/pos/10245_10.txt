This was one of my personal favorites when I was young, I had everything that was great with movies for children of the 90s ... adorable dinosaurs, adorable children, an eccentric villain and some great songs (and not the typical little mermaid / beauty and The songs of beast type, but those that are entertaining at the same time)! I came across this movie again recently and I still love her as much as ever. I recommend that all people of all ages watch this movie, and I definitely think it should be presented to the younger generations! I'm sorry, it's not the most informative, I'm a bit rushed ... just please, trust me. Everyone who goes against this movie is killing their inner child!
