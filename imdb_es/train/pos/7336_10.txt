This is another of Ralph Bakshi's fantasy favorites; After watching it on YouTube, that's it. Set in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric search for sword and witchcraft between good and evil. Nekron, the lord of the ice kingdom and his mother, Queen Juliana, has set his sights on the conquest of the known world. When his glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) swears to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile, the subhuman subordinates of Nekron and Juliana capture Princess Teegra, the sensual daughter of King Jarol of Firekeepers; but manages to escape, and finally meets Larn, who promises to accompany her back to Firekeep; if the subhumans do not find them first. <br /> <br /> This movie made very little box office (like most of Ralph Bakshi's films), but it has become a cult classic, partly because of the quality of the art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. Also, I heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who had made Conan comic stories, and the background painters included James Gurney, the illustrator of Dinotopia's novels; although the truth is that I had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade, known for his works of art for figurines, music boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company as well as paintings. And like Bakshi's films, The Lord of the Rings and American pop, this movie was rotoscopied, but the process works better in this film than in the previous one. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it is one of the best animated. fantasy movies never made, and an impressive collaboration between two great minds: Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With lots of fantasy, sexual innuendos and exciting adventure.
