This movie is just great. It's entertaining from start to finish, you'll always be on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In my opinion, this film is very undervalued by critics. <br /> <br /> Sly fits perfectly into the role of the well-trained mountain rescue guy Gabe Walker. Along with him, Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen of him as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the movie takes place on a mountain with a lot of bad guys. It opens the way for a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie!
