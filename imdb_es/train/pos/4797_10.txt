I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film, Lynch showed critics that he has the talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside the surreal aura for which he is known in the last decade. As much as the film is G-rated, it's pure Lynch in style, rhythm and tone. The film moves at a magically hypnotic pace and is full of scenes of real emotion and power. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is fantastic, as can be expected from a Lynch movie, and the transition montage sequences are impressive. It is also very refreshing to see a movie in which the characters are all kind, good-hearted and not unmotivated that are clearly labeled as "good" or "evil". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth becomes a beautiful performer like the rest of the cast, especially Sissy Spacek in a endearing performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role. <br /> <br /> With this film, David Lynch proved critical. that he could make a powerful moving image like he did in the '80s with' Blue Velvet 'and' The Elephant Man '. Critics seemed to lose faith in the last decade after he produced surrealistic films like 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' and 'Lost Highway', but with this film he showed that there was a method for FWWM and LH, and it seems that the critics finally achieved their recent film 'Mulholland Drive', considering the great praise he has received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> 'Straight Story' is for me one of the most moving films I've seen. I have ever seen It is a loving story about the family, friendship and kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it
