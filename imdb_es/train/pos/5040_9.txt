The first time I saw Frailty's trailer on Yahoo Movies was in the past, after listening to Stephen King praise him to heaven. I was not really a fan of any of the stars, I still wanted to see it because I'm a big fan of thrillers. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The performance was excellent, especially by the two young people. In general, I hate children's actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did a good job directing him too. It was beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The twists of the plot should also be taken into account. The three turns at the end hit hard and fast, and I did not see them coming. The final turn of the film, along with the seriousness of what had just been revealed, gives me chills to this day, even though I've seen the film so many times. <br /> <br /> A real gem.
