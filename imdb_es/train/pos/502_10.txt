In the 35 years since TOS premiered, the Star Trek team became an expert in economics. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, they decided, quite rightly in my opinion, to abandon the aspect of TOS and the reverse engineering of TNG and others. everyone. So what would happen if they decided not to make the protractor come out of the golden glow or make the phase guns look closer to those of Star Trek II? As for the nits that were chosen on the first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was assumed, based on the comments made by Kirk and Riker, that Earth only met the Klingons in 2200. Nothing was firmly established. <br /> <br /> Enterprise gives us the most promising exploration site we've seen in a long time. This is what Voyager could have been. No series can evolve without some inconsistencies, but it appreciates that Star Trek has so few. So, stop grabbing and enjoy.
