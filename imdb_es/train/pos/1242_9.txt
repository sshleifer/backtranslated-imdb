['I love this movie. He is well written and acted and has good cinematography. The story combines action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with great settings and beautiful location shots. See it, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /><br /> The acting is good and Murphy, especially, does a good job of portraying the reluctant / unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions. <br /><br /> I did not care what happened to these people and, although the result was quite predictable (the good guys win, the hero gets the girl surprisingly attractive and the holy boy saves lives, who does not see that coming?), He still made me Happy when everything went well in the end. Thank God, the dignity of this movie was never ruined with a shitty sequel. Grab some popcorn, curl up on the couch and watch this fun, happy and entertaining movie.']
