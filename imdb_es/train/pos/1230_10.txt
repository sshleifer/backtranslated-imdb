After watching this movie for the third time, I think it's almost Adam's worst movie. PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR compared to this. I must say that in the end, when Dickie pulls out of the boat, it's so funny (the hair is different from yours) and I like it when he gets mad at everyone.This movie should only be brought if you're a true Adam Sandler fan. /> <br /> The characters are poor compared to their fun films like Waterboy, which has the same people in it (Peter Dante), who is one of the assassins who try to kill the Australian bird. <br /> < This film lacks depth and a decent story and deserves to be among the last 100
