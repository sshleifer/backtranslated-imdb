One of the best Tarzan films is also one of its most action-packed (and graphic). <br /> <br /> Picking up a year or more after Tarzan the ape man, Holt by Niel Hamilton has asked a rich friend to fund a Safari back to the elephant cemetery to pick up ivory. His friend also arrives with dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to retrieve Jane from Tarzan. Before they can leave, Holt finds that his map is stolen and becomes a mad race to try to capture an expedition in competition. When they finally take the thieves, they find the whole party dead and surrounded. They have no choice but to fight to get out and soon discover that they are out of the pan and on fire. Finally, Tarzan and Jane appear and everyone has even more adventures. <br /> <br /> The famous movie was heavily censored to reduce graphic violence (its graphics even by today's standards, you would probably get a PG 13) and to remove all hints of nudity (there is a nude swimming scene several minutes of length that involves Jane, who is completely frontal in her nudity, was only recently restored). It is clear that the restored version is seen why this movie was reduced by 20 minutes in its runtime for TV. As it is in its restored version, this is a very adult film that is romantic, moving, full of action and everything a movie should be. It is an incredible movie by almost any standard. The best thing of all is the type of film that plays well as an independent adventure, one must not have seen the first movie to enjoy it, but it is also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were configured in that original film. . It is an amazing thing. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. <br /> <br /> If there are flaws in the film, it is possible that the film has not aged well. The back screen is often very obvious, there are gorilla suits for many of the monkeys and some of the other effects are more picturesque than compelling. However, on almost every other level, this movie is first class. <br /> <br /> You really owe it to yourself to see this. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and lie down on the couch and let yourself go for a simpler time. This is one of the great adventures.
