Like many Americans, I was introduced to Hayao Miyazaki's works for the first time when I saw "Spirited Away." I fell in love with the movie and I've seen it many times. Now I'm on a quest to see all of Miyazaki's movies. One of his previous works is "Castle in the Sky". Although it's still nice, it's not as good as "Spirited Away" (although it may be unfair to compare this or any movie with its 2002 masterpiece). <br /> <br /> A young man named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is one night, working in a mine, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is involved in an adventure that will take him to danger with the pirates, the army and a lost floating city. <br /> <br /> Going into a Hayao Miyazaki movie means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and wonder like Miyazaki. Watching a Miyazaki movie is like experiencing a fantastic dream since childhood. <br /> <br /> Because the film is animated, bending the film does not represent a big problem because it is almost impossible to determine if the movements of the lips match the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well written and expressed by talented actors. The voice acting is very varied. James Van Der Beek is doing better. It brings an irresistible enthusiasm and enthusiasm for the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is almost as good as Sheeta. She is scared by the events that happen around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska. He is dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is horrible like Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for "The Last Picture Show," but she is as annoying as the pirate leader. Leachman gives the character an unpleasant croak that is almost always monotonous. It's so bad that it almost ruins the movie! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's as evil as the general. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend seeing "Castle in the Sky". I probably end up buying myself. But although it's not as good as "Spirited Away," it's still pretty good.
