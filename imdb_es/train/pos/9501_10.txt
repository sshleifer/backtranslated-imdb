I had seen this movie when it was released, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still remember vividly the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escapes every time he faces danger :) And the best feature of the film was The Portrait of the villain! I think many of the so-called action movies copy many "escape scenes" from this movie! And not only does it not impress me when I see such a copy, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The main actors have performed wonderfully. The slow and realistic development of chemistry between the hero and the heroine was extremely natural and beautifully portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed between them was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even children realize the value of true love, sacrifice And care. I recommend that all people watch this movie when given an opportunity. --Vijay.
