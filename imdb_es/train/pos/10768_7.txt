I saw this years ago when I was younger and I could never remember the title, until one day I was reviewing the credits of the John Candy movie in IMDb and noticed an entry called "Once Upon a Crime ...". Something touched the bell and I pressed it, and after reading the summary of the plot it brought back many memories. <br /> <br /> I discovered that you have aged quite well despite the fact that it is not like that. It means a "great" comedy. However, it's quite nice and it's a good riff in a Hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and emotions around the world. <br /> <br /> The film has a large cast of characters, including an American couple who finds a female dog. While on vacation in Europe, decide to return it to her as a reward, only to find her body upon arrival. From there, the plot becomes increasingly crazy and they go on the run after the police believe they are the killers. <br /> <br /> It's a mix of "It's a Mad Mad Mad World" and a lighter feature of Hitchcock. , this was directed by Eugene Levy and he got some of his good friends, like John Candy, to star in it. The film is especially attractive because of its cast, and the ending has a little funny twist that is not totally unpredictable but it is also something unexpected.
