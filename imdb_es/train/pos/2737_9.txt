The film was exciting from beginning to end and his black and white photography of the American heart is impressive. We feel that we are there with them when they cross the country of the great sky and then they enter Mexico and return to America again. Near the end of the film, the reflection of the rain in Robert Blake seems small rivers of sweat and tears that fall down his face. In the end, we follow them down the stairs until their last moment. <br /> <br /> The two criminals, played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, such as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, could be seen on any street in any city. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in the eyes of the wrong side of the city. This point is mentioned in the film and it always surprises us that criminals are not different in appearance than others. Evil, even the vilest, is part of the human condition. These two delirious men kill a whole family, in search of a safe that is not there. Once in the race, they start issuing checks without funds and a trail is found for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many excellent support actors. I like John Forsyth as the case detective, Alvin Dewey. In addition, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecutor. <br /> <br /> Many times I have wanted to see this movie until the end, I have only captured it in short fragments; I finally got it after buying the DVD. The result is the best classic crime movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this brilliant movie. For me, this is what the big movie is about.
