let me tell you that I love Adam Sandler, while watching the reign over me, I was paying close attention to his performance <br /> <br /> when he raises his voice, I can not help but think of happy Gilmore yelling at a golf ball, then I answer while Adam Sandler sucks me <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a movie that comes out slowly at the beginning, expecting emotion in every scene <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always makes a great I work and it is not an exception here with some truly great lines and it is worthy of an Oscar in any movie that makes it. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler was amazing in many ways, not only was this the most dramatic / The best movie of his career. but I can remember laughing out loud in many parts of this movie. <br /> <br /> The cast was also great with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie. tremendous beautiful scenes from the great New York comedy, great drama and a new respect for Adam Sandler if he ever doubted him or a guarantee of how great Don Cheadle is.
