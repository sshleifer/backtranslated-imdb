['I&#39;ve never seen four hours go by as fast as when I saw this movie. This film gives back to Hamlet the power and the art that always should have. Even such famous discourses are done in new and inventive ways. And the cast is amazing, Brannagh the brightest star. It is his charisma, power and mastery of the role that defines the film. Making it a complete and complete version fills so many holes and allows a new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length. Where one would expect the dark and gloomy clich√© castle, we invite ourselves to a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The only pessimism comes from Hamlet himself, as it should be. Well worth your time, all four hours of it.']
