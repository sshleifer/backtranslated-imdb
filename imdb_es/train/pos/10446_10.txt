I saw this movie 10 years ago. and I have seen it on video an average of once a year since then. It's the kind of movie that is timeless, because the themes are universal, but the stories and the conversation are very personal. It is also one of the few films that capture him from frame one to the credits roll, despite the fact that, in reality, there are only two (very enveloping) characters. this is due in large part to the attractive performance of hawke and delpy, which make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. This is also the first movie I saw that mentioned reality TV, and now, the phenomenon is very widespread! I love the way this film envelops the audience in your space, and it makes you think, no matter how tired you are, that you are one of those characters. It also made me want to travel by train in Europe! I have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. Maybe that speaks of me, my friends or just the genius of this movie.
