I picked up this title by accident with the Grindhouse vol. 1 collection of pure European garbage films. But this movie has a nice seal of approval and should merit a better transfer than is available. Stupednous is not ... satisfy is! Watching this movie I could not help but wonder ... why did not Sergio Martino make this movie? This has his signature everywhere and is scored by Edwedge Fenech (unfortunately not as well known as it should be, but he got a good cameo in Hostel II). Double crosses and crosses crossed below and cement this film from start to finish with Lee Van Cleef oozing coldness under pressure from the first second. Did he have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential or did the study system let it slip? In addition to Lee's most recognizable films, moviegoers should try it out for size and see if Sergio Leone had dropped his epic scale on Once Upon a Time in America at half-time (and 1/4 of the budget). It is what it would have turned out to be. So refreshing, it should be taken during the day at home and prepared for a sofa bed.
