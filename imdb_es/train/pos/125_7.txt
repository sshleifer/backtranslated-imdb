Lars Von Trier is never behind in trying new techniques. Some of them are very original, while others forget better. <br /> <br /> Represents post-war Germany as a nightmarish train ride. With so many cities in ruins, Leo Kessler, a young American of German descent, feels obliged to help in its restoration. It is not a simple task, since you quickly realize it. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds him a job as a night driver on the Zentropa railway line. Your job is to meet the needs of passengers. When shoes are polished, a chalk mark is made on the plants. There is a terrible argument when a passenger's shoes are not marked with chalk despite the fact that they have been polished. There are many allusions to German fanaticism to cling to such stupid details. <br /> <br /> The journey by rail is like an allegory that represents the procession of man through life with all its trials and tribulations. In a sequence, Leo runs through the back carriages to discover them full of half-starved bodies that seem to have escaped from Auschwitz. These images, as horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible impact but without connection. <br /> <br /> At a station called Urmitz, Leo jumps off the train with a bomb in packages. In view of many bystanders, connect the pump to the bottom of a car. He returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock. Later, he jumps off the train (at high speed) and lays on fresh grass on the bank of a river. Looking at the stars above, he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. Later, when he sees the train approaching a giant bridge, it runs at a dizzying speed to board the train and stop the clock. If you are interested in analyzing the situation, it is a completely impossible task. Quite ridiculous indeed. It could only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It is strange how one remembers small details like a row of cups hanging from hooks and rattling with the rolling train. <br /> <br /> Although this film is widely acclaimed, I prefer the later films of Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The scene of the bomb described above really discouraged me. Maybe I'm realistic.
