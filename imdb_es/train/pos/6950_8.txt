On the day of the California presidential primary, between midnight and 1:00 a.m., spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the US. UU Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer returned with his family and is having problems at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, who blames her mother Teri for getting Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim, and discover that the girl has run away from home. While trying to solve his domestic problem, Jack is called to his Anti-Terrorist Unit by his colleague Nina Myers for a meeting with his boss Richard Walsh, who reveals a threat to the life of Senator David Palmer, who is running for president, and I need to find the shooter. Later, Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and tells him that there is a conspiracy in the agency against David Palmer, and assigns Jack to look for the conspirators. When an airplane explodes in the Mojave Desert, Jack has an additional problem to worry about. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a promising start to a successful series, featuring Jack Bauer. This is the first time I see this program and I confess that I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a reliable agent in charge of three difficult missions at the same time: find a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in your agency; and he finds his teenage daughter, who is getting into trouble, while trying to save her marriage. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
