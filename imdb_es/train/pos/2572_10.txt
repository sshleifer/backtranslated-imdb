I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies, so combined they were twice as good. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable. They are a great team. The only drawback is that I really did not understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before this movie, but how? If they said it, I should have lost it. Apart from that I give two thumbs up! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have had a lot of training. They were so funny and all the noises that Jerry Lee would make when Dooley was talking to him was so much fun. My favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he bit the private people for very, very funny information.
