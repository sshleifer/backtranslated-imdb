1939 is universally accepted as the best year in the history of Hollywood, with more classic films released than any other, and John Ford directed three of the best, "Stagecoach", "Drums Along the Mohawk", and this beautiful tribute to days border and a young lawyer from the area destined to save the Union, "Young Mr. Lincoln". <br /> <br /> With the world mired in a war that the United States feared, but I knew it would be involved, Abraham Lincoln was very involved. The mind of the people, in 1939, as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life and had triumphed. On Broadway, the award-winning "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" by Robert E. Sherwood, with the physically dead representation of Raymond Massey, was playing in full houses (filmed in 1940). The continuation of Carl Sandburg's epic biography, "Abraham Lincoln: The War Years," was published and quickly became a bestseller. President Roosevelt frequently referred to Lincoln in his speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, DC, became the most popular landmark in the city (a fact that Frank Capra made good use of, in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington "). /> <br /> All this was not lost in Darryl F. Zanuck, in 20th Century Fox; as soon as he read Lamar Trotti's script of Lincoln's early days as a lawyer, he designated it as a 'prestige' production, and assigned John Ford to direct, and Henry Fonda, the star. <br /> <br /> Fonda I do not want to play Lincoln; he felt that he could not do justice to the "Great Emancipator," and he feared that a bad performance would hurt his career. Even a filmed makeup test, in which he was surprised at how much he would look like Lincoln, would not change his mind. According to Fonda, John Ford, with whom he had never worked, cursed him at their first meeting, explaining that he was not introducing the Lincoln of Legend, but a young "jackanape" lawyer facing his first murder trial. . Humble, Fonda took the paper. (John Ford offered a different scenario for the events, but the result was the same!) Obviously, they found a joint chemistry that worked, since almost all of their peers would produce "classics." <br /> <br /> Unlike the introverted and melancholy Lincoln of "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", Ford's vision was that of a shy but nice young lawyer, who easily became friends and misses the mother who lost , too young (which resulted in a bond with a pioneer mother who becomes a vital part of the story). Injustice irritates him, and he speaks "common sense" to stifle violence, intertwined with a dose of humor. Both productions play in the relationship of Lincoln (undocumented) with Ann Rutledge; In the Ford version, the couple is truly in love and committed to each other. After his death, Lincoln often visited his grave to share his life with his "spirit" (a theme that Ford would continue in "She wore a yellow ribbon"). <br /> <br /> A murder trial is the centerpiece of the film, and it shows the prodigious talents of the star and the director. Fonda deftly portrays Lincoln's inexperience, but his fervent belief in justice is sympathetic to mercy, and Ford emphasizes the gap between the "intellectuals" of the big city (represented by the pompous DA Donald Meek, and his witty "advisor" , Stephen Douglas, played by a young Milburn Stone), and the informal and informal sense of Lincoln. With Ford's 'Bond' Bond as a key witness, the trial is unconventional and fascinating. <br /> <br /> With the film closing when Lincoln moves away in the stormy distance and his fate (dissolves in a view of the statue in the Lincoln Memorial), the public could be comfortable with the message of the movie that if the cause is just, the good would eventually triumph. <br /> <br /> "Young Mr. Lincoln" is a truly remarkable film, from Â¡An amazing year!
