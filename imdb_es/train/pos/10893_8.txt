It is good that you have rented the movie before seeing the audience rate of this site. It was a wonderful movie that I will add to my Christmas selection. The cast was chosen beautifully and Ben Affleck has a good leadership role. I would tell viewers that they have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it. I rate it with the Christmas holidays. The film was very funny and well written, and Ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well. What he says and does is how I imagine a person with too much money to act. The movie is much more fun than Santa Claus and Christmas With The Kranks. In addition, it has a good history and teaches the true meaning of Christmas, which is that you can not buy love with money.
