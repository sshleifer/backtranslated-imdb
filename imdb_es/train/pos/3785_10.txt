This movie is very underestimated. He is highly imaginative, creative and intelligent. It's just fun and, in my opinion, this movie heads the first. But the film was forgotten when it first came out, and was overlooked even more as the years passed. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombed at the box office, while the first was a pretty good and very popular success. <br /> <br /> I think the problem may be that this movie premiered a couple of years too late. In 1991, Bill and Ted already seemed "so '80s." Even though the 80s were only a couple of years ago, the panorama of music and style for children had changed so radically with gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and the sound of Seattle. Bill and Ted with their music Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses along with their 80s style seemed to be so out of place and very outdated in '91, and I think that's a BIG reason why the movie was bombed at the box office. Nobody, except surfers, kept saying things like "excellent!" and "false!" in 1991. "Gremlins 2", which also came out in the early 90s, suffered the same fate of being a good movie that bombed at the box office because it was associated with the 80s. The transition from the 80s to the 90s was a change much faster than now with the 90s and 00s. 1991 had nothing to do with 1988 or 1989, while at this time, 2002 and last year, 2001 is still seen as 1995 or 1996. <br /> < If only "Excellent Adventure" was released, which was made in 1988, ESE YEAR instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was done quickly and launched in 1989, it probably would have been as wildly received as the first.
