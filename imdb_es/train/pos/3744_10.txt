This is possibly the best short crime drama I've seen. The acting is excellent, especially Amanda Burton, whose character goes from fear of the sweet to the disturbing to the sad and then to ... She does an incredible job balancing the feelings of Rachels / Carlas and representing the pain of someone who has lost a son, it's so believable that it feels more like a real-life story than a drama. Of course, the other actors are also great, which is usually in British television / cinema. The ending, which I will not reveal, is fantastic, mainly because you do not get one ... (you'll get what I want to say after having seen it) It's worth buying it and seeing it. again and again, and if it does not move you, you are a cold-hearted person.
