This is one of those movies in which you find yourself when you navigate through a channel on Saturday afternoons, you get into them and end up seeing everything. I thought she was well acted and she really made me feel for the characters. Although it is a little slow, focusing more on the relationships between Bonnie and Clyde and their relatives, he never got bored. We do not really see too much of all the robberies for which they were so legendary, and instead most of the shootings occur when they are ambushed by the police. I thought that Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really did a good job with her character. Going from a good country girl to a murderer in cold blood is difficult to portray, and I enjoyed the subtlety that she brought to the role. Made for the television movie.
