I only saw the first part of this series when it debuted in the late 90's and recently I had the opportunity to see the three parts through Netflix (convenient service by the way). In general, I liked this cheerful mini series, sometimes challenged by the genre. The story of a younger man in love with an older woman seems to work and all the actors are fine. Yes, it has some romantic clich√©s of running in the rain or a farewell train station, but the characters have the opportunity to be explored by what does not seem corny, as if it were a Tom Hanks vehicle or similar. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of a separate Scott Bakula at birth, does an excellent job of someone who is madly in love and the tide and ebb of desire and rejection make the series a worthy option to watch. Personally, I think the series could have been done with two episodes, but I guess that's a matter of debate. Apparently, there is a sequel, and that should arrive tomorrow through Netflix.
