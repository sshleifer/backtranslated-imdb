Once again, this movie is not perfect. It does not "hang up", since the story is basically a bunch of hooks to hang jokes on. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a bit 'too 80' and tend to date the image. <Br /> <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know that a movie has something special when you and your friends still refer to silly quotes more than 2 decades later. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a lot of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the last papers of Alan Hale Jr., the Gilligan Island Patron. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some great absurd moments, like when Johnny is labeling the puppies with a price gun, or when the Pope makes an appearance in Johnny's neighborhood. In addition, the scene in which the false priest invents many words in Latin is excellent. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio is too louda ... Post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian"). <br /> <br /> Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney killing the English language Danny Devito urging Griffin Dunne told Peter Boyle that 'Play Ball' lost his manhood The fake VD movie <br /> <br / > This movie is not a home run. But like 'Porky's', it has enough bits of classic comedy to make it memorable.
