The most accessible film of John Waters to date is one of his best films, considering that it reduces all the chaos and absolute vulgarity that seem to foul most of his previous work. Of course, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it is presented in a way that can not be considered too disgusting or disgusting. Due to some excellent casting options, this film really brought out the nonsense associated with modern art and the subjective nature of its modern artist. Fun and somewhat cheerful (if possible for Waters), this is one of those movies you would see on a rainy day.
