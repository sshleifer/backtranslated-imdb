In any number of movies, you can find Nicholas Cage as a strong and silent hero, Dennis Hopper as a homicidal maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vampire / vagabond, and the late J.T. Walsh like the heavy one. These are the types of roles that these four can play while they sleep, and they have done so often that watching them play again skirts the cliché. What a relief, therefore, that John Dahl, a master at getting a lot of humor out of a small action, directed this black-haired thriller. Hopper manages to avoid going over, Cage shows a little more depth than his generally superficial action heroes, Boyle becomes sensual, innocent and intriguing, and one has an idea of ​​the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character Wayne Dahl's address gives an idea of ​​the vacuum of the country of Big Sky, where the story unfolds, and at the same time is intimate enough to show how a wrinkled forehead can indicate a radical change of plot in the store. The twists of the plot are first rate, and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the secondary characters act as if they had brains. It is not often that minor characters, such as deputy sheriffs, have more intelligence than their superior superiors. But with a director as smart as Dahl, you should not be surprised by the intelligence of anything related to this film. An excellent movie
