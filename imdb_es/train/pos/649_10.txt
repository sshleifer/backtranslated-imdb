We do not have to miss this movie, this is one of the best I've seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the film is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle fashion. Jean Eustache is no longer on this earth, we only have black and white images to remember one of the largest and most undervalued French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I will never forget. <br /> <br /> P.S.: sorry for the English ...
