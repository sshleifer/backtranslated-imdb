For me too, this Christmas special is one that I remember with great affection. In 1989, I grabbed the 2 CDs that I found from the recording of the soundtrack, delivering one to my sister and keeping the other one for myself. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now, and I'd love to see the show again instead of just remembering it while listening. <br /> <br /> It has been observed elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances on the Muppet Show, and they made more than one special together. The good relationship between Denver and its diffuse companions is clearly manifested here, in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages.
