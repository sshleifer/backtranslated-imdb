All the talent that Mr. Sooraj Barjatya showed in his first 3 movies, I thought they were all an accident because his 4th. Main premiere was ki diwani hoon. But I have to say it was not an accident. This guy is talented and the way Vivah has done it is just brilliant. From the first scene it affects you. The sequences between shahid and amrita are impressive. The chemistry between these two actors gives a glimpse of that between srk and kajol. As usual, Alok Nath as the good and loving father is fantastic, so is Anupam Kher. But it's a Shahid-Amrita movie. Amrita looks good in most scenes, although Shahid seems a bit young to get married, but she does a good job of a shy but morally strong boyfriend. This film will be especially appreciated by those who have gone through such beautiful moments in their lives. In short, a brilliant movie. Congratulations to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
