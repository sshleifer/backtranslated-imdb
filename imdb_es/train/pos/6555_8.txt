I've read over 100 of Nancy Drew's books, and if you're still not smart enough to understand, Nancy Drew the movie was of a YOUNG Nancy Drew, not the 18-year-old who does not attend school. Of the books are treated. This was when she was sixteen. So, naturally, she would not have been as smart as the book considering that she's only in the tenth grade. Apart from that, I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and appropriate for everyone. It was fun sometimes. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. It was articulate, in character, and cute. I liked the discomfort that Nancy and Ned had with each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like the one they have in the books. It was a nice PG movie that I enjoyed a lot because, unlike most people of my age, I enjoy movies without sex, drugs or blasphemies.
