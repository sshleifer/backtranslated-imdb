What a lovely television movie that warms your heart. The story tells of a little five-year-old girl who has lost her father and finds it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very distressed ... only a miracle can alleviate her unhappiness. What all the spectators expect to materialize. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the mother of the girl, since she was like the nanny in "Jack and Sarah", it is worth seeing if you like Samantha Mathis as much as happy; Year tear jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a lovely grandmother in this tender and superbly acted movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little girl of five years old) is charming and a very convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so moving. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human kindness that is clearly illustrated and clearly is still around us in this difficult world in which we live. "Mermaid" gives us We all hope, realizing that there are many lovely people in the world with a lot of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
