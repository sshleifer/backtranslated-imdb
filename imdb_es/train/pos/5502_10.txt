Whether this film is propaganda or not (I firmly believe that it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good Chávez is as a man. It really is to demonstrate the way the Bolivarians saw how it happened, the way Chávez sees it. Although it seems wrong and partial to support a film, I think the point of view shown in the film is absolutely legitimate. The Venezuelan people through the private media corporation of Venezuela only saw a perspective of the coup d'état, the neoliberal side. This movie shows us how the Bolivarians saw it. Call it propaganda, I say it is a judgment on your part.
