This has been, by far, one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I have seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man that is in extinction. He sees the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it is primitive in a good way. His purity, honesty and kindness breathe clearly as you watch him work on momentary works of art that are so simplistic but full of life. I was surprised by the patience with which he created his pieces and the patience with which he accepted his end. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish sense of humor brilliantly covers his disappointments. The film was filmed with elegance and contains the same flow as Goldsworthy's art. It combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself. Fred Frith's score is organic enough to combine everything without interfering with his naturalistic sound. This is generally a great job in all aspects. It has no limits in terms of age.
