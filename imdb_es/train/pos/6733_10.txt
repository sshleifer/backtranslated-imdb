['There has been a series of recent surf movies that I think I ran at random without warning. I captured this treasure on a digital cable this week and it was a pleasant surprise! The focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60s Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks and Jaws. Hell, I could watch a movie about Laird Hamilton, one of the great athletes of this generation, so the rest is just a sauce. There is a lot of good surf mixed with interviews of surf stars past and present, in a pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious way. Of all the surf movies I&#39;ve seen, this is the best of the big waves, and I think it&#39;s my favorite. Enjoy!']
