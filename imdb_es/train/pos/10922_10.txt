When I was very young, at a local television station, they showed kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays. I saw many Kung Fu movies on weekends. I remember many of them. I saw great movies like Crippled Masters, Blind Fist of Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, Rage of the Master, Tattoe Dragon, and ... Five Deadly Poisons. I remember the day clearly. My father and I had just had lunch at Burger King. look at what movie would be this Saturday. We ran to the house and jumped to the sofa, turned on the set and placed it on 56. The usual introduction of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu on Saturday. . Then, below that was the title of the movie. Said Five Deadly Venoms. Then the movie started. I bit into my burger with the pre-credit sequence. I loved this movie at the time it was produced. My favorite character was the Toad Venom. The plan was difficult to follow at that age, but that was not what attracted me ... it was the fight. The fights were so ... amazing. G. I complained every time a commercial came out and soon after 2 hours of the best movie I had ever seen.
