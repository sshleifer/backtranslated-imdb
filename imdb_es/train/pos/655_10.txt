['Unfortunately, Jean Eustache (1938-1981) belongs to many of the most important French filmmakers today to the great strangers whose films are hard to find and are not released on international DVDs. As we have a good old-fashioned video store in Tucson, I had the opportunity to see this 3 1/2 hour marathon masterpiece that is not boring in ten seconds. <br /><br /> As we talk here about one of the most discussed (and most controversially discussed) films of all time, let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogues, originally typical of the first &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; by Jacques Rivette or Alain Resnais, appear almost Ridiculous in this movie. The dialogues are basically monologues, mainly the longest spoken by Jean-Pierre Léaud. The most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people are almost nil. Léaud, or his character, Alexandre, is pleased to tell more about himself than about the topics he seems to be talking about. Therefore, you can hardly talk about communication in this movie. It is quite possible that the director had in mind a gigantic satire against the idle functioning of the political and sociological ideas that were once so hot, but the kind of man that Alexandre exists at all times, we found in the &quot;Satiricon&quot; de Petron, that The work bears a strong resemblance to &quot;La madre y la puta&quot;. <br /><br /> Alexandre not only does nothing, but has developed a kind of metaphysics of his own about the absence of action, at least acting in the sense of responsibility towards the society of which he is a part. She makes fun of the people who run to work at 7 in the morning, when she is busy taking her last drink before going to bed in the apartment of one of her friends whose money she lives on. He can not utter a single sentence without citing one of the leading thinkers between Nietzsche and Bernanos. Especially Sartre, who is quickly shown in the French intellectual cafe &quot;Aux Deux Magots&quot;, where Alexandre is also sitting all day, should serve as an excuse for the lifestyle of Alexandre and his colleagues, because they suffer an existential crisis of bourgeois nausea . . However, Alexandre&#39;s intellectual discourses seem to be rather pseudo-intellectual, and the sentences and occurrences he cites come from a dictionary of quotations rather than from his actual reading of the respective books. <br /><br /> It is true: this film requires an extremely broad European knowledge, especially knowledge of French existentialist philosophy and its consequences for the movement of the student revolution 68, but if you have this knowledge, you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life when observing astonished. and the crying laughing as if you had not done it for a long time.']
