This is a charming tale of obsession driven by guilt. <br /> <br /> Matiss, on a lonely night walk in Riga (?) Passes by a woman on the wrong side of the bridge railing. He passes without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help makes it act. And then, too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film recounts his efforts to discover more about women. In a troll of local bars, find your pocket. He gathers more and more parts of his life. His "look" changes as his obsession grows. He has to do things well. In a wonderfully filmed dialogue with the "bastard ex-boyfriend", Alexej is forced to face the guilt they both feel. <br /> <br /> Exciting long shots, a rough soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, barking at the dogs. Steps Charming black cinema with a charming touch. A good indie ending.
