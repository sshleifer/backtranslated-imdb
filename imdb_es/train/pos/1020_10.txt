"Stargate SG-1" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team called SG-1 through a device called Stargate and all the surprises that await on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> Having seen this series sporadically for the first few seasons when it came out, I did not know how good this series would be, 10 years after watching an episode for the last time. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than a simple science fiction series, it is one of the best produced, interesting, long-lasting and most exciting science fiction films ever produced. And because? Because it is based on an incredible premise. <br /> <br /> This value of the series far exceeds that of the film on which it was based and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, has a suitable premise, It is capable of providing Something that does not work in the time constraint of the movie. The feeling of familiarity created by a long-running series, seeing the characters and their circumstances progressing over time is amazing and adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and everything is the result of excellent writing and a lot of dedication on the part of of the whole team. The show. "Stargate SG-1" continued to offer great adventures throughout the 10 years, but never feared the challenge of moving the plot and gave way to different periods of time of the show. : <br /> <br /> - The first seasons, perhaps until the 4th / 5th, focused much more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the Always imminent threat of Goaul. <br /> <br /> - From 5 to 7 there were more and more episodes focused on fighting the Goaul'd and preventing attacks on Earth. After these seasons, the exploration of the planets was almost an excuse to place sg-1 in a place of conflict Goaul'd / replicador / ori <br /> <br /> - The eighth season is probably the most mixed. It has a series of episodes that include minor matters of the Earth in which the star portal is hardly mentioned, but the last episodes present some moments of great replication. <br /> <br /> - The 9 and 10 travel together because they have the same new enemy and not Jack O'Neil. Both are good continuations, although the first episodes of the tenth season are a bit weak, since they seem to be little more than SG-1 and humans / Jaffa losing battle after battle against the Ori. <br /> <br /> Basically, after season 7, the exploration went into the background, which in many ways was a shame, due to the potential and the mystery that each planet presented (episode); on the other hand, he made so many great episodes of ongoing conflicts that the change in the nature of the show still worked and shows how great and audacious the writers were. <br /> <br /> Even the series I think I have a high quality finish that well puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that I could continue; The people involved were all great professionals and the narrative series had a lot to offer. A final season that returned to the initial nature of the series was very feasible and would have been very welcome, but ultimately things are as they are. <br /> <br /> In the end, due to the fact that I enjoyed everything, it's a little hard to find it to end. The general panorama, however, drawn by the work of hundreds of people over 10 years, is a spectacle of beauty and a true testimony of the dedication of the crew, the outstanding actors and the characters that we will always remember. as a collective by the name of SG-1.
