The funniest and funniest Brooks movie I've ever seen. I can see and watch the tape again 100 times. I laugh at my part and I cry at times. It's a really good and funny movie, and if you like Brooks, this is a must see. In short, Brooks (trillions of dollars) goes homeless for 30 days to win over his competitor's poor district. Reality bites, but in the end, it's about warm relationships between humans ... Highly recommended!
