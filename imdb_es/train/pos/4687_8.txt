Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes is an important film, which deals with the dark side of female sexuality (and includes frontal female nudity, which surpasses male nudity). He flirts with sadomasochism and captive falling in love with the theory of the captor. <br /> <br /> This treatment of the female libido is sometimes superficial and uneven, but Borden has traveled far beyond the feminist dogma of women gaining power through her insatiable lust. <br /> <br /> A striking scene exposes the female fetish of horses, when the antagonist, a fake fashion photographer, is seducing an older woman in trousers, by asking her to show her how she rode a horse. He pushes a whip between his legs, pressing it against his crotch, and this greatly increases his excitement. <br /> <br /> Then, suddenly, she leaves her house and she swore abjectly at the closed door. <br /> <Patrick Bergin plays the swindler, and although he is far from handsome, he chooses Janes and has enough presence on the screen to make people believe that women can swallow his line. According to all reports, Sean Young proves to be a rare person, and she is just beautiful. However, in this film as a district attorney, her intense face, slim body and long limbs and accentuated hips and periodically disconnected movements become erotic fascination. His performance is forceful and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden has an intriguing worldview, and the fact that he is so at odds with the modern irresponsible zeitgeist that I really appreciate him.
