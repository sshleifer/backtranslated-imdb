The second of the series Why We Fight focuses on Hitler's hoarding of Sudetanland and beyond, as he makes a chump of Neville Chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of Europe. <br /> <br /> Clearly understood as propaganda in its day, this series on the test of time has become an informative documentary, and most of the "allied bias" has become a historical fact. The FÃ¼hrer stands on his own firecracker with cocky statements to his people and the world while saying one thing and doing another while his army moves eastward. The Czechs and Austrians quickly surrendered, but the Poles put a heroic struggle against the overwhelming difficulties. <br /> <br /> The disparity between the military power of Hitler and Chamberlain waving the Munich treaty like a white flag, declaring that "peace in our time" to this day has lasting propaganda qualities. Here, in its original context, it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of World War II sets in Europe leaving the American viewer with two options, freedom or slavery. In 1943 this simple truth could not be evaded and The Nazis Strike effectively makes its point.
