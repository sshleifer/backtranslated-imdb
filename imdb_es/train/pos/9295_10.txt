It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments regarding this star movie. I laughed through the whole picture, as did my whole family. The movie was clearly defined as a comedy gangster of yesteryear, the players were hysterical, I bet they had a good time while they did. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great, and what about those Everly sisters, each of Falco's two and divine music. Rob Reiner made a great limousine driver laughing, and Gabriel Byrne a laughable neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the character of Sleepy Joe and all the references of the funeral home and the tomb excavator. Paul Anka was his usual entertaining entertainment, with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to make a "My Way" duo welcome to Vick's presentation. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a comic tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated it well. I also think that nobody, of any age, would even think about imitating the actions that happened in this movie, it's a joke, not a terrifying "gangsta" movie. The cars and clothes were impressive, as was the decor, "Vic's Place". <br /> <br /> In truth, I think of "Mad Dog Time" as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, television crime dramas, and talk shows. I would recommend the video for a night of family entertainment.
