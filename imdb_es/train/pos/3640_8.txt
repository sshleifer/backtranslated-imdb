This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid is moving and convincing of the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm surrendered. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he will try for a baseball team if they do. They win (partly because of all the batting practice they do with a coach who can throw more than 90 miles per hour), and he keeps his side of the deal, and it's signed! <br /> <br /> If you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult, the story of Jim Morris will resonate with you. It is moving and inspiring, and man's relationships seem to be true. <br /> <br /> However, inspiration is not the only reason why I rented it. Dennis Quaid is downright pure in this part, and a baseball movie with a handsome man who changes a diaper is my idea of ​​heaven. Ladies, if you feel like me, check this.
