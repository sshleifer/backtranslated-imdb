An absolutely brilliant show. The second season began where the first season ended, with much mystery. The suspense in most, if not all episodes and mystery everywhere. One that made me think and think again. It's really amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters and combine all these elements to make the life of the characters in the show so meaningful. Never stop getting excited and I'm looking forward to the new season. We hope that more secrets will be revealed and, at the same time, more mysteries to be solved. Good selection of cast also for this show, perfectly fits the characters. I really can not wait to finally discover the secret. Let's hope that all the hype does not ruin the end.
