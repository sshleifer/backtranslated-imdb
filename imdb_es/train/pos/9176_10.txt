This revision comes almost 30 years late. However, it should be mentioned that I came across a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and saw it repeatedly for 4 months in a row. I just had to write about that! I fell in love and forgot that there was something else once I saw this movie. How ironic it is to see the ugliest male protagonist in literature played by the most handsome man! However, what a welcome irony! I felt perfectly well and more because Timothy Dalton did full justice to his role. He gave an amazing and triumphant performance! I've never seen anything like it! All the other actors are very good too. The whole movie was set very well. I do not care what they say about this movie. I just love him and I love him! It made me happy and satisfied. It crushes me a bit to say this, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to P & J of A & E, which I think is the definitive miniseries. <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre's excerpts scared me a little at school. I never got to read the book seriously, knowing the story so well. Seeing this particular production made history come to life for me and took me to a close frenzy. The scenes and the voice of Mr. Dalton persecuted me without stopping and finally they took me to read the book seriously, which, of course, is a masterpiece. Bravo to all the team and especially Mr.Dalton! This movie is now part of me. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10 rating.
