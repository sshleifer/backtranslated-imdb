Teen Eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated because of his obsession with heavy metal music. One day he discovers that his hero, Sammi Curr, has died, supposedly burned by the establishment that wanted to put an end to his music. But Eddie has his last album, never published, and when he plays it, he starts receiving messages that tell him how to deal with his tormentors. In a short time, Sammi has revealed that he intends to return to life at the local Halloween party to take revenge on the city that once ridiculed him. <br /> <br /> Full of humor and jokes, this is a very entertaining movie. Sammi himself is an original villain of the horror movie, who plays with the obsessions of the 'evils of rock music' of the 80's. Well worth seeing.
