['Jess is 18 years old, she is very intelligent and wants nothing more than to play football. When he joins a local team, he has to lie to his parents again and again, since they would never approve that he would pursue his dream, they want him to calm down. A good Indian boy and learn to cook. <br /><br /> Bend it Like Beckham is a very funny and funny movie that does not need to be deep and complex, it is fine as it is. All the actors are very good and play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny. <br /><br /> A great family movie 8/10']
