I loved all the work of Cream, even though there is a catalog of works so small and precious to take. Even when they last up to twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are the best examples) they still bring out the socks of more than half of the rock acts that work today. This power to gel on stage is awarded one of the most anticipated meetings of rock bands in history with the Royal Albert Hall shows last year. It is possible that they have aged, like their followers, but the energy is still there, with the great arrangements of the classic blues songs, as well as their own. The interpretations of White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love, none seem to fail. The Clapton solos have a formation that sometimes does not have when he is on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker, I said enough. Jack Bruce is strong enough with his voices still with a kind of power that Clapton could never have on his own. In short, if you want to see what were the best programs that you wish you had seen last year (well, some may have seen them), everything is in this DVD, with excellent special features.
