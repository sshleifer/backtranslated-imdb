['As soon as I heard about this movie, I knew I had to see it. Well, I found out, then I found the trailer. After that, it was when I knew I had to see it. And I&#39;m so glad I did it. Do you want to watch classic television mixed with zombies? Do not? Then get lost. <br /><br /> FIDO is a movie that does not look like anything I&#39;ve ever seen. Well, actually, it&#39;s like it is. It&#39;s like an episode of Lassie and a Zombie movie. Although when combined, it feels completely new and original. FIDO is about a boy named Timmy and his new pet Fido. Well, this new pet is not a parakeet or a puppy trained to go to the bathroom. He&#39;s a re-animated dead guy ... a zombie. A large cloud of radiation enveloped the Earth, which led to all the dead rising, which followed the Zombie Wars. Although through the genius of Reinhold Giger, ZomCon&#39;s leading scientist, he discovered that if you destroy the brain, the zombie will perish, which will give us the advantage and victory in the Zombies War. Although due to persistent radiation, whoever dies becomes a zombie. What can be a problem especially with the elderly. Although Zomcom comes forward again with more advances, especially with the Collar of domestication. The necklace stops the zombie&#39;s need for human flesh and, therefore, makes it harmless as a house pet. But not everything is perfect in this zombie utopia, the necklaces are broken, the old ones die and ... well, I&#39;ll just let you see this incredibly unique movie. <br /><br /> FIDO is a fantastic idea brought to fruition. With a stellar cast and great writing, FIDO stands out above the majority in the comedy / horror genre. There are many fun and original situations that really entertained me. Although after watching the film, I personally believe that the film would have been better in black and white. With less than 90 minutes, the film does not last too long and moves from one scene to another at a good pace. It probably ends up being a cult classic, since it&#39;s not really a comedy of laughing out loud or even a horror movie. It&#39;s a comedy / family / zombie movie immersed in the atmosphere of 1950. If you thought that everything I said here was interesting by all means, watch this movie. But if you&#39;re still in the fence, turn your leg back and stay there. 8.5 out of 10']
