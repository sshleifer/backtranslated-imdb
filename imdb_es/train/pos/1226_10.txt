They filmed this movie on Long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently, there is a party scene in which everyone drinks beer (which they told me was colored water, disgusting taste and it was very difficult to keep swallowing again and again, especially in the funnel scenes). However, none of us have heard of the movie that premieres anywhere in any way. It never came out in theaters (obviously) and, as far as I knew, it was never released on video, and I'm sure it was not released on DVD. However, it seems that it was seen by some people, although probably very few. So there must be something. I would love to buy this for my brother, but there is no way to find it anywhere. Does anyone know anything about when / where / how can you buy this movie? And what format would it be?
