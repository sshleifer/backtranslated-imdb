In fact, there is much to complain about in this cinematic version of Molnar's mystical work. Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, stink. This also suffers, in large part, from being credited as the first film that makes use of the rear projection. However, the sets seem false. <br /> <br /> However, there are two great strengths in this show: although the readings of the dialogues are not firm, the visual presentations are perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, is little remembered nowadays, mainly by ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell reduced the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to shots of it: it credits the elegant visual direction of Melford of the original. However, one of the themes of Borzage is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great, from the arrival of the celestial train to the trip to the "Hot Place". HALF PENSION. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect. <br /> <br /> So here we have a defective but very interesting version. I think Lang's version of 1934 is better, as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the diluted musical remake. But I still enjoy this version a lot and I think you should give it a try.
