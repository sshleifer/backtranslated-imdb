Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger change the goodie-baddie roles they had in "All the brothers were brave." Taylor seems a little uncomfortable in his bad boy role, but Granger perfectly fulfills his role. However, the true hero in the story is the bison and the northwest. The film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given. The direction is tense and, although the film is not a joyful entertainment, it is, in my view, an important film, unjustly ignored by the experts.
