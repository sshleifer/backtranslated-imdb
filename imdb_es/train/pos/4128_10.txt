With all the violence on television and local news, it is refreshing to have a program that does not have violence or adult language, but that is still entertaining. My children expect to see us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judges. We all enjoy Elton Brown. We enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredient, vegetables and unique seasonings. We play at home to guess who will be the winner. <br /> <br /> It's a great hour of entertainment and information. Best of all in our hectic, hectic life, it is an hour that the family spends together.
