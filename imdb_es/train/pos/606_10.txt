I've seen many Saura movies and I've always thought it was amazing how he assembles music, dance, theater and great movies in his films. Ib√©ria shows an even better Saura, which deals with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that caught my attention is the fact that, in this film, the dancers and musicians, the dance and the music, are equally important: the camera shows several aspects of the interpretation of the music, examining not only the technical problems but also the emotional experience of touching. Saura's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient to make this film more aesthetically exciting than his other works. That's why I highly recommend it to those who love good movies, good music, good dancing, great art.
