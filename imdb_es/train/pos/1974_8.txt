I think the reason for all the diarrhea in this movie is that most people have it because Sharon Stone is around 50 and gets naked while playing sexy. Nobody cared when the Golden Girls sat down to eat cheesecake and discussed their first orgasm, but seeing someone post menopausal indulging digitally while driving, I think it's too much for some. Let's face it, it looks good, it's warmer light years than my mother who is the same age! It is not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first one, but since the turn of the century that is what all the spectators seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will move your soul. As such, it does not pretend to be either. It is an erotic thriller that is both erotic and exciting, and is the continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It is the character of Catherine Trammell who helped make way for this sequel. Fans of the first movie want to see more of that icy ice queen. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and art direction were exuberant and extravagant and made me want to move to Britian. The score is also amazing. <br /> <br /> Of course there is some overexcitement of some characters but there is a brilliant work by David Morrissey that is practically unknown. <br /> <br /> There is a mishap in that the script is practically the same as the first movie that only connects a psychiatrist instead of the police. In addition to the criminal decision of the MPAA to force the film to be further reduced, which eliminates the feeling of guilty pleasure for which the story is known. <br /> <br /> At least it's entertaining and it's fun to watch, and those are the only intentions of the movie. So, if you have meat with Mizz Stone, maybe you should SEE the movie and draw your own conclusions before throwing your projectile vomit?
