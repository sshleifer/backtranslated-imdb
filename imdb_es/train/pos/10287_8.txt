This is one of those movies that they promoted too much. If you watch television, then you may not see the movie. Almost all the funny scenes are damaged in the previews, except one that turns out that Jennifer Annisten is the most fun. It's Jim Carrey's typical humor and it's very funny. Just do not go to see this movie waiting for you to be surprised. In short, if you like Jim Carrey or the comedies, this is a must, otherwise, just look at the previews and you will be just as satisfied.
