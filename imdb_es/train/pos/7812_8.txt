A long film about a very important personage of South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died a long time before his normal time. The old movie, however, does not show how important Biko was, what it really represented. His life and his teaching are reduced to little, in the best of cases, some witty comments. Being the 1987 film, the goal was to push South Africa to the limit that would lead to liberation. So the film aims to show how irrational the South African supporters of apartheid are in 1987. To show this, the film must look beyond Biko's death, therefore, it should not focus on Biko but on a liberal journalist white and in escaping from the absurd. System in which he lives. His escape becomes necessary due to the victimization of which he is a victim, together with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book about Biko, after his death, and that can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape from South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this way to be realistic and true. It could not be. But the film has aged tremendously because it does not show South Africa with any historical distance, the same distance that has taken place under the presidency of Nelson Mandela and is called forgiveness whenever those who want to be forgiven speak out loud. The film is strong and emotional, but that historical limit weakens it today, especially because the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. All panegyrics books or films have that defect: they are looking at the person they should portray from a single point of view. That explains why the film has aged so much, it seems that it has been coming for a long time, as if nothing had changed at all. A remake is necessary. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Sorbonne Pantheon, University of Versailles Saint Quentin in Yvelines, CEGID
