Woohoo! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian), then I'm surrendering right now. In her short skirt, high boots and a pronounced bust line, she is a real babe, even if her zombie eyeshadow appears and disappears. This 30 minutes is undoubtedly the sexiest in the series. Look at the realistic and revealing wrestling match with Bronson until he hits her cheekily, ruining all the fun. Well, I should probably set aside my hormonal response. This is a half hour very well produced by that force underestimated behind the success of the series, Buck Houghton. Naturally, the producers want to start the third season with an entry above the average. It is the United States after the nuclear holocaust (we know this because she is part of the invading force) and there are only the Americans Bronson and the Soviet Montgomery, along with some twenty tons of realistic remains. They wander between the destruction in alternate moods, while we wonder how long biology will take to triumph over politics, which, of course, eventually does (lucky Bronson). And that's it. There are no real conversations, except for what Bronson has to say, which is quite exaggerated. However, the script is still entertaining and quite daring for its time, even suggesting that not all Russian women looked like truck drivers (a popular stereotype of the Cold War of the time). <br /> <br /> In passing: it is rather curious that the Bronson (Buchinsky) of very Slavic appearance was chosen as the American and Montgomery as bright as Slavic. Apparently, it must be the opposite. My guess is that the producers did not want to place the American in the physically weaker role of the woman, regardless of appearances. However, there may be little fear or the usual atmosphere of TZ, yet the episode is still very, very visible 30 minutes.
