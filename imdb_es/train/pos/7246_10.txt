This movie is completely ridiculous. The plot is not only atrocious, but the acting is horrible. The special effects are normal and the whole movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic desert. However, it is by far the funniest film ever made. It's 101 minutes of laughter due to the fact that we all know that there will be no fuel in 3000, nor in any El Camino. There are also other aspects that I will not spoil, just because they are the ones that make movies so stupid. I recommend this movie, just for its absolute idiocy. I have no idea who would see it expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if what you need is a good laugh, look at the Exterminators of the Year 3000!
