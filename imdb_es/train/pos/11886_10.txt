I really liked that movie. First, because it's a family movie. Secondly, because it offers a refreshing vision of how to deal with the news about HIV in a family, with much less hysteria than I normally see in movies. The brothers are very close, but they do not judge. His desire to protect the younger brother is noble, but it is not necessary in the end. I understand that Leo's choice of how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular among people, but I thought it was the right choice for him. I can not believe this was a French television show. It had great production values. I gave this movie a ten, and I think you will, too, once you've seen it.
