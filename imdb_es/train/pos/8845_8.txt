The beginning of this movie is a bit clumsy and confusing, but stay still, because you are ready for the trip of your life. The concept is convincing, with interesting devices used to tell the general story. There are excellent performances everywhere, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman being the best of the cast, not surprising. Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance too. Mr. Lumet's address is outstanding. The film has a feeling of the seventies in respect of the risks that are taken when telling this story, but unlike most of the trite movies that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is based on Sincerely in relationships instead of special effects or product plugs. . You will be rewarded greatly for the time invested in this movie.
