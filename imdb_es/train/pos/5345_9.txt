Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is once again in the direction of political confrontation. That is why this masterpiece must be shown in all Spanish secondary schools. It is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism. The American pilot who gets involved in the Spanish civil war elects the democratically elected republican government. The criminal role of religion is shown surprisingly well in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe has done. The colors are magnificent. The cruelty of a war (could anyone tell me the difference between any war and a civil war?) It is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. The cowards who initiate their abuse of power even against innocent children are now active again. A film like 'Carol's Journey' / 'Carol's Journey' tells one of the many sad stories of the 20th century. It's a better history lesson than any book could contain. Again great work from the Iberian Peninsula!
