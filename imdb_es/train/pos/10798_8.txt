['First I saw this gem by Joe Sarno when, and I must say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the movie was moving a bit slower than I would expect for a Sarno movie, but when Jennifer made her entrance, the first time I saw her somewhere, I sat down and realized. Her presence in this movie is difficult to avoid, and spice up every scene she is involved in. I have seen most of the rest of Sarno&#39;s films, and the other films starring Jennifer Welles, and I must say that this was both Sarno. and Jennifer at her best collective moment. Sarno&#39;s direction in this domestic adult drama film is excellent, and Jennifer showed (figuratively and literally) an acting skill that makes this a must-see. Co-stars Rebecca Brooke (also known as Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both frequent co-stars of Mrs. Welles, and also frequent stars of Sarno&#39;s work, become credible portrayals as a pair of adventurous but normal housewives. This movie is the classic one of Sarno.']
