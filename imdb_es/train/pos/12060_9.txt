I really miss the production of good Spooky movies. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory had been entrusted with the task of producing a film of this type, it could have been this, except for the lack of an internationally known first level cast. This is one of those movies you see alone on a dark night with a pizza and some popcorn, and you do not even bother washing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the sheets. Bravo to director Herbert Wise, writers Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, Jon Bunker's best production design, John Ralph's art direction and excellent cast to make me shudder and feel so isolated even though I live in a of the most populated cities In the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave him a "9" of "10" because with the television production and budget restrictions, they really made a great show.
