This is a hilarious movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship contract with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract has all kinds of humiliating clauses, like forcing Burt to wear a chicken suit during the race. Jim Nabors is his mechanical boss (not entirely convincing). Beatty assigns Loni Anderson (oh, yes!) For Reynolds to be honest and adhere strictly to the contract. This is a funny movie in which Burt shows he is not too proud. I like it!
