This is a truly classic film in its history, acting and film presentation. The wonderful actors are full throughout the movie, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart are the main characters. In real life she admired a lot and liked Jimmy, and in fact gave him his first acting roles, and helped him to be more at ease with his appearance on set. The "chemistry" between the two was always evident, and so warm and pleasant to contemplate. She was a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality portraits. The story of these two young people, and the way they finally come together at the end is lovely to watch, and pure magical entertainment. The other supporting actors in this wonderful story / film also give presentations to warm the heart. With all my heart, I give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, which has a special appeal for all generations. A must for all!
