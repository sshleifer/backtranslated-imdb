I read a little about Che before watching this film and you want to know something, he was a true hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for all and he hated what the oppressive forces were doing with his people. as well as all the other Latin Americans in general! Now, I do not know about the others, but for me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share. However, the powerful elite obviously was not going to go for that. Then, instead of understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him to try to repress the revolution. It did not work since there were many of his other followers who just continued where he left off. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As far as I'm concerned and as Che said just before he died: "If you kill me, that's fine, but you're just killing a man, you will NEVER kill the cause!" I could not have said it better. <br /> <br /> But ... IN NO WAY ... that's why I give this movie a 7 out of 10.
