A thin story with many fine shots. Callers here are the three ladies of the D.R.E.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the boy who accompanies them. Traci Lords convincingly acts as the feminine half of an evil business couple that intends to poison the world with anthrax. Original of this movie is the support bomb, placed on a captured member of the D.R.E.A.M. team. Of course, she is rescued by a partner, three seconds before the explosion. Although clearly borrowed by James Bond's "Goldfinger" and "You only live twice", such a climax always works well. In short, a good watch, James Bond was replaced here by three Charlie's Angels.
