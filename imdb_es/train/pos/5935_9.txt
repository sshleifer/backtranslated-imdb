['After seeing the terrible, the terrible, the terrible BATMAN: DEAD END I knew I had to see this as soon as I found out. <br /><br /> Pressing play to see the trailer, I thought I was expecting another horrible short of what until now seemed another malicious filmmaker trying to give a new depth to an existing character. But instead, he was greeted with a big trailer for a movie that, unfortunately, does not exist, because I would LOVE to see a finished movie, even if it only lasted 30 minutes. <br /><br /> The best in the world compensates BATMAN: DEAD END and something else. <br /><br /> I look forward to the next short film!']
