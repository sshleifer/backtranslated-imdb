I've seen this movie, when I was traveling in Brazil. I found it difficult to really understand Brazilian culture and society, because it has many regional and class differences. Watching this movie in Sao Paulo was a revelation. It shows something of the daily life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, sometimes it is too dramatized. And that is the only negative comment I have about this movie. Sometimes it's too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for a movie. The director could film some things a little more subtle, it would make the film more effective. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I liked the movie and the way the story unravels. The characters are complex, and they look a lot like real-life people. They are not pretty American actors and actresses with many cosmetics, but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time. That makes the film realistic, even when the story is not so convincing.
