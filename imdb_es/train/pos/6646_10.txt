Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for the freedom struggle of India, ignored his own family and son. This film is about his son Hiralal, who feels neglected by Mahatma Gandhi's service to society. The film begins in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and fights against the cause of India's freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father, who is a lawyer, since Gandhi was involved in the struggle for freedom, he wanted his wife and children to also join as a service to society and, as a result, hirarlal does not have the opportunity to complete his education and suspend his exams, he marries his gulab love (bhoomika Chawla) against the wishes of his father. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to England and become a lawyer like his father, but his father refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and, instead, gives it to someone else saying that The scholarship should not be limited to your family and should be open to the most worthy students who live in the colony. This infuriates Hiralal and the difference between father and son increases, Hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for not having an education and being unemployed. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands on the streets due to failed business ventures and in debt, loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna has given a stellar performance as Hiralal gandhi ... all the congratulations to him, the direction and the script are fantastic, the image is excellent. In general, an excellent movie and a must see. I give it a 10/10
