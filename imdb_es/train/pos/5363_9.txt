This is a classic 80s action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Located in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including television networks. One of its most popular television shows is "The Running Man", where convicted criminals are persecuted and killed for the entertainment of millions of people. It is configured as a game show, where the public votes for their favorite "stalkers", trained assassins who hunt and kill the unfortunate "contenders" of the program. Members of the audience also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. And the host is played by Richard Dawson of Family Feud, whose experience in game shows makes him ideal for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This movie is replete with classics from an Arnold line, such as his famous "I'll Come Back" just before he enters the arena. And he mocks a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "How about a light?" I could go on and on, but I do not want to ruin the movie. They are fun things! <br /> <br /> Whether for your intention or not, this movie is a great parody of today's "Reality TV" fashion. There are already numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation to entertain viewers, and even court cases are televised for their "entertainment value". Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV reached the bottom, and it is a terrifying image. You can only hope that networks have the common sense not to let it go so far. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
