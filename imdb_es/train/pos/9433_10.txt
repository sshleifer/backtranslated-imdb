['The shocking film of four inhabitants of the city in crisis in Appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity. Each of the four businessmen faces their darkest fears when faced with a challenging whitewater trip, in a river about to be replaced by a dam. When the villagers on the road decide to &quot;follow their path&quot; with the intruders, several deaths and many traumas for the survivors take place. Each of the travelers is outstanding, although Voight gives the leadership and the best performance. The landscape and rural culture are well captured, including the impressive sequence of dueling banjos. I saw this on a date when it came out, not exactly the perfect movie for the date (although we both enjoyed it). I remember that this was a dramatic performance for Burt, since Voight was already established. It&#39;s not the kind of movie you can watch every week, but it has a big hit and it&#39;s beautifully shot.']
