This film stars Jay Leno as Detroit policeman, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as Tokyo police sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car engine. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to an emerging car company run by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him, the men who had to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras, who led the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has none of that and threatens Jarryd by forcing him to continue his association. Meanwhile, in the same junkyard where they had killed the Japanese, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men. Tony's friend had been watching the junkyard. <br /> <br /> Tony sets out to find the killer against the order of his superior. Tony is in a robbery while obviously the homicide should investigate the case. While Tony investigates the crime, he runs into the Japanese police officer and, by mistake, arrests him. Eventually they end up working together on the case. They make a weird pair and there are some really fun parts, as well as some ridiculous scenes like Pat Morita jumping and kicking through the windshield of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head. But it ends up being a friendly friend's police movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is nice in the role and Pat Morita is also good. Still, they make one of the most unlikely duos of friends in an action movie. If you liked the movies of friends, movies of 80 or if you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, I recommend this movie.
