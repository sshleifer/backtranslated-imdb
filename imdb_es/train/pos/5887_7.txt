So Mary and Rhoda have aged, who does not? I was a teenager when Mary opened, and a "young adult" when she left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, maybe the film did not support the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that reminded the spirit of the series to make this an appropriate tribute. Example: the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea of ​​a new series about "old people". Is not this typical of the current mentality of Hollywood television and the movie "bean counters"? This may not be the MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best, but it is a very good look at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s.
