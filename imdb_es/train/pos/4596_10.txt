This is Jackie Chan's best movie, and my personal favorite. After the disappointing US UU They created "The Protector", directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and placed it in Hong Kong. This is also probably the most violent movie of Jackies, with the audience shrugged by the acrobatics. The action is fast and furious, Jackie and her team really put a lot of effort into the design of the fight. Bones were broken and blood was spilled in the process of making this movie as you will see in the credits. <br /> <br /> The script is a simple matter of cops and robbers, nothing special, after all, was written around the action. I must say that the English version has a bit of dubious dubbing, but it should not hurt you too badly. <br /> <br /> Then, get the boys back, open the beers and enjoy. By the way, the film was nicknamed 'Glass Story' by the team of specialists. Why? I'll let you discover it for yourself !!
