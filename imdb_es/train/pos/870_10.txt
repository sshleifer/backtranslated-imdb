"Read My Lips (Sur mes l√®vres)" (which probably has different idioms in its French title) is a witty and twisted contemporary account of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a hindrance to crime when unusually matched characters are Slide up and down in an ethical and sensual slippery slope. <br /> <br /> The two tracks are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (whom I've never seen before despite his extensive resume in French films) and even more disheveled than usual, Vincent Cassel (who has brought an Appearance and / or sexy and / or threatening expression of some movies from the USA). <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is in its territory in a competitive real estate office and he is the neophyte. The second half is in its territory as an ex-convict and its harrowing adaptation to that environment. <br /> <br /> The writer / writer Jacques Audiard very intelligently uses the isolated auditory disability of the woman as an input for us in his perceptions, raising and lowering the sound so that we listen to what she does (for what it is even more annoying than normal when audience members talk), using images also as sensory reactors. <br /> <br /> None of the characters act as anticipated (She is not like that flexible victim of "In the Company of Men", not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the general arc of the plot unpredictable (well, until the last shot, but the audience was expecting that fulfillment) as we move from a busy modern office, to a busy nightclub, to romantic and criminal stakes. <br /> <br /> There is a side story that is thematically redundant and unnecessary, but that gives us a few minutes to catch our breath. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites of the year! <br /> <br /> (originally written on 07/28/2002)
