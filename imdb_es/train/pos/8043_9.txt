I've heard people say that this movie is boring and boring. I do not think they were watching the right movie. This is not the prototypical action movie, thank God. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama about the newbie and his mentor that is simply about killing people. In this way, it works extremely well, with excellent performances by Berenger and Zane (who does not walk alone through the film as he has done in other roles, it actually seems to be acting). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. with the action towards the end, a lot of that did not make much sense and was unsatisfactory given the accumulation of the rest of the film. But watch Zane's face as he panics, alone, while Berenger does the dirty work.
