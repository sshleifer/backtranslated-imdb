I saw this movie last night at a special cinema in NÃ¼rnberg, and it was excellent. I have to admit that the original musical composition of the cello and the percussionist / xylophone influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also had strength in its interpretation of the tragic Nibelungen saga. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent films or in Nibelungenlied, I recommend this movie. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic, and the performance was dramatic and impressive (as is typical of the "tragedies" of silent films). Unfortunately, I have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after the death of Siegfried, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Nordic versions of the story) begins to plan his revenge against his brothers. <br /> <br /> In addition, I saw this movie in German; I am a native speaker of English and I have basic knowledge of German. It was difficult to read the subtitles (what is that called in the silent films?) At first due to the old style of the German script, so I advise that if you see it in German make sure you can differentiate your "k's", "f's" and "s's" in the previous script. :)
