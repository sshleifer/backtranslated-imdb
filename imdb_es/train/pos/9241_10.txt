Hello people, what's wrong? It's me, the one and only Mike "Sonny Sakura Killer" Kelly. You know ........ you can not really write a review on Sakura's script, because there we did not have one. As far as I know, history was invented as we went along. I had the best moment of my life doing that movie, and I stunned so much that I ran out of Jism ........... fun moments. So glad that everyone enjoyed the movie. I really could not do the fights I had planned. Every time I set some movements, the fight director kept changing them. Still, I had a lot of fun and I met really cool people. Especially the purple female ninja who seems to have detached herself from the cinematic scene.
