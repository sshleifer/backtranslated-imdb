In the classical sense of the four humors (which are not specific to the concept of fun or even entertainment), Altman "H.E.A.L.T.H." It deals with all the humors, and really in a very funny and entertaining way. There is Phlegm, as personified by Ester Brill, the very slow, cautious and protective character of Lauren Bacall, whose mission in life seems to have to do with appearance, protecting the secrets of her age and beauty rather than her well-being. There's Dr. Gil Gainey, wrathful Paul Dooley, who likes a fish out of the water (perhaps more like a seal) turns frantically, barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness. Isabella Garnell, of Glenda Jackson's Melancholy, smells of Hamlet with Shakespeare's problems and complacency, even offering one or two soliloquies. And let's not forget the character Bile Hammer by Henry Gibson ("The breast that feeds the baby rules the world"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), relatively healthy characters who struggle to find some kind of balance between all the companions and extreme moods that have gathered for H.E.A.L.T.H. - a kind of world trade organization specialized in H.E.A.L.T.H., which is nothing more than health. This is Altman at its best classic moment.
