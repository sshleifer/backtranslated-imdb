['Terry Gilliam gives an awesome movie, which I enjoyed a lot. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the small appearance of Christover Plummer makes the film absolutely brilliant. This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I&#39;ve seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely in my top 10. I think this is one of Bruce Willis&#39; four best films; and the best of Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt offers perfect performance. Possibly one of the ten best actors I&#39;ve seen in my life. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincing. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt performed extraordinarily well. With the brilliant history of supporting great performances; And to support that, the excellent address of Terry Gilliam.']
