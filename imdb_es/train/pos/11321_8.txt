When I started watching the show I said "Oh no, it's as cheesy as Elfen Lied and not even bloody!" And, in fact, the configuration is almost identical, since only the young person lives alone in a large house, and then suddenly gets involved in a fantastic adventure, while the sexy young people live with him. <br /> <br /> But this is where the resemblance stops. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as Inuiyasha's, while the comments and behaviors of children are very few. The magic setting is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all the servants are famous, half of all the teachers are from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. However, this soon fades and fades because of the beauty of the drawing and the script. <br /> <br /> Actually, I saw the 24 episodes in a day and, without comparing it with animes that I liked more, but they were of other genres, I have to say that I was very happy.
