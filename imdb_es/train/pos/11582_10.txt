For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror comic strip, watching this movie is an exercise in nostalgia. In that context, it's wonderful, but the younger viewers will certainly find the comedy lazy and they would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters. The plot is also a little loose for today's audience, but it reflects very well the ingenuity of the 40s and 50s. Jane, you must remember, was part of the escapist fantasy of the war years, created to raise the morale of the troops. She gave a double meaning to the "strip" in the comic strip. <br /> <br /> The story has something in common with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The subject would have been familiar to the readers of that time, a bunch of clumsy Nazis frustrated by a few equally awkward Englishmen and, of course, in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> For Jane's fans, a must see. For the rest of you, a wet squib. <br /> <br />
