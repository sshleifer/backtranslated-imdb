I really liked that movie. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy. This movie had so much excitement and it felt so real that I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I see it, the end makes me cry. I can really identify with the character of Busy Phillip, and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think all high schools should show this movie, maybe it prevents people from doing it. Do the same thing I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone. Especially to those who have been affected by school shooting. <br /> <br /> It really is one of the best movies of all time.
