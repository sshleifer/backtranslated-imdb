['Having seen most of Ringo Lam&#39;s films, I can say that this is his best film to date and the most unusual. It is an ancient piece of the Chinese era full of martial arts, where the location of an underground den full of traps and dungeons plays a role as important as any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the stage design is truly memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise has not been made available on DVD and it is almost impossible to get your gloves, even if you are near the second largest Chinese city in North America (like me). If you can find it, do not let it pass.']
