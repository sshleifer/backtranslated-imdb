This movie can be played on many different levels. Do not listen to the other comments hitting the film and saying that it is a story reproduced again or that it is only about drugs. He has very open superficial metaphors about drugs; However, the rest of the movie (and why I think it was made personally) really is not about that at all. It is really a psychological mockery and the conditioning of society. It shows, for a fraction of a second, that the main character's brother is watching those sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it is to show that all this stupidity to which we are exposed makes it easier for us to be mechanics in our professions instead of seeing people as people. As for the scene on logic, it is also reaching the people who attended the smart classes with a 1% federal mandate that are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable, mathematical and logical as it seems at a macroscopic level. He must apply Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all other laws and uncertainty principles) not only to physics, but to life and leave room to change his plans and adjust along the way. One of the best movies I've seen in my life. It could go well above your head; It is not for you, it is for those people who are having problems to cope with life that do not work as a math problem. When you are critically analyzing a film or writing your critical review, try not to read the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists)
