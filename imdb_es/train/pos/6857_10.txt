['&quot;Dressed to kill&quot;, is one of the best thrillers ever made. His relationships with sex and violence make this an adult movie. Brian De Palma, once again, demonstrates why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story. He directs many scenes without dialogue, and tells much of his story, strictly through the use of his images and the brilliant score of Donnagio Pine. Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be viewed in widescreen, since De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell its story. Cropped, in the video, &quot;Dressed To Kill&quot;, is just the same movie. The solid performances of his cast, the magnificent direction and, perhaps, the best cinematographic score ever written, make &quot;Dressed To Kill&quot; a must see.']
