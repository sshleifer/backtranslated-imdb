The film is dividing from the beginning, Eddie seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny, from having an ice cream as a child to the long tradition of the family. The movie is very rare in this country, but I'm not sure of the availability in other countries, I've searched many websites and I have not had any luck yet, I've telephoned companies that are looking for rare videos and there are waiting lists for years . So the tracks are very welcome. If someone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees the video get it, it's worth it and it can not go wrong.
