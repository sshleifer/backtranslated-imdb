The information contained in this film is familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately. The Walter Reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job looking after our wounded heroes when they return. <br /> <br /> What this film shows is a truth common to all wars. The psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while participating in the war and the difficulty they have when they return to civilian life. Not only are people changed or affected, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with it because they do not know themselves. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film shows what the army does with our young people. in women to prepare them for war and the policies and practices they must follow to process the war that leads to all the psychological trauma. <br /> <br /> We have more than 3000 soldiers killed in the four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands who will suffer physical and psychological traumas for life because of this war. No matter which side you are on, it is up to you to know the cost of the war to decide if we should be in that business. This film perfectly illustrates the costs for men and women.
