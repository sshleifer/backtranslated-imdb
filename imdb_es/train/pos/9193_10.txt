It is very faithful to the original manga of the same name, also known as (Tramps Like Us in the US), but you can still enjoy it even if you have not read the manga. It is a different type of tail, which shows a strong and independent woman who hurts like everyone else. However, due to her external strength, she is afraid to show her inner feelings and, therefore, let those around her hurt her with her blunt comments. The only one who really discovers her and with whom she can be comfortable is her new human ... human ... Momo. If you want something different than normal boring with some wonderful actors / resses of J-Dorama (Japanese drama), then this is definitely the series to watch ... and read!
