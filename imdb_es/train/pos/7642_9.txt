It's not really a big box office draw, but I was pleasantly surprised <br /> <br /> with this movie. James "I did some things to Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> co-wrote and directed this film about a normal guy <br /> <br /> named Larry Burrows who believes his life would have been <br> /> <br /> incredibly different if he hit a home run in a key baseball game <br /> <br /> when he was 15 years old. But thanks to the mysterious and magical bartender <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry fulfills his wish, but soon realizes that his new life <br /> <br /> is not exactly as expected. <br /> <br /> I must say that this movie really impressed me. Critics have given <br /> <br /> a mix, and I must say that the concept is really interesting and <br /> <br /> was carried out well. Yes, it is a bit standard, but it has enough fun, dramatic and excellent acting moments to make it really good. James Belushi (I think) was Oscar worthy for his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton and Renee Russo shine in <br /> <br /> their roles. Michael Caine is perfect as the bartender. It's <br /> <br /> just a good movie with a good lesson. If you've never seen, I recommend that you review
