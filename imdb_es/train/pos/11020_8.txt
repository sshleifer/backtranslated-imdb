After the unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber (Michelle Joyner). It's been eight months ... The Rocky Mountain Rescue receives a distress call established by a brilliant terrorist genius Eric Quaien (John Lithgow). Who has lost three large boxes that have millions of dollars inside. Two experienced climbers, Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and Tucker (Micheal Rooker) and a helicopter pilot (Janine Turner) are on the rescue, but Quaien and his men put them in a trap. Now the two climbers and the pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek. While Quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped Tucker to find the money. Once Tucker finds the money, Tucker will be dead. Against explosive firepower, bitter cold and vertiginous heights. Walker must make fun of Quaien to survive. <br /> <br /> Directed by Renny Harlin (Driven, Mindhunters, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master) created an entertaining non-stop action image. This movie is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action image with a lot of dark humor too. This was one of the biggest hits of 1993. This is one of the best films of Harlin. Lithgow is an excellent entertaining villain. Stallone certainly made a brief comeback from this sharp thriller. This is probably Harlin's best work as a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a large anamorphic Widescreen transfer (2.35: 1) and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. DVD has a track of comments from the director with comments from Stallone. DVD also has technical comments from the crew as well. The DVD has behind-the-scenes features, two deleted scenes with director introduction and more. Do not miss this great action movie.
