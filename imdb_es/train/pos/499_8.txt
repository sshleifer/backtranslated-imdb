['The Enterprise pilot lacks something from the original Star Trek: a dose of realistic and flawed personalities. The utopian characters of the next generation got tired, they were so noble that they were incredible. I also like the secondary plot that humans are bitter towards the Vulcans. It&#39;s funny to see them as pretentious snobs. It makes me wait to see when humans become the dominant race between the two, although I do not think it works in the time frame of the show. The only negative aspects that came to me were the feeling of ending the &quot;fast cut of the end at 2 o&#39;clock&quot;, which is common among many of the Trek shows. The second was the brazen excavation of the classifications of a couple of sensually sensual scenes. It was out of place, a good science fiction program should be able to stand on its own without trying to cover the preadolescent audience with some skin. But it&#39;s not my job to make the show profitable, so good. <br /><br /> Let&#39;s see how the next episode looks.']
