Poor Basil Rathbone, a selfish composer who has lost his muse. He has been faking it for some time, buying his lyrics and his music from various sources. The problem is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and (words of Mary Martin) meet and fall in love. And then they discover what they have been doing. Complications occur, but everything is corrected at the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing terribly. Mary had signed a contract with Paramount and, at the same time, she had doubled as a regular on the Kraft Music Hall radio program in Crosby. For reasons I do not understand, the movie audience was not interested in her, so she went back to Broadway and did One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone in one of the few times He played comedy very well. His ego is constantly being deflected by comrade Oscar Levant and again I am surprised that they have not made more movies together. <br /> <br /> As with most Crosby Paramount vehicles, there are no large production numbers, but I agree with the previous reviewer about the tune of the title that is performed as an impromptu session in a house of pawn Good job for everyone. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
