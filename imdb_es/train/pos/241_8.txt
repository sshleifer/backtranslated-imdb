I'm tired of people judging movies because of their "historical accuracy". IT'S A CINEMA PEOPLE! Writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin on history! There are a number of films that are not entirely accurate with the story ... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: An American legend, The Last of the Mohicans ... all fantastic movies that are historically inaccurate. If you want to see some great actors do what they do best, then I suggest you watch this movie and do not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Only enjoy the quality of the film, the story and one of the best actors of our time.
