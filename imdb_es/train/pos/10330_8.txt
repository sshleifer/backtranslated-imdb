This is actually a trilogy of 3 short stories by Somerset Maugham. The first is The Verger, which lasts about 15 minutes and is very nice. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is fired from his job in the church because he can not read or write. So what does he do? Open a tobacco shop, of course! <br /> <br /> The second one is Mr. Know-All, which was actually a story I had read at school 6 years ago and had forgotten at once, until I heard the family introduction. Another 15 minute one, and also very good. It worked better on film than in a book for me, but maybe that's because I was only 14 years old the last time, after all. <br /> <br /> The third is almost a disappointment. Nearly an hour long, just drag. It's not so bad, but not as fast and agile as the last two. I saw the first quarter of an hour and then I jumped into the last quarter of an hour, and I found that it still made sense and I really had not missed a thing! <br /> <br /> In general, I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10, respectively.
