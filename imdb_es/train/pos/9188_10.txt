It is a pity that many people have not understood this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But do not worry! I'll explain it to you too :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into 2 parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's "dream" in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now what people did not understand is that Tony's dream is more than just a dream. In this episode it is about his preparation for his death. It loses its own identity and, finally, it even forgets itself, so it disconnects all its links with this world. You will notice what I am saying in the doctor's scene, where Tony says he lost his briefcase containing "his life". The manufacturers really did an excellent job interpreting their own thoughts about what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, you will see that this and the next episode are something unique, with great spiritual meanings. <br /> <br /> As in all soprano episodes, the acting and filming are excellent. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not understand was what was the role of the monks. I'll see him again until he gets this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode really touched me, and I do not think anyone else can see better what happens in a near-mortal experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 without a doubt.
