I just sat through a very fun 45 minute ROLL pace. <br /> <br /> This is a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone), who dreams of becoming a sports star. Mat travels to the city and will be picked up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and is making a delivery for him. It goes without saying that Mat is dragged into George's world. <br /> <br /> I thought it was great how Mat teaches George some moral and respect, while George teaches Mat how to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien were well connected and did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> All the characters in the film congratulated themselves very well, the two cops were great. David Ngoombujarra brought a great comic relief to the movie. Tiny played a nice gangster who reminded me of one of my favorite characters 'Pando' from Two Hands. <br /> <br /> One of the other things that I liked about Roll was that it showed the cities I grew up in and Lived in 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see places of interest and landmarks that I grew up with, especially the old wheel of fortune. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
