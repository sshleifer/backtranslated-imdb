This movie is not morbid, nor depressing. It's sad, because AIDS in the early 90's was sad. But his real message is one of love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long-term love relationship. Their devotion to each other is immediately apparent, and as the ravages of AIDS increase and become the focal point of their lives, it is seen that strength and commitment are truly comforting. <br /> <br /> When "Silverlake Life" was Originally released, I participated deeply in education about HIV / AIDS and health care, as a volunteer as an advisor in an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other film about AIDS of its time, because Mark and Tom were real people and lived the experiences that I saw daily in real life. I knew from first-hand experience what it was like to see how AIDS ate people who were once vibrant, young and healthy; Seeing how Mark and Tom were doing in the movie was a lot like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. It moved me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.
