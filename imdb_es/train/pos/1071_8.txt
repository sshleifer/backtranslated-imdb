I definitely needed some work in season 2. Like the Virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White along with his old and super cult. However, during the second season, the only thing that kept me looking was to see if Max and Logan would get rid of the nasty virus that infected Max. Very good drama in the second season. But, of course, like all television shows, if something goes wrong with that, the broadcast company takes it off the air. I was seriously looking forward to a third and final season. Season 2 leaves you hanging, unless you read the books of Max Allan Collins, then you will know what happens. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel must go back on the air for one more season, although it can cost a lot just to get all the original actors back. Since the bearer of Jessica Alba was shot after the show. If that were the case, then there should be a movie to complete it. Like the Firefly show, which of course also canceled FOX.
