This movie is a moving work, incredible. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 years old and I did not understand it at all ... I saw it again when I was 20 years old (in the video, of course, now I have it) and I did it. Simply blown away Steven Spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you involved in it from start to finish. I have also read the book, but there is something in the movie that really gives it life. The casting, the acting, the music, the costumes, the stage, everything, just wonderful. rees, cries, encourages ... brings out all imaginable emotions. It is one of his best works and should not be missed!
