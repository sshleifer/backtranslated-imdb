<br /> <br /> Robot jox is a great little movie. Some of the sets are bad and the acting is not so good, but the special effects are very good for a movie of this size and age. You must remember that this movie is more than 10 years old and it became very cheap in the first place, so you can not regret much of the bad parts. So sit down and watch a great movie with big robots in it.
