['I saw this movie on Comedy Central a couple of times. This movie was pretty good. It is an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who is willing to marry the king of Ohtar, so that the USA. UU They can get a military base there to balance power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including &quot;Sunnygate&quot;. I also loved the final theme. It gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.']
