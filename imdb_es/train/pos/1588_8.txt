* What I like about SPOILERS * Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with elder sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she does not know half of the strange things that will happen to her from now on, and not only to her, but to her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), her boyfriend Henry (Michael). McMillian), crushes Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie Jeff's boyfriend (Simon Rex), first boss (then fireman and then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you do not have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; If you only like sophisticated comedy, this is not for you. If you like a funny, sometimes poignant show, with two hot girls who can act in front (and none other than the fabulous 'Mary Cherry' by Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), what the hell are you waiting for? ? Welcome to Tyler's House! What I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
