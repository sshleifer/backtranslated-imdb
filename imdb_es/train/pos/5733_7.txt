I'm going to tip the scales a little here and say I enjoyed this. However, the caricature will really only appeal to those who have very absurd tendencies. It is definitely something that most people will not get, as is the nature of absurdity. <br /> <br /> The animation is horrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is disgusting, violent and stupid. There are no redeeming qualities at all. his wife screams and moans, seemingly barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any kind of point. <br /> <br /> but again, that's the point;) <br /> <br /> If what is not a kidnapper, rude language, and complete and absolute randomness is your thing. , this is going to love you. <br /> <br /> It's really short, so I would probably rent instead of buying.
