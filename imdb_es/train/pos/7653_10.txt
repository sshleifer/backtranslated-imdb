Shot in the heart is wonderful. It brilliantly illustrates the plight of Gary Gimore, a convicted murder who requested death. Shot in the Heart shows the terrible experience suffered by Gilmore's family, torn by hatred. This movie is an incredible psychological study, and it's wonderfully depressing and uplifting. 10/10
