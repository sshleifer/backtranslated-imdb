['Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids love, and mom and dad can also have fun watching. Growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed this movie, it&#39;s the plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD, so when I have my own children, they can have as much fun watching this movie as I do. The plot is fun, A group of children, embark on a journey that never waited, when they were launched into space by a robot that exceeded the limits. At first they were in auh, but when they realized that they did not have enough oxygen to recover the panic. Once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to Earth as best friends and a new respect for life.']
