No movie has caught my attention like this. You see, I've wanted to see this movie again for more than twenty-five years. The only time I saw it was in adolescence, which may have been the year of its release, 1977. <br /> <br /> What I do remember about the film is that it touched those deep emotions. so deeply that there is still an overwhelming desire to see it again. The intrigue that this film provides for the human element of the search and search of the father / son will surely affect every human soul that sees it. I dont know. Why this movie has not been taken out of storage and has been shown as often as many other films of less depth. <br /> <br /> PostScript: I received a copy of the movie and, after seeing it, I loved watching it. that my memory remained true. The rating reflects the content of the film. I would like to see this movie on DVD, since this 1977 production on a used VHS tape took away the overall quality.
