Not many people like Bertrand Blier films simply because they do not understand them. Simply because they are different types of people. <br /> <br /> If you have not been living in deep despair intertwined with great personal hope, it may be difficult for you to enjoy the blier humor shown here. <br /> <br /> And Blier's film can not be easily classified as black or cult comedy, etc., like those of pulp fiction, etc. Because there is this delicacy that the North American audience does not usually appreciate. <br /> <br /> When I looked at these two "hooligans" having dinner with Jeanne Moreau in the restaurant by the sea, I felt that they were gentler than any gentleman could have been. <br /> <br /> The impulse to make love like crazy is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of being meaningless symbolized by the truck that suddenly emerges in the Carrefour. <br /> <br /> SO, valseuses is a much better name than going to places. To dance a waltz you must be elegant, but go to places you do not.
