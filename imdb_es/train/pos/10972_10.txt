I only saw him recently, but I've known him for several years and his title has always intrigued me. Now it belongs to me as one of my favorite movies. It is difficult to describe the incredible theme that Maysles discovered, but everything works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments in which you feel you are invading a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and the characters in it. It is as if the filmmakers had enchanted the audience and taken us to the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be away from everything, cooking my corn on my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates everything. A fall of greatness for this family that was once estimated. The money was gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It attracted me from the first frame and long after the movie ended, I found myself wondering about its destiny. I wonder if, if I walked along East Hampton Beach, I could still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the hanging crack. Unforgettable.
