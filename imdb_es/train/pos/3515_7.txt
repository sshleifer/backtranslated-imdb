Very good image of a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the killer wanted to hit the lady, why not just take her out and let the police try to find out who the killer was? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths that you would have to worry about remaining closed. Why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit on a chair or say a word? Are there really policemen out there who are wise cracks, gum bursts, smiling monkeys approaching a suspect in such a simplistic manner? This was probably played well before the wheel was invented, but nowadays it is so cheesy and incredible. Catch the breakdown of the manic drum by Elisha Cook; His frantic hammering never coincided with the recording. His crazed facial expressions made the timing misplaced.
