The good thing about Withnail & I is that he realizes that not long ago he left university and that life could go at any time along with all his other finery. Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and simply went directly to work at the age of 15/16. I know some of the wide blades nailed the knife in this movie when it came out in the theaters, but I saw it in a house packed in Hailsham and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. I grew up in the forest of Dean and this took me back to my days of addiction to mushrooms and drugs (I had some great companions, I hate to think about what they are doing so far, probably in the local council). I have seen it a couple of times on DVD and I already see the film as an old companion that will remain forever as part of my collection (how can I like this movie and the Dambusters? It does not seem right to me in any way). edge towards the second half of this movie and I think the scenes of social interaction with the locals are brilliantly done. I like the mix of the three main characters and there are really some lovely writings here along with some very easy lines to quote and I dare say a bit of integrity. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it has not been released (shame, since it is a plug). Someone told me that it was originally a play, not quite sure how it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little touches / Shakespearian references that seem to emerge throughout the film (I also discovered the reference of Dylan Thomas) and, like all the little gems, there will always be little things to discover, like the final scene that gives a wink to Easyrider as They begin their next trip. In short, a genuinely unpretentious piece of film (I love it!)
