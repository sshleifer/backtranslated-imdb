The concept of having Laurel and Hardy this time in the role of fireplace sweepers is surprisingly fun. Guarantees some funny situations and silly pranks, especially Stan Laurel, of course, as usual. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a secondary plot with a crazy professor who is working on a rejuvenating formula. It does not really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent, but both story lines combine perfectly towards the memorable ending. It's still a little weird, but nevertheless it's fun, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of the film is surprising. Sam Adams is great as the stereotyped butler and Lucien Littlefield is deliciously exaggerated like the crazy professor. <br /> <br /> The film is full of some excellent synchronized and hilarious sequences, which are quite predictable but nevertheless, they become fun to watch thanks to the way they are executed. All this helps make "Dirty Work" one of the best shorts Laurel and Hardy. <br /> <br /> 8/10
