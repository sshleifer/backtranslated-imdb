"Hamlet" by Kenneth Branagh hits all brands. The performance is magnificent, the 70 mm cinematography is magnificent, the costumes and the Oscar nominated sets are impressive, and Patrick Doyle's score (also Oscar-nominated) is sensitive and moving. Oh yes, the script, from a guy named Will S., is not that bad either. Film critics criticized Branagh for receiving the fourth nod to the Oscar of the film for "adapting" the script, but his decision to use the full text was brave. I can not think of better ways to fly the four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost all of Branagh's decisions work brilliantly: the use of the Blenheim Palace in England for exteriors, the Edwardian dress and the staging of "Being or not being in a room" mirrors, to name a few. The casting of Hollywood luminaries, such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor parts, can be distracting, but that's nothing interesting. The main cast stands out: Derek Jacobi captures the conflicting nature of Claudio; Kate Winslet sharply shows Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie brings passion to her interpretation of Gertrude; Richard Briers is perfect for the tone as the deceptive Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell elevates Horace's potentially ungrateful role to the apotheosis of true friendship. Each speech, each line, each word is delivered with passion and conviction; There is not a lost moment in the whole movie. The final scenes magnify the scope of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way that is not possible with theatrical adaptations. <br /> <br /> Branagh's "Hamlet" is a bold, ambitious and, ultimately, successful attempt to combine the greatness and poetry of Shakespeare's language. Images equally eloquent. Could it be said that it is the best adaptation of Shakespeare ever filmed? I praise hard, but well deserved.
