The David Lynch movie (1999) of the John Roach / Mary Sweeney story takes place in Iowa and Wisconsin long before the film's final release. <br /> <br /> We come to the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) in recent times in life. His medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it. <br /> <br /> This makes what he decides to do even more remarkable and endearing. He decides (and at each point in the movie, his own name reverberates through his actions) to clarify some things. <br /> <br /> Alvin is, at this moment in his life, a man of great experience but modest. medium. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) fights against a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort for the audience. But it's worth it, because Rose's story can not help but leave as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> This movie is the story of a trip. But like all trips, it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. At the beginning of the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which no elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake. <br /> <br /> But on the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications. They equip you to achieve your unlikely goal. Its objective is very simple and direct. His brother is sick and is likely to die and he wants to visit him. He has had a fight with him for many years and they have not spoken in a long time. <br /> <br /> On the way, Alvin knows many people. The way he behaves with them and the benefit they get from having met him is the essence of this film. We got to know who Alvin Straight is, what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the movie, we know who we are ... better.
