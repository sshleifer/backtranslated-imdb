When a small town is threatened by a child killer, a police officer pursues him by posing as his friend. As she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the killer, her psyche begins to get beat up, which makes her lose focus in the job of catching the criminal. It is not a high-voltage emotion movie, but a solid police work and a good representation of the defective mind of a psychotic loser.
