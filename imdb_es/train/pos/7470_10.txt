I went to see Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge! Tom Cruise, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say? The film impressed me completely and especially the performance of TC. I thought it was a very moving movie and it was not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I read the reviews and decided not to go see them, I'm so glad I was "Forced to see it." The strange thing is that I can not say why, all I can say is that I found him totally involved. and I could not stop thinking about it the next day.As for what I felt about the movie, all I can say is that it's NOT THE WRITING LINE (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever) it's about the people and the events that shape your life and how small events can change, like getting on a car all the time ... <br /> <br /> As for what the critics wrote, yes, maybe the Original was an impressive second film for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this was a totally different interpretation of the theme, and in no way a narcissistic remake for the benefit of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> Not even I can consider writing a couple of trivial and simplistic sentences to describe the movie icle, just go and see it! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know this is not a balanced and thoughtful review, but what. It's not that kind of movie.
