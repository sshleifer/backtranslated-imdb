It seems like it should be a biography of Claude Monet, but it's actually a very focused story of the relationships between three teenage girls in a French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers to talk about, no school, and the children are represented by a peripheral figure, the hunky Francois who enter the history determined from time to time and always leave confused. <br /> <br /> Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three, just aspired to join the team she admires so much. She is a bit strange. She has not yet emerged from her accelerated growth in adolescence and has long, bony limbs, large feet and no back to talk about. She is prognatho and has fun with those pursed lips pursed. After a while, its appearance grows in you and from certain angles it can seem fascinating. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older, more, well, more physically developed. What a glamorous figure is cut in his bathing suit, spinning, mocking the boys, brandishing his long blond hair. But she is not what she seems. Or is she? I could not understand it. The French are long in paradoxes and short in consistency. No wonder Francois is always sniffing behind her. <br /> <br /> There is not much ambiguity in the character of Louse Blachere. She is also on the team, but she is chubby, simple and sensitive, and is very much in love with Francois. Blachere is a good actress and adds to the laziness of the character through his performance. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the relationships between these three, which means intrigues, deceptions, hidden feelings and everything else of what we do. Partner with young girls who spend a lot of time with each other. This is, of course, a difficult issue. It becomes more complicated during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. It's not like you should expect this to be a soft porn movie. The only nudity we see is considerably less than a shift, and the little sex under the sheets, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I do not think he wants to get into the plot or his analysis too much, partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action, partly because it's complex, and partly because I'm not sure that I have everything <br /> <br /> Let me give an example. Good. Adele is the girl that others envy. She is also quite distant and self-satisfied. On top of that, he's apparently fooling all the boys and men in sight if they can be of any use to him, from the handsome but foolish Francois to the bus driver he wants a favor from. She boasts unashamedly of her experience in fellatio. When Pauline approaches her to join the swim team, Adele uses her as a watchman during assignments with the boys. A superior narcissist and self-indulgent, you know? But then the whore soi-disant takes the skinny Pauline under her wing and reveals to Pauline that she is still a virgin. Really? Yes really. Pauline begins to approach Adele and Adele finally confesses that she would like to get rid of her hymen and would like Pauline to do it for her. Pauline, now sexually attracted to Adele, performs the task with moderate gusto. NOW, Adele would REALLY like to get in touch with a man, preferably older and more experienced. So she takes Pauline to a boîte where she seduces with a boy until she follows Pauline to the dressing table. The two girls stared at each other, without having openly expressed a sexual interest tinged in the other. But Adele is so close that Pauline slowly loosens her own reins, approaches and kisses Adele on the lips. Adele backs down, smiles and says: "There was not so bad, right?", And then go back to the club. <br /> <br /> That's a pretty accurate description of what's going to happen. between Pauline and Adele, but what the hell is going on? Initially, Adele treats Pauline as an irrelevant child, then as a close friend, finally as a possible lover, and the moment Pauline responds, Adele leaves satisfied. Are you using Pauline the way she seems to be using men? Does Adele satisfy that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I despise Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio, the flat, overgrown wall flower whose expression always suggests stupidity, but at least is completely heterosexual and the first of the three to get rid of that Noisy virginity, but I've only skipped it for space considerations. <br /> <br /> Should you see it? By all means. (Just compare it to the typical American movie about high school kids). For men, some of whom have never penetrated feminine mysticism, this may give you an idea of ​​what it looks like in the middle plane.
