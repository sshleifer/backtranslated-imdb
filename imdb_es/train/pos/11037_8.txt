['Now, I know it&#39;s unlikely that French prisoners have read Lovecraft (and that shows my point that their writings should be taught at school, maybe as a separate subject), but how did they think something that sounds like &quot;ftagn yog&quot; sototh &quot;could possibly lead to something good? <br /><br /> The film takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cellmates come across a magic book that can, if read well, remove them. As the prisons advance, the cell was totally unrealistic, which made it difficult for me to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves very slowly, which can bore people. But other than that, this is a first-rate horror feeling, mixing Sartre&#39;s &quot;hell is other people&quot; with a Lovecraft / Barker type of story, and quite successful. <br /><br /> In a few words: take the time to see this. That means not doing it when you&#39;re about to go to work or sleep or while doing something else. This is a movie that works best if you&#39;re immersed in it. Lessons to learn: Yog is bad, almost as bad as French women.']
