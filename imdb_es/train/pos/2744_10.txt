Remarkable and disturbing film about the brutal and meaningless real-life murder of a small-town family, along with the consequences, and an examination of the lives of the murderers, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith. <br /> <br /> No matter how long it takes, or how old-fashioned this movie is, the total incomprehensibility of criminal acts like this still resonates. <br /> <br /> This really traces multiple tragedies: the tragedy, the brutality and the folly of the murders of the Clutter family, a family of decent farmers in a small town in Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, brutal, and sad lives of Hickok and Smith. <br /> <br /> The film makes an interesting point: that none of these two immature, frightened, petty criminals had ever contemplated going through something like this alone But, together, they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality ; One that fed the needs and pathology of each of them. They push each other along a path of "proving" something to each other. That they were men enough to do it, to carry it out; none wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their great "score"; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led. These were two adult children, who live in the world of a criminal and do not recoil from the daring; That constantly needs to prove virility and hardness. in this case, these needs led to the murder of the Clutters. <br /> <br /> The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look to the Clutter family, but the point is clear. They were respected people, respectful of the law, of small towns, who did not deserve this terrifying destiny. The film also gives us an idea of ​​the young lives of Hickok and Smith. Perry Smith, whose early life was filled with security and love, but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path. Hickok, poor and went enough to his own devices, unable to see how it fit, using his intelligence and charm to swindle everyone he came in contact with. <br /> <br /> An interesting one, and perhaps the first one, looks at the death penalty, and what aims we hope to achieve. Is not this nothing more than a murder for revenge for a murder that shook a nation at a time when we had not yet faced that there could be such predators among us, or putting these guys at the end of a rope Does it really provide an impediment? To the childish and brutal stance of men like these? Is it possible to dissuade men who live lives of deception, operating under the radar, believing that they deceive everyone with whom they come into contact? To be dissuaded, you must believe that it is possible for you to be caught. Is it possible to dissuade these men who think they are too smart to be captured? Who has committed hundreds of misdemeanors and got away with it? This was supposed to be a "cinch", "there are no witnesses". <br /> <br /> When caught, Hickok discovers that he can not charm and defraud the agents in the way he had the employees of department stores. Smith, who believes he deserves that fate anyway, who seemed to be the only one who really understood the gravity of what they had done, tells the story willingly when he learns that Hickok has cowardly collapsed. Hickok blinked first. A silly chicken game between two immature, emotionally damaged and dangerous men. <br /> <br /> It's a fascinating psychological thriller that tells the story of a horrendous crime in the history of this nation. Impressive performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles made their careers.
