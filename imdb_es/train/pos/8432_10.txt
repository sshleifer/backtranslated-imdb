I did not read anything about the film before I saw it, by chance, last Saturday night. And then, as I watched him, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman in my bones. I was so captivated by the performance, the tone and the filming that I only partially listened to the dialogues. My husband fell asleep shortly after we went to bed and I was sleepless, under the impact of the movie. I wanted to wake him up just to say: "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the film on IMDb and I was sad to learn that Mr. Berry died before the film was released and that he had probably never seen the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell you that for me his film was a true independent film, in its concept and spirit. The actors should be praised not only for their brilliant interpretation, but also for accepting a part without brightness, not boasting, but quite the opposite, showing the true image of human depression. Sad but moving
