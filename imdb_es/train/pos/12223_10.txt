I saw True Crime when it first launched in the mid-nineties and I have seen it many times since then. It is a great mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school student in a city in California whose younger sister of her classmate was tortured and murdered by an unknown murderer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how brilliant she is and decides to work together to try to find the killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this. True Crime feels very "real" or real to me. I read a review of a newsgroup where someone wrote that the total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is very true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, as do the other actors. The location is correct and the writer / director, Pat Verducci, really captures some of the realities of adolescent life and Mary's loneliness (see the scene in which Mary awakens from the dream sequence after having seen the photos that took from Tony). I would like Verducci to make more movies. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other movie like True Crime. 10/10
