For the fans of the 70's horror films of Hammer, this movie should be a delight. The only thing I did not like about the movie was the fact that Peter Cushing was wasted in the worst episode. In general, however, this is a solid and spooky little movie. If this is not the best Amicus movie, it is certainly one of them. The best episode, just saved for the end, is the one that presents Jon Pertwee as a horror film actor: it's really excellent. As good as Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe that he has not done more of this kind of movies. In short, this is an entertaining movie, which scared me a lot when I was a child, and that still gives me the creeps.
