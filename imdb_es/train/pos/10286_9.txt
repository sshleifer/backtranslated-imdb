This movie is amazing! Although it is fun and entertaining, it is also deeply profound and revealing. I will see it again and again. Bruce is a boy who is not happy with his life. He has a job and a life, but it is not what he thinks he will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, dissatisfied and resentful that his life is not the way he sees it. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything he thinks is wrong in his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to obtain everything he has always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he imagined it would take to make him happy ... with one exception. In the process of winning everything, he loses the only person who really loved him. As the movie unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that should happen in his life was not the circumstance, but his perception of what was really there. This film was inspiring and profound. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a profoundly humiliating respect for the fact that many times we are much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, "since when does someone know what it takes to make them happy?" and my humble addition: "That we do not lose ourselves and those we care about while trying to discover it".
