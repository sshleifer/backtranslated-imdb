No award show can please all people. Clearly, if your favorite movies did not win, you will say that the program was not very good. It is understandable. <br /> <br /> However, the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for a magical moment in Hollywood history: <br /> <br /> The first appearance of Woody Allen at the Academy Awards . <Br /> <br /> Allen has often rejected the awards for being self-aggrandizing and useless, and has never attended, despite having won several of the most coveted awards. <br /> <br /> When the 74 Academy Awards were held, he said the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York. When it was time to pay tribute to the city of New York, they decided to show a video of the great cinematographic moments of the city of the cities. Then the announcer simply said: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, the director Woody Allen, winner of the Oscar Award". <br /> <br /> The place erupted in an extremely long ovation. The entertainment industry was finally able to give its applause to the New York Man, who generally avoids the Hollywood scene. When the applause subsided, Woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation. <br /> <br /> SOME HIGHLIGHTS: <br /> <br /> "Thank you very much, that makes up for the search for strippers." <br /> <br /> "I thought they wanted to recover their Oscars," he joked. "I was scared because the pawnshop had been out of business for a long time and I had no way of recovering anything." <br /> <br /> "But that was not it, I could not solve it because my film was not nominated for anything this year, then it hit me, maybe they were apologizing." <br /> <br /> Allen also revealed why he had overlooked his dislike of the Oscars throughout this special night. <br /> <br /> "For the city of New York, I would do anything, so I put on my tuxedo and I came here," Allen said. <br /> <br /> "It's a great movie city, it's been a great backdrop, exciting and exciting for the movies and it's still a great, big city." <br /> <br />
