The poor quality of the DVD video is the only reason why I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10. That could have been much better, this movie deserves it. <br /> <br /> This is truly a film that covers several subjects at once. If you do not like movies about serial killers, but you're fascinated by the amazing bureaucratic culture of the former Soviet Union, this movie is a must-see anyway. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to "Silence of the Lambs" for several reasons. The way the serial killer is depicted has done much better in Citizen X. You see several details of his private life, because he "travels" with the killer, which gives him an idea of ​​the source of his constant anger and Sexual frustration. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I've seen is as realistic as this one was "Henry, the portrait of a serial killer". If you were fascinated by that movie, you should definitely take a look at Citizen X.
