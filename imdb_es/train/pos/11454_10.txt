Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for a while, and owning some of his books, he had some expectations of what he would see. What I got was something completely satisfying, and a lot more than I expected. I myself am an artist (work in clay), it is imperative to find inspiration in our environment to make a good art, and it is something that Andy Goldsworthy has mastered. Following him over the course of a year, the director captures the spontaneous energy, skill and devotion to artists' connection to nature with an inspiring air. The music set in the film is comprehensive and intoxicating. If you are an artist who needs inspiration, or anyone else who needs an uplifting experience, then SEE THIS MOVIE. For my part, I'm glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there. Creating, dancing, fighting with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
