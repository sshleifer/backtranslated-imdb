['That hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It&#39;s funny on its own terms and quite funny too, unintentionally). Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, they&#39;re bad, too! One of them is given to the pinup postures and the salacious comments where it goes. The other rises to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has those sensual lips, slightly separated. And, so as not to give away anything, it is even more bad than the other. <br /><br /> The three sisters are played by starlets. The man who stumbles into their lives is played by John Bromfield. I had something of a career. <br /><br /> Today it seems that it is possibly the first conventional soft-core pornography commercialized. Well, of course it&#39;s not the first but the biggest one at that moment. <br /><br /> The girls dress as little as possible and let&#39;s not forget the members of the audience: it shows Bromfield shaving with an electric razor, whose was this fetish? - bare-chested He is also shown soaked in a bathing suit. <br /><br /> Here is also a real plot: the family of the girls, you see, is cursed. They are prone to suicide, or dramatic deaths that may seem suicidal. <br /><br /> The movie is not bad. I really do not know where it showed up. Maybe it was made for the drive-ins. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the main goal here. The women are sparsely dressed. They often resemble spooky covers of magazines like Police Detective or dime novels jackets. <br /><br /> But the boy seems to be the central focus. Not everyone in the movie likes it, but all the girls love it. And I think the audience is also destined to do so. <br /><br /> It&#39;s very funny, and on your own terms, too.']
