When your DVD was released I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was on the right track as I expected before buying it. Awesome movie What else can I say about Will Smith? He has been an incredible actor as always, whether in action movies or seriously. It always gives you a record braking performance. I think this is the movie after August Rush that makes a person cry while watching her. The way the director described the story was really impressive. His previous life and his new life in the film were drawn up correctly for the public. I could not even find any fault in the story or the way it was shot. I think your DVD should be a home because this will really be a good thing for your collection. It is not the movie that needs pop-corn to enjoy, this is the movie that allows the audience to learn a lesson. Now, what is the lesson you can see while watching? And I advise those people who are film critics, please see this if you can find any criticism about this film and then talk to me.
