Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi television series. <br /> <br /> There is no escape. How much you try to excuse yourself or explain it Stargate SG-1 is still a cheesy science fiction television series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 borrows and steals ideas energetically. The special effects are not as impressive as they could have been and the action will not leave you out of the chair. Or, on the couch too. <br /> <br /> But, and this is where I really believe that Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for every episode or idea stolen, I think it can count on at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that It is really worse than a one hour television episode. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes could actually have lasted 90 minutes and still have been better than most movies. <br /> <br /> And being able to maintain that quality throughout the show and keep on transmitting and pushing the story is what makes Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I am very demanding with my selections. Maybe I follow one or two television series and I have quite high standards, which surprised me even more when it surprised me. <br /> <br /> So for those who decide to brush off Stargate SG-1 yet. Another sci-fi show in bad taste, no. Keep up with that and you'll see what I'm talking about.
