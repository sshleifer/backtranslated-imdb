What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that it stops working? How can only a man get? When the mundane garbage we have to do to be part of society becomes too much, what happens? Frownland explores these questions. Without a doubt, a surprising original debut by Bronstein. The tone is strange and claustrophobic when we get into the mind of a guy named Keith who is so messy that he can barely form a proper sentence. We follow him when he tries to get in touch with people and the day-to-day function. Most of us have met people like this: people who say "I'm sorry" too much or "I appreciate it" when there's nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people like that, but why would anyone want to make a movie about them? Well, because it's interesting and Bronstein and the lead actor, Dore Mann, do an excellent job. This movie is as little commercial as a movie can get. A few friends filmed him over the course of a few years, as they saved money. It was filmed in 16 mm and the striped appearance of the film is very low budget. Without a distributor, this can be difficult to find, I think a random test has been done during the last year. Hopefully it will be on DVD at some point. I saw it in the silent cinema here in Los Angeles. There were 10 people in the audience, including Crispin Glover, if that tells you something about how rare this movie is. Highly recommended
