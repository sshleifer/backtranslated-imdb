(Some spoilers) I have not read the James M. Cain novel ("The Postman Always Rings Twice") on which this movie was based, so I can not compare it with this version of the movie, but I have seen and love the United States version of 1946. (also titled `Postman '). <br /> <br /> Even better is this gem of Italy, which, as I read, was "mutilated" in the edition due to too many flagrant references to the fascist regime. Well, does it matter? what remains is a good piece of cinema, apparently the precursor of the neorealist movement in the making of films. Can you see why? Despite how hard the edition was, there continued to be a generalized sense of society and culture, as well as personal oppression, which weighs heavily on the protagonists, who therefore face many limits in life. <br /> <br /> Consider Gino, the drifting young man, he is not well educated, he is unemployed, and he resorts to saving, stealing and swindling people to cope, his only pair of shoes is so worn that it is practically useless . <br /> <br /> At Giovanna, she sees an exit, however, she should have moved on, since Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage with an older man with some money, her job (working in the trattoria for her husband, enslaving behind the bar and in the kitchen), and her sex In the past, she had limited options, and decided to marry the owner of the restaurant / gas station (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) anyway, knowing that he would not make her happy. She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her. <br /> <br /> With the pretext of helping Bregana fix her car and send it to the village to buy a necessary part (which she has actually kept in her pocket), Gino wins Bregana's favor (also promising to repair the broken water pump that symbolizes life, or the lack of it) and stays alone with Giovanna. Immediately they begin a passionate and passionate love story. <br /> <br /> Gino soon feels stifled by the relationship and feels the need to move on when Giovanna proposes to get rid of her husband. Not wanting to participate, Gino leaves the city on a train trip that can not pay, kindly paid by him for another gypsy-type man named Spagnolo, a train mate. For Gino, Spagnolo represents a kind of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's moral and conscience), traveling and finding work at a carnival together. Finally, Gino has a stable job. To his dismay (he has not yet overcome his love for Giovanna), a month has passed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival and Bregana convinces Gino to return to his home and return to live and work with them, as he is very Useful. have around <br /> <br /> Too weak to resist, knowing that this will reunite Giovanna and him, Gino accepts and returns to stay with the couple. After a while, he surrenders to Gina's demands to get rid of her husband. Once the evil action takes place, Giovanna becomes colder than ever, seems to have very little conscience, while guilt and shame consume Gino for hurting a man who never hurt him. As much as he wants to leave her? He does it again briefly, now they are inextricably linked and must face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I liked the way in which the character of Spagnolo returned to the life of Gino to act as a judge of his crimes. That was very good and interesting, adding another dimension to the story. <br /> <br /> While the '46 version of the United States with Lana Turner and John Garfield is lost a bit in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially police and lawyers, Ossessione do well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of crime only in lovers. This gives the final result even more power and makes a powerful statement that reinforces the impotence inherent in the society in which the characters must live. <br /> <br /> A small objection: the amount of time (almost nothing) that passes before the eternal love is uttered by the lovers, how fast they kill the husband (there is not a failed first attempt as in the version of the United States); Is Gino's relationship with the dancer / enganchador very fast? They also quickly profess their love, and she is willing to risk a lot for a man she has just met! ?? all quite unrealistic, right? I found this time frame problem quite annoying? It made me think that I must have lost something somewhere. Otherwise, it's well worth the viewer's time. The acting and the direction were uniformly good at all times. Recommended.
