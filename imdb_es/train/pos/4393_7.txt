Ang Lee clearly likes to get into a movie, to capture the action, the characters and the staging, as they emerge. Cover the end of the random game of the American Civil War through the fortuitous actions of a young militia, without mentality or training, this is an ideal approach. The film is about the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the south half as a silent character, enduring the fight as a strong father. <br /> <br /> James Schamus's script is probably the standard-bearer of this movie; behind him there is a series of well-equipped performances that take him admirably. Only the name of Jeffrey Wright could take this movie to me. It is brilliant here, but in a paper that burns slowly: instead, we are treated with very good (if not revealing) performances of a large, often recognizable ensemble. <br /> <br /> A noble and optimistic film. One to see if you do not feel like the hardest, bittersweet, Cold Mountain or The Claim, for example. 7/10
