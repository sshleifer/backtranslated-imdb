An exciting adventure with director George Stevens (before resorting to more serious fees, such as the 1948 I REMEMBER MOM and GIGANTE 1956), which set the standard for all the action yarns to follow. Based loosely on Rudyard Kipling's poem of it, GUNGA DIN follows the journey of three military officers in nineteenth-century India. The noble trio must face a series of battles and other dangers, including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold. His adventures on the screen remain exciting even after more than six decades, and have lent inspiration to almost everything, from space opera STAR WARS (1977) inspired by cliffhanger to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). <br /> <However, the biggest reason for the success of the image is the perfect presentations of a trio of extremely charismatic actors of the film. Victor McLaglen has rarely been as good as the tough guy, Cary Grant is the best comedian, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is a hero as smooth as he imagined, maybe even more than his rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved, and that warm and credible attitude is precisely what is lacking in most modern action films, and they receive tremendous support from the wonderful Sam Jaffe, who overcomes the obvious physical and makes the title Character a beacon of human sweetness and quiet strength. A great success in his day (the movie was reportedly the second largest money maker of 1939 behind the overly successful GONE WITH THE WIND), and it's still arguably the best movie of its kind.
