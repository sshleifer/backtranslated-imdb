This is a movie that has many things that only the Japanese can understand. Even well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. I guess he tried to send a message of some kind, but that was wasted on me. <br /> <br /> What I felt is that it's basically a mediocre movie with nice special effects. Some child becomes "The only one" and in the end almost no relevance to a yokai war that does not make any sense anyway. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the washing of Azumi beans and the one that looks like a big tongue umbrella (Rihanna eats your heart!) I really could not discern the plot. <Br /> <br /> In a few words: nice images, the child screams a lot, the princess of the river is terribly cute and the rest is shit.
