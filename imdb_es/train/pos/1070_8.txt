The original Cindy of Jessica Alba Max and Valerie Rae Miller shines in this action and atmospheric series. Wonderfully politically incorrect. The quality varies greatly from one episode to another, but generally the standard is high and when it is not, it is always worth looking at Jessica. The African American movement of Valerie in American jade is sometimes almost dragging Dark Angel into the territory of comedies.
