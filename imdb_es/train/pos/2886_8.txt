Cinderella is a beautiful movie, with beautiful songs of course. In fact, it's one of the best movies of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters are represented in a surprising way. You can see the cruelty of the stepsisters of Cinderella and her stepmother, the sweetness of Cinderella. The mice are also fun and sweet. <br /> <br /> I think they changed the story a bit, but I think it's the best. It's such a beautiful movie, and I do not think anyone can resist it in the background. <br /> <br /> I give it an 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But surely it is a true classic.
