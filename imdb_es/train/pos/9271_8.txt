That's what one of the girls said at the end. <br /> <br /> Is the soccer game a metaphor for a classification game between girls (or more broadly, a free thinking group) and authority? "For Germany" means for a future that is hopeful? <br /> <br /> It's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experiences I've had, despite the raw cinematography and plot, and the slight overacting (although I like the cast) are friendly and far above the expectation for fans). The ridiculous situation is well captured. I can feel the deep frustration that is denied to a game (being a woman and a football fan) and I can not stop thinking about how to make a convincing costume. I wonder why there is not a section for women that can provide protection against dirty language and bad behavior, defeating the wrong reasons for denial. <br /> <br /> The film is very well made: the incredible title, the filming during the real game, the spontaneity and several methods to put the spectators in the place of the characters: the game is so important but inaccessible (not shown), the attractive light and the cheers of the stadium, the confinement of the van, and its uselessness when those inside are connected with the multitudes that celebrate outside. I can feel the comfort of radio, drinks and food and, of course, the kindness and consideration of each character towards others. During the final credits, I am amused that no character has a name, it is simply a "soldier" and she is any "girl" or "sister".
