Today I saw this movie, and I was surprised by the precision of the dialogue for the main characters. It did not feel like a movie, it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked the most). The main women in this movie seemed as real to me as the fifteen-year-old girls I know. <br /> <br /> In short, a very nice movie for those who enjoy independent films.
