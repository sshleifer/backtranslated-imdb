After too many years of waiting, the famous 1979 book by Anne Rivers Siddons, "The House Next Door", has finally been filmed. The result deviates a little from the novel that, especially in the first story of the trilogy, is understandable if it is unsatisfactory, since it is a television movie, which is absorbing and really very good, but not as good as the book , one of Stephen. King's favorites and one of mine too. <br /> <br /> With more execution time and fewer restrictions as a theatrical version, all the richness inherent in the original story of three parts of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured, especially the climactic revelation near the end. <br /> <br /> Even so, the whole cast does well in this careful story of senseless malevolence. There are some unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing atmosphere of fear is well developed. Actually, one of the most disturbing scenes consists of an abstract painting of the house made by his neighbor-amateur artist next door who is trying to visualize his corruption on the canvas. <br /> <br /> Be sure to read the great novel.
