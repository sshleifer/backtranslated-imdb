Whoever says that pokemon is stupid can die. This movie is superlative. I even shed a tear when Celebei died. I DO NOT CRY much! This movie is an exciting animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of pokemon, Ash and his friends must prevent the imbecile from making Celebei the best evil weapon with his dark ball. In time, Sam and Celebei travel through time and are continuously hunted by hunting hunters. I like the part with the double battle and Sam has the pokeball apricornio (if you played pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is). <br /> <br /> I also liked having miramax in charge. In place of the Warner brothers. Putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea. The pokemon in this movie come alive more than ever.
