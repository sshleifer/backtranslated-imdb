Just the things that dreams are made of is this search for the bronze ring by a naive scammer (JON VOIGT) and his lame companion (DUSTIN Hoffman), and then forge a friendship based on basic survival skills. <br /> <A daring film for its time, and an outstanding example of the type of sandy landscape that is explored in the most graphic films of the 60s. Symbolic of the "end of innocence" in American films, since it was the only X-rated film that won an Oscar for Best Picture. <br /> <br /> JON VOIGT is the male swindler who arrives in the big city waiting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight for his body, but soon discovers that the city is a cold place without a Welcome carpet for him. Friendship with a lame con artist (DUSTIN Hoffman), he goes through a series of serious comic adventures that leave him disappointed and bitter, ready to leave the limits of a cold water for the promised sunshine in Florida, a land that his friend "Ratzo" dream of living in. <br /> <br /> But even in this final search, the two are losers. John Schlesinger has delicately directed a brilliant script by Waldo Salt, and the disturbing theme "Midnight Cowboy" by John Barry adds to the poignant moments of search and despair. <br /> <br /> Summing up: a true American classic that honestly faces a difficult and daring theme to show the bottom of certain aspects of city life.
