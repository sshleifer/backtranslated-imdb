For me, a matter of life and death is just that, simply the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end oozes class. It is stimulating, stimulating, a mirror for the postwar world and relations between peoples. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolor to accentuate the different worlds works perfectly. The characters and the development of the plot are almost perfect and attention to detail promotes a completely believable fantasy. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you see the movie, and I've seen it a lot, you never stop playing it. I. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It's as recent today as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I were allowed just one movie to save and watch again, A Matter of Life and Death would be that movie.
