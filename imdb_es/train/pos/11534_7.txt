Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror chiller from 1990, released here in the United Kingdom with the label "New World Video". <br /> <br /> It's a horror movie based on the desert about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, only to be killed one by one by an unknown force that drives a black truck threatening! This movie has some spooky scenes, and some gore here and there, but I must say that the acting was so boring, even by low budget standards! But the movie was strangely addictive and I liked it, and I never slept or turned it off, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this movie 6/10, but when I saw that steam was accumulating on the road, I had some good moments of gore and suspense, I had some good nudity, and the fact that the blonde in the main role of the woman was also a hottie I will give it 7/10.
