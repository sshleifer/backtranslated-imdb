It's no wonder that Busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity, this movie is also a bad decision, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The first 5 minutes are the 5 most boring minutes of any movie; boring, bad dialouge, and then, with a Spiderman posture, Busey screams the best and worst line in any movie that has been created ... "your worst nightmare!" I coughed a bit of my eggnog laughing so hard. That line resonates so well that it even tops Clooney's infamous "hello freeze, I'm Batman" line. Another classic moment is that Busey is constantly annoyed by people who remind him that he killed his former CIA partner ... what he did when he accidentally shot him in the chest (all this is possible thanks to a super slow flashback sequence that makes seeing dry paint seem exciting). There is an ashtray for the nads, blows to the face and a "that was not my fault and you know it". Well, the images show that he misses the bad guy and hits his partner, so ... Another moment of shouting out loud has to be his ex-girlfriend who throws a grenade on the ground to allow his escape, a plan that defies everyone. Logical, physical and absurd. And finally, when McBain jumps out of the Thunderblast during an intense guerrilla war and starts running and throws a small object, I almost get wet. Some of Busey's best works by far, rent them or buy them today "thorn!" My vote is a perfect 10 (in the poo meter that is).
