I have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of the classic novel by H. G. Wells, "The War of the Worlds." Timothy Hines has finally done it! I could not believe how good it was! From the performance, to the costumes, the special effects out of this world, I can not say enough! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense, full of first class performances by a first-class cast. Must be seen to be believed. I sure did not. And I read all the negative comments of others, and I can not believe what they said. We must have been watching a different movie, huh? And those really bad comments of the vepsaian type, whoever he is, well, he just does not know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, sir. Hines
