In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced through three Warner Brother musicals that offered the Depression-era audience a momentary distraction from their problems. The Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were established in the world of Broadway theater and basically the same theme of the show must continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films featured Busby Berkeley's kaleidiscopic choreography, featuring melodies and many of the same support players. <br /> <br /> They are all possibly classics of their genre, but I must admit a clear preference for Emphasis for their energy rhythm and leads to James Cagney. Warren William at Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter at 42nd Street stand out admirably as the show's production bosses, especially Baxter like the burnt-out Julian Marsh in search of a last blockbuster. However, both lack the infectious energy of Cagney, who perfectly complements the frenetic pace of putting on a Broadway musical. It is an absolute whirlwind, as it deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a girlfriend digging for gold. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cagney just does not make Footlight the classic that it is. The script crackles with some sharp double senses emitted by a cast of superlative support with Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell, who reduces everyone to the measure. The Busby Berkeley dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risky, made just in time before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34. Unfortunately, the thirty and beyond would never see a musical so rich with the verve and effrontery of Footlight . again. Gentleness and morality made sure of that.
