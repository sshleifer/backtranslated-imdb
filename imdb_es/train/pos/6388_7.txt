This is what I knew about "Atlantis" before I saw it: <br /> <br /> * - It is officially Disney's first animated science fiction adventure. I'm not sure how accurate that is (I like to knuckle) but it made me feel curious the first time I heard it described. <br /> <br /> * - The preview seemed, for the most part, very good. Evidently, it was also "too cryptic", according to some critics after the fact. <br /> <br /> * - Apparently, it did so badly that Disney said, "Fuck it, we're going to launch 'Spy Kids' again." <br /> <br /> So, with everything said, how is the movie? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I'm a fool for the animated fantasy that involves poignant music and rampant special effects anyway, but "Atlantis" does everything possible. It is a throwback to all the CGI candy shots in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", so much so that it is almost a show of the best of an effects animator. The characters may not be as memorable (except, perhaps, for the medical officer of the ship), and the plot is a little boring, but this is not a movie that is seen for the plot. <br /> <br /> Here is a controversy that bothers me. The "failure" (as in, "only" took, like, five hundred million or something, I know animators who would kill to see fifteen dollars of that) of this movie compared to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." It has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation. I do not think that is true. How do you explain the "South Park" movie? What about "Final Fantasy"? Actually, history and art are everything, not the method. I do not know what the Disney movie will be like, but I still do not think they're out of the picture.
