The film seemed like a tour for the "Immoral Study". Most likely, I have never been very involved with the female artist's burning need to immortalize the male nudes and therefore all that fuss over "Who drew this penis?" It sounded a bit gratuitous. The dialogues in this movie are pretty terrible, although visually this movie had its moments. I almost understood it when Tassi started to paint a mental image, but then the film returned to the penis. Highly recommended for those who have not seen it in a long time.
