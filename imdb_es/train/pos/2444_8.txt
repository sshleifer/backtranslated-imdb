"GEORGE LÃ“PEZ", in my opinion, is an absolute classic of ABC! I have not seen all the episodes, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) entered a mobile machine. If you want to know why, you must have seen it for yourself. Before finishing this, I would like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the suits were well designed and the writing was always very solid. In conclusion, although you can now see new episodes, I strongly recommend that you catch them in case you get out of the air forever.
