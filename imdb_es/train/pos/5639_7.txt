I have read the other reviews and found some real-life comparisons of the film (for example, what is needed to enter the music school), Britney Bashing, etc., etc., so let's focus on the film and the message. <Br /> <br /> I rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range of 8 to 14, and for a family movie. For the average adult man ... 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock music, I'm 45 years old. I know Britney Spears but I never realized that she actually sang Stronger until I read Credits and these reviews. I did not recognize his poster on the wall, so I did not worry about any "personal promotion". <br /> <br /> I watch movies to entertain me. I do not care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the movie and what amuses me? <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie to see the message. The biggest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (which is a completely different story), so look with the message in mind, as it is an area of ​​interest. The film is light, bright and windy, ideal for children. I found that Texas twang began to fade throughout the film and, of course, there are so many ways to convey the message of giving up / not giving up, so it was a little predictable. However, the great message ... should be more of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family movie, but for a guy who sees it alone, get Hannibal.
