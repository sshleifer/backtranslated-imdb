This miracle of a movie is one of those movies that has a lasting long-term effect on you. I have read one or two reviews of angry people that I assume are Republicans or children who beat children, and their extremist comments speak of the power of films to confront people with their darkest secrets. None of those pieces of art has combined laughter and tears in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. You can not miss the realism of the film and its performance by Bret Carr. The very nature of its almost interactive effect will make people leave the theater freed or question their own identity. Bravo in the next level of cinema.
