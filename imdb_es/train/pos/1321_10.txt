Walk a path to this important documentary that seems an attractive feature. Forbidden Lie $ (2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of Norma Khouri's book, Forbidden Love, and ESO was a best seller. A lie of literary fraud and a pretty woman, Lie $ is the best in TV reality editorialized. <br /> <br /> Intelligently edited and colorful, Broinowski's narrative is divided into chapters moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri smoking smoke significantly. . I do not agree (with Variety) that it is too long; instead, my only problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on the newly recorded testimonies of others. In a single observation, your sense of narrative becomes submerged ... so I saw it twice. <br /> <br /> This effort worthy of an Oscar is at the same time truly fun, disturbing and totally absorbing, as it documents a lie. after another. The apparent conflict developed in the Australian state of Queensland through very personal scams of friends and fans of Khouri (!). Clearly, these friends are now "converted", the funniest line of the camera belonging to Rachel Richardson, Khouri's QLD, who expresses her disappointment in meaningless colloquialisms: "I think it's a load of shit! Personally." <Br /> <br /> We need to learn from their experience, hence my belief in spoilers. Any perennial liar caught in a lie will simply say anything to buy time and tell another lie. <br /> <br /> There are some impressive images of Khouri mockingly mockingly deceiving this same documentalist, who instead pressures his (her) "Artist" repeatedly to corroborate. <br /> <br /> Since being arrested by Sydney Morning Herald journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox, a year after the publication, Khouri has been fleeing, but he was tempted to return to the director to supposedly clean up his first name. She allegedly escaped because a) she is terrified by her shrewd husband, more Italian that sounds Greek, or b) because she needed her passport / visas to clear her name. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely. <br /> <br /> A more plausible reason was that the FBI recovered her trail in Queensland before she jumped again abroad (a guess: No, not Jordan). According to a closing letter, Khouri is "still under investigation by the FBI" in 2007. <br /> <br /> I assumed that the hearings could give Khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for the maximum secret and subterfuge. Instead, the audiences I sat with slowly became as disillusioned as the people deceived on the screen. Once they realized, there were many ridicule and ridicule; before, the stressed sighs had emanated from members of the audience who simply did not know how to take Khouri's evolving contradictions. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker receives the support to cover this convoluted story from start to finish, leaving nothing out. -not even his own sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna opens her film with the narrative of a nice book by Khouri herself. The reason stated for its authorship is recounted very credibly at the beginning: the key to how a liar works for life: in half-truths. Khouri is, however, a very handsome and intelligent young man of 35 years with a pretty disarming charm and, surprisingly, with resolute biceps. <br /> <br /> Gradually, we introduce ourselves to Australian newspapers, publishers and advertisers less and less sycophantic. the fanatics who at first bought the extent of Khouri's killing slaughter accusations hook, align and sink. Later, we see their sad reactions, quite self-controlled and objective, although some perhaps a bit bitter. <br /> <br /> It was the Jordanian (anti-) honor killers who were most offended. Khouri's fallacies due to their great commotion forced them to slow down the pace of change. Honor killings occur in Jordan; it is only its prevalence that is at variance with Khouri's book, plus another 72 "facts". In 2003, these activists faxed (Australian) Random House with 73 meticulously reviewed objections. <br /> <br /> The publishers of the 4 continents who had taken the opportunity to publish for the first time the author Khouri never tried to verify any. acts. Leaving any corroboration to a disclaimer in their author contract, they were also a fair game. So a massive fraud of burning issues was as easy to perpetrate in the world as writing it in cybercaf√©s. <br /> <br /> Later, we are still surprised to discover that "factual errors" extend to Khouri's biography as well. On the one hand, not only is she not a 35-year-old virgin (her defense is that she simply did not dissuade people from her assumptions), but she has a good husband and two teenagers. Sometimes he talks too fast with his American accent. She also seems too comfortable with cell phone technology and western clothes. I realize that observations like these may sound damaging to Jordanian women who do not need Western paternalism on my part, but when even cultural signals do not match Khouri's "facts", you must begin to question your source. . <br /> <br /> At some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion. She makes an admirable effort to hold Khouri accountable, in person, in Jordan. The last third is consumed in a research trip to Amman, where it falls one after the other. Finally, Broinowski forces his (with) "Artist" to admit the decade's discrepancy in his story, and it is after this that Khouri registers his mocking secret confession in his own digital camera. Secret, because in Khouri's "American security guard" you hear that Jeremy has an Australian accent: he's an actor! (We never discovered how Anna discovered it). <br /> <br /> So this becomes the triumph of the filmmaker, as it never marks her tone or commitment. His revelations in the camera lead his audience to learn from the mistakes made by other people, given the litany of reasonable doubts, the FBI documents and the most shocking initial crime of Khouri. <br /> <br /> Anna Broinowski (look at her now) is smart enough to use the only artistic device (the key players that comment on the images) to kill two birds, which makes her audience want to drink from it Well again. <br /> <br /> In fact, despite his deceptively demure approach, it made me re-confirm that Overington and Knox really won their 2004 Walkleys in Investigate Journalism for their "Norma Khouri Investigation". <br /> <br /> Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.
