['If this movie seems to you (as it is to us and, apparently, to others who leave the theater) that it is disappointingly thin, it may be that the subject itself is somewhat disappointing. The film faithfully presents Bettie Page as it probably was: an almost innocent playful from the rural south whose career as &quot;the pinup queen of the universe&quot; was simply funny and natural for her. His eventual moral repairs, religious conversion and the sudden deviation of the nude and the modeling of slavery are biographically accurate, but difficult to understand, given his concern for his sustenance. <br /><br /> There are even many reasons to see this film, among which is the incredible black and white photography of W. Mott Hopfel III (complete with wipes and old-fashioned solutions), the faithful performance of the 1950s under the direction of Mary Harron, perfect interpretations of some of our most underrated supporting actors (including Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak), not to mention the technically difficult main performance of Oscar de Gretchen Mol. <br /><br /> Ms. Mol makes several totally nude scenes and most of the others in incredible period lingerie and &quot;special&quot; costumes (gloriously assembled by costume designer John A. Dunn), however, surprisingly, it retains the unstudied pleasure of Bettie Page in her exuberant body. Seeing Ms. Mol as Ms. Page, an aspiring actress, progressing through progressively less &quot;bad&quot; audition degrees and scenes of student acting, is to see a truly excellent actress with complete control of her craft. <br /><br /> The script takes us to the United States of 1950, where child sexual abuse, kidnapping and lawless rape, and the legal suppression of pornography marks that today seem ridiculously tame, is a reality. The decade of the 50 in New York is evoked with a reel footage of perfectly cut news. Miami from the 50s comes alive in supersaturated colors in the style of 16 mm. The real page of Bettie seems to run, smile and pose before us, and yet the effect is curiously light, barely lewd and not at all dangerous. <br /><br /> How strange that the biggest icon of slavery lacks poison, and that this technically excellent biopic should have so little sting.']
