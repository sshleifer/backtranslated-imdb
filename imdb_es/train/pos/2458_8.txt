When I sat in the cinema I was in a good mood and I was not going to change it. But this movie is a dramatic power. I was all in sweat and needed a shower later. So, what do we have? In theory, the story of the maturity of a Turkish teenager living in Copenhagen, Denmark. I soon realized that the plot seemed to be completely taken from "Bend it like Beckham", where we had an Indian girl playing football and ruining her sister's wedding. Here we have it transferred to a Turkish girl who ruins her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. And we also have a love story and a competition, of course. After I accepted this, it really turned out to be an exciting and exciting drama and it shows some beautiful Kung Fu (although I'm not an expert). The main actress, Semra Turan, is not only the female champion of Denmark, but also offers an excellent performance, so it seems safe to assume that we have some autobiographical impressions here, considering that this is her first film and that she does not have education as an actress. The rest of the supporting cast is fine, the camera is good, intense Kung Fu. Side notes: - The male Turkish audience showed respect for what they should have done something right. - The audience erupted in applause when our heroine finally defended herself and attacked the boys who were badly beating their brother in revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese film instructor / actor from Kung Fu (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) played the lead role master. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this in the cinema, you probably have a good and intense experience and I do not know if this also works on a small screen
