The playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) has had a series of plays on the flop after a great success. Receive a work written by a student of yours, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), which is fantastic. It's so good that Sidney says he would kill for that. Is it him? <br /> <br /> The thriller of a thinking man. It was originally a work ... and it shows. It's mostly on a set and everything speaks but I never got bored. It is very well written, with many twists and a good cast that works with all its strength. Caine is simply great as Bruhl, another of his great performances. Reeve is, surprisingly, very good. I never thought much about him as an actor, but he's really good at this role. Dyan Cannon does wonders with a secured role as Bruhls' wife. Irene Worth is also good (and quite funny) as Helga ten Drop, a psychic. However, his accent got on his nerves. The director Sidney Lumet does it very well with his only set. The camera is always moving and keeps your attention going. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER right in front !!!!! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this film become angry sociopaths and also contain one of the most unromantic kisses I've ever seen, but these are minor complaints. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and it seems to have completely disappeared since it was released in 1982. That's very bad, it deserves better.
