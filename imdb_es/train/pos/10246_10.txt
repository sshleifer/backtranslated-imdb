['This movie has to be my favorite of all time. I&#39;m not supposed to have a plot, because its creators wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to believe it was a real snuff film. This was a visual effects exercise, and it is not cut when the action happens like the other movies do. Movies these days now have to do with sound effects, letting images be made with computers because it is easier to deal with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can not make the fake blood look like the real thing. There is no rape scene because that was not the point of making the film. Have you seen the hills have eyes 2? The rape scene was funny instead of shocking. Although I&#39;m sure there are some GONZO porn filmmakers who have tried to marry porn with horror. But since they are likely to make movies, they probably could not make it. The movie &quot;Baise Moi&quot; has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie in general stinks. <br /><br /> It&#39;s a shame that you can not make a movie without thinking about the monetary aspect of all this, especially when talking about an AO or NC-17 rating. I&#39;m sure Eli Roth has the ability and the talent to make his Hostel movie series much better, but he has too much restraint to get an R rating ... or at least I expect his films to get stuck due to these limitations . <br /><br /> Watch Traces of Death or More than Smashed Pumpkins if you want real footage without frills (scenes / scenes of accidents and crimes). Do not forget that this movie was made in 1985. The fact that this film can still withstand most of the nonsense that is made these days says a lot about this movie. It would be like someone said that 8-bit Super Mario Brothers suck because the PS3 has better graphics.']
