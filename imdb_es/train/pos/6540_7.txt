To be honest, I had to go see this movie backwards, I did not expect much, but hey, they did not cheat me, I had a good time. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film is a cool Breeze way, despite some data that tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but this reminded me of these youth films of the 60s and 70s of Europe and Quebec, where they get children to interact with adults. In this case, a 16 year old teenager tries to do justice trying to solve a mystery related to the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. Anyway, since his father had business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a mystery behind the doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. A bit like the chubby kid, who at first is naive to support his sister's jokes to Nancy, but in the end, he found Nancy cool enough to stay with her, even with her affairs ... <br /> < The rest of the cast is great, and I was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook in a different role this time: a single mother (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time, she plays a mature woman ... ) Anyway, don Do not leave this, it's fun!
