"Birth of the Beatles", for being a film of television of the United States, released in the autumn of 1979, in fact has been, until now, the best film that tells the story of the four boys of Liverpool that revolutionized the music industry and the world. As said by the point of view of former Beatle Pete Best. The performance of the entire cast is excellent but, especially, the performance of Stephen Mackenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by a legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr. Dick Clark. Who a year before, in 1978, had produced another film for television, which has passed the test of time starring "Kurt Rusell" in the main role of another musical legend; "ELVIS." That film was directed by an unknown director named "John Carpenter", who directed other successful films such as; "Halloween", "Escape From New York" and "The Thing". The same can be said of the director of "The Birth of the Beatles", Mr. Richard Marquand. He continued directing other blockbusters such as "Star Wars Return of the Jedi", "Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge" among many. The only other film that tells the story of the Four Fabulous I know is Back Beat, which had a theatrical premiere in 1994. However, the critics did not care, nor the audience, as it did not have a long useful life in the theater. Birth of the Beatles is a very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggles and difficulties that went through and end at the pinnacle of success when they arrive in New York and appear on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964 . I highly recommend this movie.
