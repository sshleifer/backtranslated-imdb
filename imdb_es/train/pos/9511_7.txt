A bloody history of gangsters that takes place in the years of the Great Depression. He tells us about another famous hit man, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, this time the story turns upside down: Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed due to the foul play of his own boss. He succeeds in his revenge and ensures an honorable future for his son, but in the end he is killed. Such stories never have a happy ending, after all. <br /> <br /> The role of Mike Salliwan senior was played wonderfully by Tom Hanks, and the role of Mr. Rooney (the mafia boss) was played by Paul Newman. The movie makes a big impression and we hear the well-known phrase "we rob banks". It is still worth watching this movie, although I could have expected something bigger from Sam Mendes after his American Beauty.
