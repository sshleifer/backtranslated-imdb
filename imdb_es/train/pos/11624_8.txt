Red Eyes, a movie the ID had wanted to see for a while ... Cillian Murphy plays Jack Ripner (Jack the Ripper), a managerial attitude for the Assassins, and his literally killer plan to hit a highly skilled man and his family. <Br /> <br /> An everyday woman "Lisa" (I think) is a normal woman, she goes to work, to her home ... she worries ... she hates flying. <br /> <br /> The death of her grandmother sends her on a flight that took several times. <br /> <br /> a flight in which she meets Jack ... a boy of ordinary appearance, until he gently reveals his profession and his plans, which casually include her in them, she is the key to death of Keefe (sp?). <br /> <br /> She manages to save them ... but she almost takes the cost of her life, Jack is beaten ... the Keef are saved ... oh, what a story * laughs * is a joke, the movie is really good, the best of last year ... there are small things that you should pay attention to earlier in the movie that give the film a GREAT importance later on. .. (Frankenstein's pen) I w I tried it several times before catching all the little jokes and whims ... <br /> <br /> a must see for thriller fans, not sexual, but there is a slight track (the bathroom scene) (jack) "Thanks for the quicky" and the (female attendant) "Ohhh ... it's going to be ONE of those flights" (second female assistant) "Hey! This is not a motel" you have the idea ...
