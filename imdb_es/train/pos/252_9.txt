The performances were magnificent, the costumes provided a unique feeling for the period and as a Victorian historian, I was impressed by the precision of the weaponry and the attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I would not say you need anything. The knowledge of the Kelly saga to continue with the flow of this film, but to understand the events and attitudes of the time, will require some basic historical knowledge. Do not wait, as some dumb people do, that any of the characters have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during childhood. <br /> <br /> Well, the story had some fictional elements, but these are necessary for a broader follow-up of the movie. Gregor Jordan said in the additional feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to "inspire interest," and that's exactly what happened to me, so this movie is here. <br /> <br /> See it and you will not regret it
