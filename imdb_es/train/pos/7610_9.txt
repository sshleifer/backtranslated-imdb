I've only seen season 1 so far, but this is just great !! A great variety of people trapped on an island. Nobody is who they seem to be and everyone seems to have many skeletons in their closets ... it seems that Melrose Place is with the Crusoe family and why is it so cool? Probably not, but then add a spoon full of X Files, a dose of "what"? and a great "hey" and an island that is everything you always dreamed of, in your most extravagant nightmares and in which you will be lost. The story has so many twists and turns that it's amazing. Great configuration, solid performance with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the whole world is human (well, almost everyone ... I think ...) with good and bad sides. But weird, oh, so weird ...
