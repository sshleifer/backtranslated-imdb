Opening credits: great. Music: just for this movie. Cinematography: poor quality to great effect. <br /> <br /> Exciting excitement in a kind of train crash. This is how some lives may be out of control. "The Land of Wonders" describes the wild nature induced by drugs (and its consequences) not as an aberration, but shows how it really happens in our society. It is better than the representations of another wild group -Manson's- because all the movies, books, etc. Manson's focus is on both Manson's demented mind and the general image of cheap fame and randomness that is so widespread today. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "acting methods" in the movie, look at Kilmer in this movie. Show how "The method" can be fascinating in the right paper. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers here manage to elevate "out of control" to the level of an art form, not just for the sake of giving us cheap thrills.
