In my opinion, this is one of the best action movies of the seventies. Not only does it have a great cast, but it is also loaded with shootings and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is about a Vietnam veteran (Kris Kristofferson) who was recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Kris starts to take advantage of his position and becomes so Bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of. It's great to see Kris play against the guy. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows a true movie star in this movie. I do not think Vigilante Force is on video, but occasionally it appears on television. It's a great movie for guys who like movies.
