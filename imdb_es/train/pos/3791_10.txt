Our song is a wonderful example of the creation of passionate films in their best aesthetics. It is, in fact, a true wonder of a movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young girls in the city (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their close adulthood will force each of them to make a series of difficulties. altering the choices that will likely redefine who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to relate to each other in the coming years. <br /> <br /> The writing / direction of Jim McKay is elegant and uncomplicated. There is no boring, gratuitous sentimentality or clich√© solutions in this movie. What we see here seems, at times, to be truly heartbreaking. There is a naturalism, a credibility, if you wish, in Our Song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit for the spirit of the film goes to its main actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful. It would be easy, and, of course, blatantly obtuse, to discard, as some apparently do, the performances of these three as apathetic or non-emotional. In fact, throughout the film, its silent charm, its instinctive sense of dignity and its crude, sometimes unconventional, intelligence are absolutely fascinating. One would have to be completely "out of touch" with, or completely indifferent to the behavior of adolescents to miss the authenticity of what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Similarly, the cast of support, particularly Marlene Forte as the mother of Lanisha, complements the work of the three girls, as well as the overall tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is a movie that should not be missed, nobody can see it. of any age.
