A nice short Shirely Temple. The child actors who shouted their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Maybe being "seen and not heard" needed to be compensated. Apart from that, this is fun. Given the time of the movies, there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social point of view, that I find very progressive and liberal. I will not go into them here, I would prefer not to spoil it for you, but let you see it for yourself and see if you see those elements. As soon as it was easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for Temple. That makes it worth seeing if you're a fan of the Temple. For others, it's a cool way to kill ten minutes while waiting for your good night's milk glass to heat up on the stove.
