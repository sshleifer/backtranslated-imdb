I think this film has a lot to recommend, especially a particularly sinister performance by David Morse and a more than acceptable performance from the always worthy to see Mr. Foxx. Although there are many holes in the plot and the motivation is very, very difficult to follow in some cases, in general, it is a good time in front of the tube.
