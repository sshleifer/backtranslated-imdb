The "liberation" of John Boorman refers to four inhabitants of the suburbs of Atlanta who take a walk by the fast waters of the Cahulawassee? The river is about to disappear for the construction of a dam and the flooding of the last stretches of untamed land. <br /> <br /> The four friends emphasize different characters: a virile sports enthusiast who has never been insured in his life since there is no specific risk (Burt Reynolds); a passionate family man and a guitarist (Ronny Cox); an overweight single bail seller (Ned Beatty); and a calm and thoughtful married man with a son who loves to smoke his pipe (Jon Voight). <br /> <br /> What follows are the nightmarish explorations of men against the hostile violence of nature. It is also an ideal code. Of moral principle about civilized men who fall prey to the dark laws of the desert? <br /> <br /> Superbly filmed, this exciting adventure for adults certainly contains some really exciting scenes.
