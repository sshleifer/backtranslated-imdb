Congratulations to the writers of this film for creating an extremely attractive drama. The curious development of the character is indicative of a nuanced and well-educated writing team. The member of the audience can not help but help, but to feel that he (or she) must make heart-breaking emotional decisions that pit the brain against the libidinal. The viewer has the opportunity to develop the character by himself, although his predictions are rarely validated. <br /> <br /> The credit is also due to the filmmakers for giving life to the environment. The wood workshop becomes a unique person as the film develops, with its own features, flaws, a variety of highly charged relationships and, of course, a destiny inexorably linked to that of the other directors. <br /> <br /> Make sure you catch this at your local art house.
