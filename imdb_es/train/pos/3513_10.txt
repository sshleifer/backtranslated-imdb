The actor Herman Jos√© plays the soccer role of a football entrepreneur who acquires the pass of two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of Benfica (club of his heart), FC Porto, therefore, these players He did not play well, and he wanted the FC port to be hurt with this. But what happens is that these two players, after all, are good and FC Porto sells them for a lot of money to a foreign club, doing good business. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without great background in big movies, is a very good and funny comedy, which shows all the rivalry that exists between the North / South of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
