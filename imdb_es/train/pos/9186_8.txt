['The disturbed photographer of the men&#39;s magazine Adrien Wilde (well interpreted with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has horrible nightmares in which he brutally assassinates his models. When the beautiful ladies begin to appear real dead, Adrien worries that he can be the murderer. Writer / director William Byron Hillman tells the fascinating story at a steady pace, accumulates a reasonable amount of tension, offers some terribly effective moments of wild misogynist violence (a woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake placed on top of her his head classifies as the culminating point that produces the definitive twisting), puts a refreshing emphasis on the well-drawn and attractive realistic characters, more thoroughly all in a plausible everyday world, and finishes off things with a good sample of tasty feminine nudity. The good acting of an excellent cast helps a lot: Joanna Pettet is a sunny and charming lover, Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adrien&#39;s macho, BJ&#39;s double brother amputated, Seymour Cassel as Adrien&#39;s psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter as Adrien&#39;s fighter. gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as the homicide detective sergeant, Cleavon Little as police chief, and Misty Rowe as the sweet and bubbly model Bambi. The polished cinematography of R. Michael Stringer makes an impressive occasional use of impressive panoramic aerial shots. The sinister score of Jack Goga&#39;s rattle also works. Robert Tessier is an abrupt bartender, Sally Kirkland as a spicy prostitute, Kathy Shower as a fierce fighter with whom BJ deals in the ring, and Frances Bay in one of her roles as an old woman. A solid and pleasant image.']
