The Theory Of Flight is an interesting character study of an artist (Branagh) who yearns to be free of boredom and mediocrity, and a terminal patient (Bonham-Carter) in the later stages of ASL, confined to a wheelchair, who wishes to make a man love before he dies. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham-Carter exudes wit, challenge and independence as an ASL patient who is virtually dependent on the people around her to take care of her. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh, convicted through community service to take part in his care, complements Helena's charm with a sad melancholy, creating a sentimental and compelling love story in which two people try to help each other mutually to find the way to happiness, before time runs out. .
