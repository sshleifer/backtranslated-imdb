"Secret of the Lens" is perhaps one of my favorite favorites of all time. The best and funniest of Kajawari Yoshiaki, who is known for the splattered anime and the lively hentai-ecchi of poor quality. I wish I could do more camping like this. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the CG psychedelic sequence, the parts where Lord Helumis blows up his failed henchmen, the party riots that Bill causes (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever he appears My favorite character, Worsle appears. <br /> <br /> Check this. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for serious and sophisticated Anime fans!
