Well, first of all I would like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is part of a Tamil prayer and, in general terms, translates as "protect". Khakhee, on the other hand, refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> In addition, the Tamil film industry is quite full of purely commercial enterprises, any movie of Rajnikanth or Vijay would be a testimony to that statement. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack. Certainly, very impressive in the final scene, especially I love the ending (which is certainly unexpected!). Gore is too much sometimes, but this is certainly a great movie!
