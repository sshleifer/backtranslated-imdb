Four great stories by master Robert Bloch, adapted to the screen by the best actors of the field in the early seventies, are the basis of this excellent Amicus production. This was a very popular type of movie in the sixties until the mid-seventies and it's one of my favorite horror movies. This particular shines for the episode Sweet to Sweet, where Christopher Lee is harassed by his evil little girl, heiress of his mother's tradition. A great fun from start to finish, and from good to very good are also the other three episodes (with the last one a bit funny, but with the great incorporation of Ingrid Pitt, the most famous vampire of English cinema.
