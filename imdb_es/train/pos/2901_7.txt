Tiempo de Valientes fits perfectly into the Buddy Action movie genre, but transcends its roots thanks to an excellent casting, a great relationship between its leads and an excellent picture. Diego Peretti plays Dr. Silverstein, a psychiatrist assigned to the shotgun with Detective DÃ­az (Luis Luque), who was assigned to investigate the murder of two small hoods that appear to have been involved in a conspiracy to smuggle weapons. Diaz has been suspended from service, but is the best man for work and must have professional psychiatric help to be reinstated. Silverstein and Diaz soon become entangled in a conspiracy that involves Argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows Silverstein to develop some impressive detective skills. Peretti and Luque are excellent together and they remind me of the screen crew Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti is not as classic as Hill. Surprisingly, even with almost two hours of duration, Brave Time does not wear out, and in fact, the writer and director Damian Szifron establishes a possible sequel in the charming coda of the film. In short, a wonderful action comedy and very entertaining that does not satisfy the lowest common denominator or insult your intelligence.
