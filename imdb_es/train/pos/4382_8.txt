Overshadowed by "Braveheart" released the same year, the two costume dramas ask for comparison. I admit my bias against Mel Gibson, but I maintain a rational preference for "Rob Roy". Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" convincingly represent the history of the Scots in a bloody and romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic hymn for individual honor and courage and a fantasy of revenge. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Consider your use of slow motion filming cornball. Their violence is both ugly and glorious. It is this latter quality that makes her more attractive to the adolescent mentality. While "Braveheart" surpasses "Rob Roy" in absolute levels of carnage (not to mention its indulgent execution time), this last film is, ultimately, more mature and satisfying. Its action is more discreet, but more surprising and intelligent. His sex is less flashy, but more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better romantic interest realized. His dialogue tries to approximate the poetry of the time. Their rotten teeth in the mouth of the actors try to approach the dentistry of the time. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. It is also recommended: "El Ãºltimo mohicano" and "El patriota". The latter may look more like "Braveheart" with its emphasis on bloodlust, with the previous one more similar to "Rob Roy" in tone. All the aforementioned films deserve their R ratings for violence.
