['Here is a story of revenge for the bad guys, starring an implacable and tough Denzel Washington. Here he has three personalities: an exaggerated and drunken former mercenary, then a loving person from father to a girl and then a brutal maniac in search of answers and revenge. <br /><br /> The story is about Washington hired to be the bodyguard of a small American girl who lives in Mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the movie). , Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington pursues those responsible and spares no one. Beware: this movie is not for the apprehensive. <br /><br /> It&#39;s about making movies with style, what is good and bad. I liked it, but many people found it too frantic for their tastes, since the camera work could cause a headache. I thought it fit the tense story and it was fascinating to watch, but it&#39;s not for everyone (the camera shaking). <br /><br /> In addition to the two stars, there is the always interesting Christopher Walken, in an uncharacteristic role, and a number of other excellent actors. <br /><br /> The movie satisfies the basic emotions of all of us, but it works.']
