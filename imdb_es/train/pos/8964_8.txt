By some happy coincidence the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak did the masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock's VÃ­ctigo, they also did this light comedy. Maybe the two actors needed to do it after suffering the heaviness of the Hitchcock movie. In any case, this is a great piece of company for "Vertigo", as it explores again an unlikely but powerful romance. In fact, the film can be seen as the other side of "Vertigo" with its happy ending. Here, again, Novak undergoes a transformation, in Vertigo he essentially plays two women and here he "transforms" from witch to mortal. Stewart is again enchanted and for a time tormented by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, the two come together in "Bell Book and Candle", a perfect antidote to the movie Hitcock. Again, the dynamics of love and attraction are examined, but in a totally different way. The cast is excellent. Lemmon is very funny as the brother of Novak Warlock and Elsa Lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt. Ernie Kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and, of course, Hermoine Gingold playing the Novak competitor are great. The scene with Stewart drinking the potion is comedy at its best. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if he has not seen it should see this memorable light comedy.
