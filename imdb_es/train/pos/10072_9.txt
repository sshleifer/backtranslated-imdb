['An unexpected pleasure since I had not heard anything about this movie. <br /><br /> Shameful because it justifies having a wider audience. <br /><br /> A wonderfully human story with a softly told social message, although it is certainly predictable in its resolution. Solidly acted by the principals. Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against the gray that captures the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /><br /> My recent foray into Chinese cinema (Shower, The Road Home, Not One Less) has been exciting and I hope to continue exploring. China and its people is an incredible canvas for filmmakers. &quot;The king of masks&quot; can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone interested in the recent Chinese movie. <br /><br />']
