I saw this movie a few years ago and I have to say that I really love it. Jason Patric was perfect for this strange role he played. Director? I do not have many things about him ... and I do not. It matters to me. The script is good, that's for sure. In a few words I have to say about this movie that is weird, strange, even dark, but it's good. I saw her a few years ago and I've never seen her since. I want to see it again and again. I know I'm not going to get tired of seeing it. The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story ... everything is good. The movie should have lasted longer. . I think 120 minutes should have been perfect. I was expecting a part 2 for this movie. Very bad, it did not happen. Jason Patricio: you are the man! very good movie. the end. :-)
