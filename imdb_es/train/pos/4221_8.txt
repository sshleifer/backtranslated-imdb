I loved the episode, but I think there should be some quick reference to the secretary being punished for being an accomplice after the fact. Although I like it when an episode of Columbo has an unpredictable turn like this, its resolution should be part of the ending of the episode, along with the discovery of the killer. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point, Gordon, who plays a famous writer, makes some comments about being flattered by the famous lieutenant Columbo, making an allusion to the detective's real life fame as a crime solver. This is one of the best of many great Columbo payments.
