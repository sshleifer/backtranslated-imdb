I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I liked the movie so much. Two days before the premiere of the movie I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie and I thought I had everything planned ... I was wrong: instead of a good movie, I attended an excellent one! I felt the movie. it was sad ... it was funny ... but, above all, LOVE appears ... I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack ... so no :) I'm not a film critic ... I can not 'I describe it with more words ... My somewhat vague description is all because the work left me speechless ... thank God for the keyboard :) Thanks Tudor Giurgiu, thanks Maria Popistasu, thanks Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Bis! :)
