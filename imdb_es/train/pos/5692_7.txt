This is the second film based on the life and times of the ultra-hung porn star, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also based approximately on his life. Maybe someday someone will make a movie about the life of Tommy Byron. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not very well told. There are many episodes of Law and Order that have more twists and turns than Wonderland, and the director never makes the criminal case develop with enthusiasm. Val Kilmer has two problems: he is not as hung up as Holmes (and this time there is no prosthesis, unlike Boogie Nights), and he is much more handsome than Mope Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not present a single nice person among the cast. The racist and immature life with which he is related, or his wife, and the police are not characterized by their characterization. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is that Eric Bogosian tells Paris Hilton to "get lost". <br /> <br /> Having said all that, anyone interested in the most sordid side of the porn business in the 1980s or the real crime should not be lost.
