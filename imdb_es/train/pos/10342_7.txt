Melvyn Douglas, once again, offers a polished performance in which, this time, he plays the role of a detective who can not place love before duty and adventure, and the warmly beautiful Joan Blondell (who, far from being illiterate, as one critic suggested, he wrote a novel about his early life) is as pleasant as ever, like his long-suffering girlfriend. It's almost an amazing comedy, almost a Thin Man type movie, almost a series, I suppose, that was not enough for a sequel. It does not reach the classic state, but it has all the ingredients for an 85-minute diversion with an episodic but peaceful script, good character actors and a direction that keeps it fast enough that you almost do not realize that Williams ( Douglas) is not exactly Columbo when it comes to detecting. I wish there were more movies like this one.
