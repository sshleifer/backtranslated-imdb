I admit, the first time I saw Even Cowgirls Get the Blues did not seem very memorable in any way. But now, after seeing it for the seventh time, I admit that it has grown a lot in me. The characters of Sissy, Mrs. Jellybean and the Countess have become very attractive. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think the satirical humor makes up for it. Then there's the kick-ass soundtrack that features the tremendously talented K.D. Lang (who reminds me a bit of Patsy Cline) at his best. I can not think of any movie that has "grown on me" after an unfavorable first impression, as much as Cowgirls.
