I hate to read reviews that say something like: 'Do not waste your time, this movie stinks on the ice'. For that critic, for me still, may have some kind of naive charm. If you like the other films in the 'Whistler' series, it will be visible. If you like 40's noirish movies, it will be visible. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good, in my opinion, as any of the previous entries in the series starring Richard Dix as a protagonist. It's much slower, and the plot is trite. You have seen this same narrative device used in many other movies, and it is generally better. <br /> <br /> But the acting is good, and so is the lighting and the dialogue. It just lacks energy and is likely to discover exactly what is happening and how everything will turn out in the end no more than a quarter of the way. <br /> <br /> The 'Whistler' series is semi-noir, and there the character, the mood, the lighting, the movement of the camera and the angles are more important than the story itself. But this movie is not black. It's too light and Hollywood innocent for that. Neither the character of Richard Dix nor that of any of his ladies in the previous films had to reach a good ending. You just never knew until the end. <br /> <br /> But still, I will recommend this at least once. I have seen it at least twice, and I have enjoyed a reasonable amount of both times.
