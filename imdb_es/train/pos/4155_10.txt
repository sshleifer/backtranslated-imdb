What a shocking episode for this good series. This is the excellence of television at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully shot in black and white, almost a black film style with its deep shadows and raw images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I do not want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in the United States. Written by the superb Tom Pettit and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their mutual love and their tragedy. Assuming such a delicate subject makes this episode even more surprising. Our emotions are as torn and nervous as the characters. The chills ran down my spine at the end when they played the pretty Bob Dylan, "Oh, but I was much older then, now I'm younger than that," as the Byrds sing. This goes beyond a 10 and all the way to the stars. Beautiful.
