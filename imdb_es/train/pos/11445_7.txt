A new way to enjoy the work of Goldsworthy, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see their work on the move. Seeing Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for each stone, blade and thorn he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspire and affect his work. Although I was happy that the film covered most of Goldsworthy's pieces (without snowballs), I think it was a bit long. The filmmakers did a wonderful job in bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and they created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.
