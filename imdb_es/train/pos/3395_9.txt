This is a brilliant science fiction movie that is very strange in the way men and women watch the same movie. I've talked to a lot of people about the movie and almost all the men loved it and said it was great, while most of the women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know that has such polarized views based on the genre. Maybe many women only have a lower tolerance to the disgusting or depressing plots, but whatever the cause, I have always found this difference fascinating. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a murder and a subsequent investigation led by Charlton Heston. . This is established in the near future and the head of the huge Soylent International Corporation has been killed. As the movie unfolds, he quickly realizes that this is a terrible and highly inequitable future American society. The rich live in beautiful apartments with security and all the pleasures that money can buy (including "furniture", a euphemism for the paid lovers that come with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are very poor, unemployed and in many cases live in abandoned cars or apartment corridors. The overpopulation and the smog have had a high cost and the future looks really horrible! <br /> <br /> Why the rich man died and the terrible truth that he could not live with, should NOT argue, could ruin the movie for you. However, the film has a great plot and performance and it is super exciting to watch. In addition, he has Edward G. Robinson in his performance on the final screen as Heston's crusty companion. Although it is not for people who are easily depressed or apprehensive, this is a great science fiction movie that is allegorical and profound.
