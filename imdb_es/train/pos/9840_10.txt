Born again the Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a man could return from the dead <br /> <br /> And live in the head of a girl <br /> <br /> Revenge that he would get <br /> <br /> For the murder he met <br /> <br /> For the guy who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me, Born Again is a highly underrated classic. episode that is part of what The X-Files defined for me before I started watching it. I saw some segments before the first time the show appeared and I was too young to see it, as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I remember specifically seeing this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely scared by the scene. where the boy drowns in the bus and then the scene of hypnosis with the girl. I tell you that I could not sleep for weeks! For this reason, the episode has a special aura about the chilling factor that I have enjoyed since then. It's enough to let me see some of the obvious flaws in the plot, for example, why the girl had to wait until she was 9 years old before her former life spirit really started demanding her revenge. Or what I was doing randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. One would think that his parents had been worried. And maybe they were, we just do not see that part of the story. And was it with telekinesis? Apart from adding the really cool Carrie factor to the already creepy story, there really was not any kind of good explanation for it. But even with its small flaws, in my opinion this is a classic episode and has little or no reason why I do not like it. 10 out of 10
