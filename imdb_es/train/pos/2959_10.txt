It was a Saturday night and a movie called BASEketball was on television. I always wanted to see it but I never saw it when I was in the cinema. Boy was wrong Words can not describe how funny this movie is, starring the creators of South Park, who share a natural chemistry on the screen when they are fun. I recorded the replay the next day and exactly one week after seeing it for the first time, I've seen it 7 times! I'm obsessed with that, and I know anyone who appreciates the work of Trey and Matts who will appreciate this movie. A MUST SEE, THIS IS MY COMEDY # 1 OF ALL TIMES
