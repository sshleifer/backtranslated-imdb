This movie is exactly what its title describes: an attempt to get it to buy what the writers have to offer. <br /> <br /> First, it's kind of funny to see the 1996-style Toronto that I remember with all its silly haircuts, sunglasses, clothes, and attitude. Nothing really has changed; It's just a quiet, safe, cheap and provincial small urban place that makes an ideal meeting place for international movie types! It's also fun to see Kenny and Spenny go to Los Angeles and discover that it's Toronto again, only with a strange variety of beach bums, musicians, fortune tellers and even more types of luxury movies. <br /> <br /> I do not see Pitch as a movie to enjoy it; It is not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching the aspirations of someone being trampled. I take Pitch as a warning that power and money are really owned by studio executives and production houses. Aspiring writers, musicians and actors (and "successful") remain mere transients, even when they reach the Big Time. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
