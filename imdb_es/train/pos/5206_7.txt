This film Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain contains very little thought or effort. He is ridiculed with ultra-fast "slasher" death specifications and simply repugnant acts of death. The performance was rated with a D since the actors show very little skill, and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable. The way they portrayed how people of their ages act was incredibly different. The strange division of pornography fits into the thought and does not really offer much, and any area that is respectable, but that quickly runs out with an absolute and heartbreaking death. Example is the poor man who is disembowelled from his anus, and the scene lasts about 5 minutes. It is terribly obvious how little children struggle. This movie is a good option for someone who likes to see some terrible deaths and practically torture.
