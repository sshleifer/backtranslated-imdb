The film was unsatisfactory, but this television pilot offers a great springboard to what has become an ideal program for science fiction fans. The delivery of actors and special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Having an interesting smart script does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite shows.
