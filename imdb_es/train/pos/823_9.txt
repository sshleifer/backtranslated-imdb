['Until the sixth and final episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always considered this 1983 entry as my favorite movie of the long series. The varied action scenes and the really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry forest creatures, etc.) made this a particularly attractive film. <br /><br /> None of the actions focused too much on one place, either. The last half hour is an example of this, as the scene changes every few minutes from the forest to the battle between the spacecraft to the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /><br /> Another nice feature that this film had that the previous two was not the absence of internal fights between two of the stars. No more fights between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was good to see it. <br /><br /> In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure story, more than anything else.']
