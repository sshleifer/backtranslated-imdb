['This could be the second best WWE PPV of the year after Wrestlemania, it was a good surprise! John Cena had an excellent game in which he annoyed Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his IC title in a sloppy game with Willam Regal. Bubba and Spike Dudley won a very violent table game over Benoit and Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a very good game with Kidman, which surprised me. Booker T defeated The Big Show in a no-dq game, at one point Booker T kicked Big Show and sent it straight across the table. In a stupid decision by WWE Christian and Lance Storm, the jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with much help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had the game of the night where it was full of good high places and RVD was able to retain its ic title through a DQ, so I was glad to get the title. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means little or nothing. And in the main event, Rock became the first WWE world champion seven times in the loss of Kurt Angle and Undertaker in a triple threat game. Overall, this is probably the second best PPV in WWE 2002. 7/10']
