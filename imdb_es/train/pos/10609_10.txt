I saw this movie last night on cable and it's extraordinary. What I like most about this is that it is discreet and discreet, but deeply sincere. The interpretation of Henry Thomas (played the child in E.T.) is masterfully inarticulate (he is supposed to be a man of few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain. And miraculously (since we're talking about a Hollywood product here), a baby is the main character, but it does not act or have lines, it just IS (and it's bright in that). It is interesting to note that the mysterious relationship of Thomas w. E.T. It was the core of that movie; while your link w. The baby is the core of "A Good Baby". <br /> <br /> Then there is the music: Ah, what music! The melodies of Gillian Welch are wonderful and the whole score is beautiful country music. <br /> <br /> This movie is wonderfully atmospheric. I highly recommend it.
