Here is a rare gem for those of you who have not seen or probably have not even heard of this. During the 80s, Dennis Quaid was a popular product, but in the early 90s, Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he returned to the big screen with three films, all unfortunately bombed. Two of those movies I liked a lot and they let me develop one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy movie about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), who are ... fire initiators: they do have the power of the pirokinetics. <br /> <br /> Wilder has decided not to use his power anymore (for anything that is not useful anyway) after a fatal incident during his youth, where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house that killed a man who was inside without knowing it. to them Today, Wilder is a fireman and is married to the crazy Vida (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest for, guess what, fire (watch the movie to understand it better). Wilder also has not talked to Wallace in 5 years, because Wallace set himself on fire during his bachelor party. <br /> <br /> Wallace loves his pyrotechnic power and uses it to have fun. He also runs a carnival and is the main clown. When the Carnival arrives in the town of Wilder, Wallace decides to meet with his brother and also see Vida, of whom Wallace has been in love. Vida's house arrest comes to an end, but Wilder is worried. Then, Wallace intervenes and the fun begins. Brother against brother ... fighting fire with fire! <br /> <br /> A big fireball throwing in this movie ... take your heart, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> The film also has some really strange, but fun, elements, like Wilder's fire unit sings acapella songs during gunfights and after rooms. Jim Varney (known worldwide as 'Ernest') appears as Wallace's carnival companion. "Wilder Napalm" is brilliantly filmed ... and cleverly prepared ... far from the wall and the avant-garde. <br /> <br /> Look at this ...
