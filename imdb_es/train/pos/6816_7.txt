['I discovered that this family movie is pleasant and pleasurable even if it is not a child. It is based on the concept of a high school girl, Susan (Elisha Cuthbert), who discovers that the elevator in her high-class apartment building turns into a time machine when a key from a keychain she got from a blind scientist is It turns into the elevator lock. . She learns to control the machine (with some uncertainty about the time of day). <br /><br /> The movie is not a serious science fiction work. You have to ignore the habitual instability associated with altering the past through time travel, that is, the past is changed to prevent the 1881 family from becoming poor, but the change means that the family never had financial problems, so Victoria would not. I told Susan about the financial problems her mother had, which means that Susan should not have had a reason to change the past in the first place! But aside from that, there are some nice details in the story, like the old elevator panel, which is in the apartment of the woman who invented and installed the time machine in secret, without having a space for the lock that activates the function of the time machine. . As in many stories for children, we must also assume that a child will not share surprising information about a time travel device with a parent or another adult, but will hide the traveler in time. <br /><br /> It also requires ignoring some poorly organized scenes and uninspired performances by some of the adult actors. (The children&#39;s actors (Elisha Cuthbert, Gabrielle Boni and Matthew Harbor) were all very convincing in their parts). In a scene in the 1300s, Native Americans noticed that Susan was watching and photographing them. But they do not register surprise in the sudden appearance of this blonde girl, of white skin and peculiar dress. Their response is to simply stop what they are doing and walk calmly towards Susan. In the same scene, an Indian mother carries what is supposed to be a baby, but obviously she is a doll (her white skin and head are turned around). <br /><br /> Timothy Busfield, the award-winning actor who originally came to fame in the old TV show &quot;Thirty Something&quot;, offers a somewhat uninteresting, sometimes apathetic performance. At the other extreme, Michel Perron takes him as the Italian construction superintendent (janitor), as does Richard Jutras in his role as nosy neighbor. (The name of the neighbor is Edward Ormondroyd, which is the name of the author of the novel on which the film is based). I suspect that these problems may be the fault of the director or a low budget. <br /><br /> Despite these shortcomings, I recommend the film for children. In addition to the interesting story, it also has some educational value, as it points out how much technology and social norms have changed in just over 100 years.']
