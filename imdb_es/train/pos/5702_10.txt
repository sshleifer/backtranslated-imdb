['I did not expect Val Kilmer to convince John Holmes, but I forgot that I was not the porn legend. In fact, the entire cast had incredible performances in this film so underestimated. <br /><br /> As some have mentioned previously, look for the set of two discs and watch first the documentary &quot;Wadd&quot;; It will give you a lot of background on the story that will be useful to appreciate the movie. <br /><br /> Some people seem dissatisfied with the video of the LAPD crime scene that is included in the DVD. There are several reasons why it could have been included, one of which is that John Holmes&#39; trial for the murders was the first in the United States where the prosecution used that information. If you do not want to see it, it&#39;s easy to avoid it; It is clearly identified as &quot;LAPD Crime Scene Footage&quot; in the menu!']
