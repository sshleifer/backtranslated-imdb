Man's Castle is located in one of those settlements built with jerry in vacant lots and parks that in these times were called 'Hoovervilles', in honor of our unfortunate 31st president, who was stuck with the Great Depression that occurred in his government . The proposal of this film is that a man's house is still his castle, even when it is only a hut in a Hooverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has a great hut and the truth is that this guy even in good times would not. be working so much But in a role very typical of Tracy before he was elected as a priest in San Francisco, the beginning of a lot of classic roles, is interpreting a fair and good nature that takes Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> One of the things about Man's Castle is that it shows the effects of Depression in both women and men. Women were given some additional strains, if men had trouble finding work, women had twice as hard. And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young who faces such problems and does not demand anything from her castle. Very soon, although they are in love, although Tracy is not the kind of people who settle down. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had something special for them because Tracy and Young had a torrid adventure during the filming of Man's Castillo. And both were Catholics and they were married and in those days it was an insurmountable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith very seriously. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast is Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau, who has overcome all the pitfalls that Young could find and tries to keep it clear and Arthur Hohl, a disgusting really disgusting that he also has his eyes on Young. Hohl takes the plot of Man's Castle to its climax through his machination. <br /> <br /> The Castle of Men is a grim look at the Great Depression, it is not the usual escapist of the film for those who try to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.
