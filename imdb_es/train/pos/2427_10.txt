This is really a great unknown movie. Perfect dialogue without the typical clichés. This film was based on the talent of the actor and was eliminated. I even had a bit of comedy, but I was not exaggerating. Once in life is what is supposed to be a criminal drama, not the typical special effect of garbage with sex. I especially loved the interracial aspects of all this. <br /> <br /> Now in the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was excellent in his career as a petty criminal. It's a pity that he is only allowed to show his talent in his own movie. Tito Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne's half-brother addict. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the perfectly flavored film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a lord of the fat / lord of drugs. I loved his performance from "King of New York". But the best performance in this film was that of Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were perfectly matched as two of Calderón's henchmen. <br /> <br /> Once in a lifetime, without a doubt, he is a goalkeeper. **** 1/2 * of *****.
