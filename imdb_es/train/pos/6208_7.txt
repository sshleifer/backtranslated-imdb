The independent low-profile drama of 1997, Henry Fool, apparently would have been a safe choice of movies that no one would bother to watch again for a sequel. A dissipated and wrinkled bum (Thomas Jay Ryan) walks towards the city. His delusions and his anarchist delusions inspire a nerd garbage collector (James Urbaniak) to write poems, while Henry tries not to attack the boy's sister (Parker Posey). As the poet prospers, Henry declines. Nothing special in any of the characters or in the story. A release for Harold and Maude's Ghost would have been cited more likely to reach a screen. <br /> <br /> But Parker Posey is not the semi-official queen of the Indies at all. "Then, when writer / director Hal Hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast, a movie was born. characters many years, they are in a completely different kind of dark comedy, this one is full of espionage! Henry may have been an international spy, and possibly a double agent, or even triple, for years before meeting the others. or hidden from agents and authorities of many countries.All want their incoherent and incoherent magazine that may contain coded secrets that could destabilize nations and economies.Fayy Posey is the wife left for the fight or his widow, depending on who is telling the truth, Fay's efforts to find Henry and / or the hotly contested magazines include a glove of globe-trotting people and multinational assassins at all times. She never knows who to believe or trust. Neither do we. <br /> <br /> As we gather these unlikely characters in the territory of Jason Bourne / Jack Ryan, Hartley's script retains the ironic humor of his first appearance, avoiding the slapstick by exposing them to physical threats. His astute lampoon of paranoia, duplicity and musical alliances of current geopolitics begins to crumble towards the end. Even so, fans of the first film will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of Hartley's recycling methods. (05/18/07)
