I saw this movie in a London movie theater in 1975 and I have not seen it since then. I found it hilarious. I loved its originality. It's rare that someone MAKES a movie like this, and it's also sad. <br /> <br /> What I want to say is that I once read a book called "The Black Hotel", and as a movie fan, I always "picture" books like movies. A little "adapt" to them, you know? But as I read it, I thought, well, this would be a great movie, but of course it would have to be "adapted", to the point where it would have little relation to the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, well WHY? Of course, it could never be seen on Sunday afternoon television, but whenever it was shown in the theaters to ADULTS, who knew what it contained, where is the HARM? Damn it, my civil liberties were being crushed here. A director MUST be able to perform a literal film adaptation of "The Black Hotel." <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, adult film censorship should not EXIST. But, unfortunately, although I accept that with INTELLIGENT adults, such freedom can be harmless, there will always be those who would lack the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality, and those who could be incited to commit crimes. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to see how "La Bete" falls into that category. <br /> <br /> In its appearance in England, the British censor discarded it. Despite the relaxation of the nakedness of 69, given the theoretical theme of bestiality of the film, if the censor had approved ANY, he would have been looking for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> BUT ... in On those days, there was an alternative. The G.L.C. This was a local town hall with a department that had the power to approve a movie just for London, where audiences were considered to be more "optimistic" than those who lived in clubs. <br /> <br /> The film was duly presented and PAST. However, it was later learned that the "board" consisted of only four people: three who voted, plus one "president". And that day, one of the voters was sick. In this way, the two remaining voters and the president sat down to watch "La Bete". <br /> <br /> One of those voters thought, like me, that the film was hilarious and that it probably would not encourage the bad actions of ANYONE. The other lacked imagination and simply thought that the piece was disgusting. And the president did not understand it, so he decided to make a mistake on the FREEDOM side. <br /> <br /> When the lost voter finally saw the movie, they also thought it was disgusting, but it was VERY LATE! The film had received its "X-London" certificate and opened to a mixed reaction. The G.L.C. Cinematographic censorship board was dissolved shortly after! Therefore, "La Bete" only opened in London for what could be called FLUKE. But I'm glad it was. It's great! If you have not seen it, do it. It's a FANTASY, and as such, it's much less disturbing than most things you see on the news these days ...
