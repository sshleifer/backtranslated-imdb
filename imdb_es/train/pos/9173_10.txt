I think this is a great version, I came here before, to help me find what version I should use and went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read a comment on user comments and then helped me get this version. I do not regret having chosen this version and neither do you. I tried to see all the other versions and none coincided with it. There's nothing like the book, and TRUST ME, if you're reading the book, you want something that matches it. When you look for something real and move after having read the book, it is difficult because you want something that matches that. I would say that God personally led me to this version. Aim for true love for a human. I would say that God's love is greater. If there is something better, I would like to see it. But until now there is none equal!
