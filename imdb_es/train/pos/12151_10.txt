This is simply the epitome of what a television movie should be. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in graduate school that we came across this. The cheesy performance. The badly written script. The good guys. The ridiculous, but somehow obvious, clich√©, and banal premise. Driving in vans with his wife's body supported. Has it all. <br /> <br /> You will meet familiar characters: the boy who is looking for gold, the rich and stupid boy who wants to go out alone, friends who know better, dad who knows better but who drives. son away And the woman-corpse. Supported In a pick-up. <br /> <br /> Wow: and the title. Several things in our lives have been "Texas Tragedies" since I observed this beauty. Everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal.
