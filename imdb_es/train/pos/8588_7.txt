It may not be the best movie of 2006, but it was just a movie to get excited and think. The Sentinel is a good political thriller that looks similar or even borrows some elements from other political thrillers such as In the Line. of fire and the Manchurian candidate. The basic plot of this film is similar to other films like this one: A plot to kill the president of the United States. Michael Douglas plays the Secret Service agent, Pete Garrison, who heads the operation and then discovers that it has been framed. Kiefer Sutherland co-stars as a kind of rival by the name of David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin, who is a rookie. the agent is under the guidance of Agent Breckinridge and Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine. An improvement for this film could have been more action, since some sources consider it as an action movie as a Thriller film, but the good thing about this movie is that instead of a murder plan to assassinate the President of the States United, it also refers to a mole (traitor) in the Secret Service who directs the President in the wrong direction.
