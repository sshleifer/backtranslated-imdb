The title sequence shows the credits written on a sidewalk drenched in the rain as people stepped on them; music is provided by someone whistling "Street Scene" by Alfred Newman. Then we find the Det. Sergeant Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man was not: a guy on the right side of the law. But it's pretty vicious for a good boy. After several complaints about his bad behavior, his boss, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon), degrades him. Foley tells him he is a good man, but he needs to agree and be more like Det. Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden), who just got a promotion. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in a splendidly thin performance) has an illegal dice game and is looking to make a trap. of the rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell), who was brought by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She realizes too late that her husband is using her as a decoy, and Paine hits her when she refuses to play. The gentleman Morrison intervenes, but Paine knocks him down. That seems to be the worst, but then it turns out that the guy is dead; and Paine seems guilty. <br /> <br /> But this will not be Paine's story. Soon Dixon has fallen in love with Morgan, but not before losing his temper again and committing a terrible fact that he tries to cover up. Morgan's father, a story cabbie (Tom Tully), can take the blame for it. It's up to Dixon to try to blame Scalise. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger directs an accredited script to Ben Hecht and three others from the novel "Night Cry" by William L. Stuart. This is a solid black cinema with excellent performances and all the shadow photography and the dark morality that we expect in this genre. It remains until the end brightly lit, which seems something that the studio had filmed to appease the censors. Of course, the black classic directed by Preminger and starring Andrews and Tierney is "Laura". You will enjoy this, but you can not miss it.
