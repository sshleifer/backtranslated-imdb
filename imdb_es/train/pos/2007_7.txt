My personal opinion is that this movie did not have a real story for the vampires of John's first carpenter, but I do not care. I loved. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. He really got mad at me, thinking that he was the person you would never think was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie. Like the story line, there should be more in the movie. There should be a continuation of the movie that followed the storyline of the movie and they should have kept the same main characters in the three vampire movies. I really liked the clothes that the people and the environment they chose in Mexico used. I liked how old Mexico was and not the new Mexico. With the mud houses and the old fashioned churches. I was a little confused with vampires and how they could walk in churches, but it was great that they did not follow the rules of Dracula's vampires.
