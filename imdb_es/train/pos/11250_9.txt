Having seen the mini A Perfect Spy series at once, you can not do anything but take off your hat: a pure masterpiece, which compared to the other miniatures of Le Carré on Smiley, has very different qualities. <br /> <br /> In the minis on Smiley, it's Alex Guiness, like Smiley, who steals the show; the rest of the actors only support it, you can say. <br /> <br /> Here is a set and a story that is important, as The main actor, played excellently by Peter Egan in the final episodes, is not charismatic at all. <br /> <br /> Egan plays a guy named Magnus Pym, who by lying, being cunning and telling people what they like to hear, is very dear to everyone, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner being is Alex, his Czech handler. <br /> <br /> The machinery behind a spy and / or traitor has never been better told! After having followed his life from a very early age, we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. His ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him "a perfect spy," as his Czech handler calls it. <br /> <br /> And, following your life, we fully understand how difficult it is to go back to the straight and narrow path, once you have diverted it. Continue, even if you never get anything economic, except the promotion by your MI5 spying teachers. Everyone is happy, as long as the flow of false information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus' father, played wonderfully by Ray McAnally, is a no-good scammer, who always dreams of schemes to swindle people with his money. In later years, it is his son who has to rescue him, again and again. But by the example set by his father and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison, and his mother is sent to an asylum, Magnus quickly discovers that lying is the way to survive, not telling the truth . At first, he overreaches a little, but quickly learns to tell the right lies and, to be consistent, does not change the stories from time to time that he tells those who want to hear about himself and his father. <br /> <br /> Your Czech manager Alex, played by Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help of Magnus, a network of non-existent informants, which provides false information to the British MI5 for years and years, just as the The German spies who were active in the United Kingdom before and during the war, continued to send false information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been converted, liquidated or simply replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> the young people who play Magnus in youth do it wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than the older ones, a little more cynical and tired, Pym, played by Egan. But buy the difference easily, since that is the way we change throughout life, from enthusiasm to pain or indifference. <br /> <br /> It's really worth the money!
