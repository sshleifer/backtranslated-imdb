May 2004, Wonderland is quite new in the United Kingdom. Brilliant movie of a brutal real story. If you have known LA since the early 1980s, you will appreciate how well it is captured. The use of the elements that make up his harsh cinematographic style is original, amplifies the experience and makes the viewer very close to actually being there. The use of a disconnected 'Pulp Fiction' style timeline allows one to explore the uncertainty about what really happened, while the direction and performances of the cast draw attention, especially to Val Kilmer as John Holmes; An Oscar sure if he distributed them.
