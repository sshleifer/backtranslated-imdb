I have not seen BSG, I tried to see it once in the middle of the program but I could not enter it. However, yesterday I saw Caprica Rebirth, I felt a bit lost, so I decided to see the pilot today and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising program and the only side effect it had on me is that now I also want to see BSG. <br /> <br /> But what I really liked is that I did not have to be a BSG fan to understand what is happening in Caprica. From what I have read on the web, they tried to reach the female population since BSG reached more men, and at least in my case it worked. <br /> <br /> However, I suggest that if you try to see the show do it from the beginning starting with the pilot.
