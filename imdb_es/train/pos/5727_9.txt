['Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student in Japan who is just starting to do some social work, is sent to help a semi-catatonic old woman, Emma (Grace Zabriskie), after her former caretaker, Yoko (Yoko Maki) ). disappears Karen soon finds out that something is not right in Emma&#39;s house and tries to &quot;see how deep the rabbit hole goes&quot;. <br /><br /> It may be a late influence of the success of the films of M. Night Shyamalan, but the slowest and underestimated horror films are a recent trend. In some cases, such as Hide and Seek (2005), the approach works remarkably well, and in others, such as White Noise (2005), the rhythm tends to kill the movie. I did not like The Grudge as much as Hide and Seek, but this is still a very good movie: I won 9 out of 10. <br /><br /> However, The Grudge has a couple of significant differences with respect to other recent examples of that trend. One, it is well known that this is a remake based on the series of Japanese films that started with Ju-On (2000) (in particular, it is extremely close to the first half of Ju-On: The Grudge, also known as Ju- On 3). , since 2003). Two, as with many Japanese horror films, the slower pace here is not so much in the realm of drama as in surrealism. As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror, The Grudge should look more like a filmed nightmare. <br /><br /> The director Takashi Shimizu, also director of the five Japanese entries in the Ju-On series to date (the fifth is currently in production), and the writer Stephen Susco have dispensed with linearity and are not too concerned about logic or Holes of the plot when it comes to the horror behind the story. The idea, however, is to present a sequence of dreamy scenes, with dream logic, where the focus is the atmosphere, the chilling, the strange, and for many viewers: fear. The way in which the film works for you will depend to a large extent on how you can adapt or be used to this different approach to making films (although it must be recognized that some of the apparent gaps are completed with previous entries in In the series). Traditionally, American audiences consider faults that leave hanging threads and abandon &quot;rules&quot; for the &quot;monster.&quot; A more poetic, metaphorical and surrealistic approach to the film is not yet accepted by the mainstream in the United States. <br /><br /> However, even if you&#39;re not used to it, it&#39;s worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about movies and give The Grudge a try. This is a well-written, well-directed, well-acted film, full of unusual properties, such as history intertwining a large number of &quot;main characters&quot; (which is better done here than the more episodic Ju-On 3), good cinematography. subtle touches of production design (check out Gellar&#39;s clothing, which matches the color and texture of the exterior of Emma&#39;s house, when Gellar first approached), and wonderfully effective horror material. <br /><br /> Although it is slower than your average horror movie of the past, the pace generally improves the restlessness, and there are plenty of strange events to keep terror fans entertained. The supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and, based on the interviews on the DVD with Shimizu, I have been urged to pay more attention to Japanese beliefs and folklore. Although the most interesting subtexts would probably emerge with a more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture, it is interesting to reflect on why so many Japanese horror films present children and adults who look like scary children. <br /><br /> I underscored a point for the movie to become slightly mystery / clich√© suspense territory with a flashback of &quot;this is what really happened&quot;, but even that was pretty well done, and otherwise, it would have been a 10 out of 10. <br /><br /> Now that I have said all of the above, let me finish with a mini-tirade: it is not that it is antireable, but it is ridiculous that US distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them. appropriate for consumption. The original versions of these films should be played in US theaters. UU It is not necessary to present an almost identical film, but simply to replace white American actors with non-white or foreign actors. Yes, The Grudge is a good movie, but ultimately, I prefer to see something original using this talent and be treated with the latest foreign horror films, not only Japanese, but also Indian, Spanish, Chinese, etc. in my multiplex With the hope that someone with some attraction in the studies reads this, it is also more profitable to do so, since (1) can completely avoid production costs, and simply make national distribution agreements from which you receive profits , and (2) you can earn money with fans like me, who would otherwise collect the DVDs of foreign films in versions made abroad or even in contraband.']
