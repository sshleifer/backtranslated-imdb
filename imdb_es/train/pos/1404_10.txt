HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror films of the last decade. The secondary plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I've seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon proves once again that he can handle any paper that comes his way. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains surprised the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933, well, Kevin Bacon has surprised * us * with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most exciting horror films in history. The action is intense and the chills are real. You may actually find yourself jumping if you see it in the dark on a stormy night. The cast includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. All of which do an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible. After tests on animals, they pass to tests on humans. But someone has to be the subject. Volunteer, Caine becomes invisible. But when his team can not regain visibility, Caine goes crazy for his condition while looking for his revenge ... * final spoilers * <br /> <br /> The film has created memorable crash sequences and is destined to become a classic until well into the next century. By becoming the basis of a fake joke in SCARY MOVIE 2, this movie grabs you by the throat and never lets you go. The first 45 minutes are more or less slow, develop the characters and show how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most fans of action and horror. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks into an invisible crazy madman. And then turn the water into fire and explosions. A rehash of a killer shark movie. Interesting ... THE HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
