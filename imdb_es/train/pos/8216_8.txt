*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two more or less exits ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), the dirty Harry seems to have recovered his step in "Sudden Impact", an exciting thriller He wisely plays to his strengths: the charisma of Clint Eastwood, who also directed, and a story that devotes enough time to the exhibition and reserves his energy for the big scenes. <br /> <br /> For once, the case takes Harry out of his native San Francisco (where he is again in trouble with his superiors for his "shoot first, ask after" tactics), the village of San Paul. There, (WARNING: possible spoiler), a woman who was raped in a gang years before, and whose sister has been in a catatonic state since the attack. /> <br /> The killer is played by Sondra Locke, and she makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold blood. Cold eyes and Locke's icy voice, when they try to console their hospitalized sister or take revenge on rapists, are very effective in painting the portrait of a battered woman whose years of suffering and anger are beginning to bear fruit. <Br /> <br /> The rapists are a despicable group, especially the leader, who has a "psychothermal exercise" practically stamped on his forehead, and a lesbian who seems to be one of the types, despite his anatomical inability to take part. The flashback scenes, while not explicitly graphic, are a nightmare and are clearly intended to make the audience applaud Jennifer while killing her attackers. <br /> <br /> Some will discard "Sudden Impact" as garbage: a mind without sense, Manipulation of the story of the revenge. On a certain level this is true, but it is a well-made garbage. What works in favor of the film is the strength of Sondra Locke's performance, which gives us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in his paintings than in his gestures or speeches. What we have here is an action movie with a point of view. <br /> <br /> You can take or leave the idea that some mistakes deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but as the mystery behind the murders becomes evident. For Harry (an understanding that, wisely, is not explained by dialogue), he is presented with an option: what to do about a murderer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is obliged by law not to tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than Dirty Harry's usual fare. <br /> <br /> The other redeeming quality of the film is the address of Eastwood. This is, after all, a dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. The film is directed with style and wit, and is edited to give the action scenes a great reward. Some of the best "Harry's moments" of the entire series are here, including Harry's best-known line, "Go ahead, make me the day." <br /> <br /> "Sudden Impact" is a film that has courage of its convictions when presenting a story about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a fascinating detective story, well done and well told. And it's certainly never boring. In those criteria, it has tremendous success.
