There is no relationship between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. The profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks classic. The profile graphics are quite simple. The plot of Fortier is much more complicated ... Fortier is more like Prime Suspect, if we have to see similarities ... The main character is weak and weird, but he has "clairvoyance". People like to compare, judge, evaluate. How about simply enjoy? The funny thing is that the people who write Fortier seem American, but, on the other hand, they argue that they prefer the American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and fun. The acting is not at all superficial ...
