Catscratch is the best you can get from Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show not only attracts Maoris and PI's. Some people love him, and they are all Australian. At first glance, I admit that it seems a little rough, but it grows enormously in you. Also, to correct something that one of the other reviewers has said: In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say "Does that mean you're a homo now?" he says "Does that mean you're homo, owww?" This is his phrase in the show. I think Mr. Blik is the funniest of all, like the Peww-Weww Playhouse. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must admit that the initial episode was a bit good. But after a while the episodes became great! And just when the series discovered that it's surreal, extravagant ... Nickelodeon cancels it! <br /> <br /> I know that Nick is for children, but every now and then there is a brilliant show that teenagers can enjoy. and adults. These programs include Mr. Bean the Animated Series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (sometimes) and Invader Zim. All of these must have been considered too good, with the exception of CatDog, because Nick felt the need to cancel them. <br /> <br /> What I like about the famous final episode, where Gordon is fighting a duck. <Br /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD, with a lot of audio comments and docos behind the scenes, and including the final episode. <br /> <br /> But of course, what I would definitely like to see if the show goes live. Wake up NICK! <br /> <br /> I wish there was a list somewhere on the Internet with all the closing credits. That would be great.
