A remarkable documentary piece, which gives a vivid representation of a country deeply divided within itself (for more evidence, check out some of the comments in IMDb ...!). It compares extremely favorably with Oliver Stone's "Commander" (which is primarily an in-depth examination of the hairs on Fidel Castro's nose). I do not know if Chávez is everything that presents himself, or another one in the long list of Latin American Latin American "caudillos". Nor do I know if he will be able to fulfill the great expectations that he has clearly created among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is not reasonable to expect that a film like this can answer such questions, but certainly now I have a pretty vivid idea of ​​what is at stake, and what it feels like to be caught in the middle of a coup d'etat. Someone says in the movie "we are making history", and that is exactly what the film feels that it is capturing. Outstanding things
