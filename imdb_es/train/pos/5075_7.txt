A well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending. Advantages: the way the story moves: it starts with Soorya struggling to live, followed by a long flashback about why it is there. Music. A disinterested look at the life of the police. Disadvantages: violence and blood, but I guess they add to the realistic effects. However, they could have avoided cutting off people's heads and sending them in boxes and sacks. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
