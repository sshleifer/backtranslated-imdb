Scott is right. The best duel of swords of 2 people ever filmed is at the center of this film. The fights of sword with multiple fighters are not the best, although they are quite good. However, the fight in between is the best even compared to the Japanese samurai movies. In my opinion, the Chinese scenes of games with swords have never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes in which a man must fight against a group of enemies, Japanese films are excellent, for example, the series Lone Wolf and Cub. Although duels in Japanese cinema last only a few seconds or a minute at most, the great intensity of those moments made them better. But, this is an example where the Chinese sword game surpasses the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this movie was a five-minute fight with the most incredible choreography in history. The other fights in this movie are also good, but even if they stink this movie I would get a 7 for that scene. If you have not seen it, you have to do it. John Woo is the man.
