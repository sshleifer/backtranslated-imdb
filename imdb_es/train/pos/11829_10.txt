I have been watching "Dick Tracy" for years and, as a result, it has become a vital part of my life; He was with me throughout childhood and I used to see it quite often. Seeing him now, as an adult, is still a very good movie: dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. Almost the only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination that Pacino received, apart from that, it is rarely discussed and did not make much of a scandal when it came out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is above ... above but with good results, since he is clearly having a lot of fun. Beatty is great as Dick Tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a black film comic better than any other movie, possibly, I've ever seen. Just taking a look at a scene in the film is impressive. The lighting, velvet tones and smoke / smoke combine to create a great effect. <br /> <br /> There are some really funny cameos, including one by Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles", and I do not think there are any flaws. In terms of performance, even mandatory child nature is much better than expected. <br /> <br /> In general, a really good movie that has been misinterpreted over the years since its launch and is incredibly underestimated with only 5.7. / 10 average in IMDb. Criticism from critics is very positive (visit RottenTomatoes.com) and after watching the film once again, it is not hard to see why: this is a perfect example of how to capture the essence of a comic, from style to art. eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
