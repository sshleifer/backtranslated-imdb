I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and I found myself completely entertained. First of all, it was clean, and I mean my standards. Most children's movies today are full of raw humor and jokes to provoke a cheap laugh from the pre-teen crowd. However, Nancy Drew is smarter than that, and the humor is subtle and intelligent. <br /> <br /> The title role is interpreted with a refreshing vivacity by Emma Roberts, who is cheerful and polite without becoming annoying. Unlike the Brady Bunch movie, where the anachronistic characters are mocked and ridiculed, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a big moment when the boutique owner fires off the "conscious of their style" girls in Los Angeles in their prostitute attire of Paris Hilton, while Nancy, with her loafers and her homemade Butterick dress, is embraced . This film rejects the tactic of the need to enlighten this healthy child that so many Hollywood films take. Nancy stays true to herself and her values ​​at all times. <br /> <br /> The mystery is sometimes tense enough to be attractive. There were several moments of suspense in which my daughter grabbed my arm nervously, but there were no free shock scenes. Everything is based on tension and state of mind and it is very fun. The cast is good, particularly Marshall Bell as the spooky caretaker. There are some great cameos by Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves better grades than some have given it. Not only was I glad I was not being dragged into another computer-animated movie where the talking animals erode and pass gas everywhere, but I also entertained myself a lot. If I had been there without a child, I would still have enjoyed the movie. This is a DVD that will have my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
