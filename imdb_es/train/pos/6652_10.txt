I saw the movie and I really could not stop crying. It is a tragedy that India does not have such leaders after freedom, that they dare to do justice to their own children, when they do not behave properly. In the current generation, politicians take their children to politics without measuring their caliber and abilities. I remember Gandhi's dialogue 'What kind of society do we want to create / do with these people (about Harilal)?' It is not surprising that it will be a dream that India does not have such a good leader in this or the next generation. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi that "After 50 years one could hardly believe that such a person has body, soul and mind" (Mahatma Gandhi) had ever lived on this earth. I sincerely want THANK YOU to Anil kapoor, Feroze khan and all the actors / movie actresses for this wonderful movie about the great person and the relationship with their son. All parents and children should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.
