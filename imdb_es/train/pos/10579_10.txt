The young and energetic producer of theatrical prologues (those theatrical performances, usually musical, which often came from the movie in the biggest cinemas of the past) must deal with crooked competition, fraudulent partners, infidel lovers and amateur talent to fulfill his dream of leaving his mark. in the FOOTLIGHT PARADE. <br /> <br /> Although it closely resembled other spectacular Warner musicals, in particular the GOLDDIGGER films, this film had a special attraction that none of the others had: Jimmy Cagney. It is a marvel, of loose and agile joints, as agile as any cat, a creature that actually imitates several times during the film. Cagney attracts the attention of the spectators and never abandons them, promoting the dialogue of rapid fire and the cheesy plot with its charisma and floating charm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also gives their best. Joan Blondell is perfect as the intelligent, big-hearted blonde secretary, in love with Cagney (important discussion: why did not they give her a musical number?). Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, once again, play lovers on stage and outside; the fact that his singing and acting skills are a bit lean is compensated for by his dancing; Powell still exudes youthful enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male leader. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee and Hugh Herbert are very funny as brothers-in-law, both plotting to cheat Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly scores as the wealthy wife of Kibbee, a woman dedicated to her handsome proteges. The harassed choreographer of Frank McHugh is an adequate complement to Cagney's wit. Herman Bing is hilarious in his little scene as a music arranger. Mavens will spot little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin and maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's Busby Berkeley, unparalleled choreographer. His terpsic√≥ricas confecciones, scattered throughout the decade of 1930, were a supreme example of the cinematographic escapismo that the hearings of the Depression wanted to enjoy. The big joke about Berkeley's creations, of course, was that they were meant, as part of the plot, to be theatrical productions. But no theater could ever hold these products of the teacher's imagination. They are perfect illustrations of the kind of entertainment that was only possible thanks to the film camera. <br /> <br /> Berkeley's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches, either a story (often quite odd) told with song & dance; or impressive geometrically designed numbers, goodies for the eye, with plenty of choir girls, camera work on top and a romantic melody. In a spasm of extravagant extravagance, FOOTLIGHT PARADE culminates with three Berkeley masterpieces: "Honeymoon Hotel" and its Preproduction Code that speaks of a couple's wedding night; `By A Waterfall ': dozens of naked females, splashing, floating and diving in perfect patterns and designs (look closely and you'll see how the synchronic effects were achieved); and finally, 'Shanghai Lil' - an appropriate tribute to the talents of Cagney and Berkeley.
