Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. A performance worthy of consideration for the Oscar, but once again rejected by the Academy. Mr. Grant runs the gamut of fools to tender in this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city. The pitfalls of building a house are well documented and became the basis (freely) of Tom Hanks' most modern vehicle, "The Money Pit". <br /> <br /> If you like good old fashioned comedy without the curse and Free Sex, this movie is a must.
