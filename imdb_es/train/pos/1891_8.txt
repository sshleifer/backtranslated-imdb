When you watch this movie, you begin to realize how drastically underused the late Dudley Moore was. There should be a dozen movies like this in our archive. <br /> <br /> I already had first class talent before going to Hollywood, both as a comedian and as a musician. But above all he is remembered for his partner with Peter Cook, on television and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of these was 'Bedazzled'. <br /> <br /> He always tended to be overshadowed by Cook, who, by his envy and pettiness, altered his association and allowed Moore to realize his true potential in the United States. 'Arthur' is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a truly splendid movie. Moore's clown comedy as a drunk is undeniable. The script adapts perfectly to their manners with many hilarious, almost surrealistic conversational digressions. There's something so British about him that, actually, I'm surprised he found such appeal to American tastes. Tommy Cooper, an anarchic comedian, in the same way tended to go blank. It is Moore's almost infantile vulnerability that is so endearing. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play a straight line against him, but still have excellent one-line phrases. John Guilgud, in particular, delivers his with a sarcastic and biting authority that is a treasure to watch. He invariably steals any scene in which he fully interprets and deserves his Oscar. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he has never played any other comic role. <br /> <br /> There is a follow-up movie called 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. It never reaches the same sublime levels of fun that it achieves, but it's still pretty good. Guilgud only has a cameo at the beginning and as a ghost. It's darker And there's an interesting soul search. You will be disappointed if you look first at 'Arthur'. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to lose interest in the cute Dudley after these two exits. Finally he returned to Britain, dejected and apparently dying. <br /> <br /> But 'Arthur' is a sample of what could have been. We can only imagine the other great movies that he should have done. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you've been lost, Dudley.
