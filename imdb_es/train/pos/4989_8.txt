This is very old-fashioned, but that's part of the charm of this 1933 movie. You can say the same for most of the Pre-Code films; they are simply different, and generally in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It was the short execution time, the great performance of Spencer Tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of the Loretta Young character that kept me watching and enjoying. this fascinating but fascinating movie. <br /> <br /> It would be hard to find a nicer girl than "Trinna", played by Young, 20, who was already willing to make her 50th movie! (She started acting like a little girl, that, and the fact that they made movies quickly in the old days.) The camera, although focused gently for much of the movie, focused on Loretta's face and eyes. times and fascinated by its beauty. <br /> <br /> Playing a crotch man with a cynical view of life, "Bill" de Tracy slowly transformed into a loving man, thanks to Trinna. Spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting. <br /> <br /> Although they have small roles, supporting actors Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions long after seeing this. 75 minute movie I was particularly fascinated by the role of Connolly as the figure of the minister / father of the camp. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit exaggerated but, hey, those are the movies. This story is about two lonely victims of the Great Depression who try to survive in a field of the type "Hooverville" and end up being a very moving story.
