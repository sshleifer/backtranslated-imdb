Lauren Bacall was living through the illness and death of her husband Humprey Bogarts when she made this movie. Rock Hudson was near the peak of her stardom in the 1950s. Dorothy Malone is in excellent shape and earns an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated and falls short for his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit soapy from another era but it's worth it like most dramas. It's amazing how well the drunks can lead in this movie and also how quickly Stack calms down in a couple of the first sequences. <br /> <br /> You can see why the cast is so good and the production really is very good. good. It can be said that Bacall is distracted during this film, because while his performance is good, he is emotionally exhausted in some sequences. <br /> <br /> The sexual references in this film are so slight that many of today's young viewers would not. realize what they are. The film does a good job telling a story and, in fact, leaves a sequel to be made at the end, although none was made, although Written Beyond THe Wind would be a good title.
