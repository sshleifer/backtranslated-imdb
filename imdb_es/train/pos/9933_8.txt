If you are in need of an escape, something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to get lost in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. This is entertainment, after all! The plot keeps your brain moving: one of those movies (like Usual Suspects) where you want to see it a second time to discover everything. I asked myself about Domino Harvey, how his life was of interest for Hollywood. As for acting, many celebrity appearances are not shown in the trailers. And any actor that makes me forget who has done their job well. Not once did I think of Kiera in a football uniform or pirate costume. And granted, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being able to care for other people.
