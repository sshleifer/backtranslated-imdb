['Of all the films that I have seen, and most of them, this is by far the best one that has been made, mainly on US naval aircrafts (Blimps). UU During the era of the Second World War. Yes, there are other good movies related to LTA, but most use special effects more than any shot in real time. This man&#39;s Armada has much more real-time footage of blimps, etc. It&#39;s true, there are many cheesy dialogues, but that&#39;s what makes Hollywood movies more interesting, even today. PS I spent 10 years (of 20) and I have more than 5,000 hours in naval aircrafts of all kinds, from 1949 to 1959. Proud member of the Naval Aircraft Association, etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]']
