The photography was beautiful, but I had trouble understanding what was happening ... was there much symbolism? ... the 2 golden fish: do they mean something in Thai culture? There is not much plot, it does not happen much and it simply meanders along. Without real beginning, without real means and without real end. quite unsatisfactory really. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to enter the characters because you never felt that you knew them ... it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real. The movement felt chaotic and disjointed. I do not know what the pang brothers hoped to achieve. Maybe if it were Thai it would make more sense ...
