It does not seem that this film has managed to please many people. First of all, not many seem to have seen it in the first place (I just stumbled upon it by accident), and then, judging by the reviews and the rating, of those who did it, they did not enjoy it very much. <br /> <br /> Well, I did it. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and his charm, and although I did not consider him a great actor, I know he can do a crazy thing quite well (I liked his Mr. Jones). But this performance is all different. It's not pretty in this one, and it's not charming. His character is completely different from everything he had seen of him until that moment: old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gere, in what for me is his best performance so far, does it wonderfully. I suppose it is a sign of how well an actor does his work if you can not imagine someone else doing it: think of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, or in Washington as Alonzo on Training Day. That's how good Gere was here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was good for me too. I guess I would not have chosen the Danes in this role, mainly because I think she's very good at it. But in reality he does an excellent job, supporting himself with a Gere in top form, which is not a small feat. Strickland easily delivers the best act of support, in a part that requires a considerable range of it. In fact, I think she has the key scene with Gere and Danes, and that's quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> So, what about the rest of the movie, apart from an excellent performance? Maybe the story is not very surprising, it has some aspects of 8 mm, but by adding the argument of "veteran breaks into novice" to who-dunnit, and also (like Silence of the Lambs) adding a sense of urgency when trying to save The girl and the imminent retirement of the character of Gere. All this is a backdrop for the development of the two main characters, as they help each other to settle in their respective new seasons in life. That's a lot to achieve in 100 minutes, but it's well done, and we end up taking care of the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The direction and the photography were adequate. I could have done it without the modern movements of the music video camera and the cut, but then I'm an old curmudgeon, and it really was not that bad, in fact I think it helped with the atmosphere of the movie, which, as you might have guessed, in general is not happy. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
