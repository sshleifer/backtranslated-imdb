['Because I read bad reviews and my friends told me they could not believe how bad it was, I did not go to see this movie at the movies. After watching it on DVD, I have to say that now I regret it. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s brilliant, but I would dare say it&#39;s a good movie. I loved it. <br /><br /> People have skulls thicker than Ned&#39;s helmet if they are going to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. If you read the real story behind most of the films based on historical figures, there is usually a big difference between the fact and the fictional portrait. I do not believe that Ganghis Kahn has ever been portrayed remotely close to the historical fact. The kind of man that Ned Kelly was really is a matter of debate, and he seems quite passionate. Despite the efforts of governments and some historians, Ned Kelly has become a legend. The legends are stories, and the stories say the same about those who tell and hear them as they do about the real figure. Ned Kelly has become such a popular identity because it represents that aspect of Australian culture that does not trust or accept authority. A society in which there is no disagreement or challenge to authority is more insane and more dangerous than any other fighter. <br /><br /> So I did not expect this to be an accurate re-creation of Kelly&#39;s historic gang, it actually seemed like a surprisingly free and unfettered movie. It was sentimental and romantic, but fortunately it was not as cheesy as it could have been; for my Australian compatriots, look at &#39;The Lighthorseman&#39; and see what I mean (it&#39;s a shame the story has been treated so badly). Maybe the business of the love story could have been abandoned for a little more detail in other areas, such as the shooting of the soldiers. Ironically, I really enjoyed the movie because of that, because it would be those details that would focus most of the focus on Ned&#39;s story. And it is the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different points of view given by different historians. <br /><br /> This film was always going to have difficulties, since it was committed to appealing to a global cinematographic market (to pay the pills) and to the legend as it means for the Australians; Maybe a little of Ned&#39;s spirit is in this movie, because I think he rebelled against the expectations of the people and, unfortunately, he missed both objectives. Fortunately, it was a nice whim of a movie. For me it was an unexpected movie about Ned, and that&#39;s why I liked it. The performance of Orlando Bloom also did a lot for the movie, it really added something. I think he would have liked to be the monster instead of the pretty elf, for a change. <br /><br /> When you consider some other movies that are much worse than this, you should reconsider your opinion about this movie. Send me this on DVD for Christmas instead of Croc Dundee or The Man From Snowy River at any time.']
