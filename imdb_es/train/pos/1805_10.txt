I just watched this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was 7 years old and I could almost remember the ending. So I saw it like, 10 minutes ago, and (I can look like a baby since I have 12 ha-ha) I started to cry at the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was sad for Anne-Marie mainly because she said: 'I love you, Charlie' and also: 'I'll miss you, Charlie', it just made me cry, ha ha. It has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie worth watching. Look at it, ha ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but, I love this movie, it's a true classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
