This is an excellent series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family cares for and helps each other through their crisis is a great example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things they do, and a series of bad decisions, but they never turn their backs on the family, they solve the problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the cutest thing I've ever seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers with the Middle Child Syndrome and with the help of EVERYONE in the family is better. DJ, the eldest daughter, is growing, whether her father wants it to happen or not. One thing that everyone shares is that they miss their mother. Danny (dad), Joey and Uncle Jesse love these kids so much, and it's evident in every episode.
