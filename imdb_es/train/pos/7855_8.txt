Tess of the Storm Country was a Mary Pickford vehicle that she intended to obtain for some time. Finally, I found a copy on VHS at a reasonable price and I was able to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her typical portrayed and innocent and sexy representation of a girl on the wrong side who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time the risks are greater: a charge for false murder, an illegitimate child (and the case of wrong motherhood) and contemplated suicide. <br /> <br /> One can see why Pickford wanted to remake this one. The story is a tale of real morality, the kind she loved to star in. Controversial issues are not always clearly explained; a viewer has to pay attention and collect suggestions to capture everything that is implicit in the first visualization? although everything is explained more or less at the end. <br /> <br /> The only negative observation I can make would be about Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, seems to be around 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger next to Mary, of course!), Is sent fleeing in panic when a 60-pound chocolate lab charges him! Then, to top it off (or perhaps to justify his disconcerting fear for the dog), he manages to immobilize him and, somehow, hurts him so much that he is still struggling to get up much later, as if he were hitting a strong storm! This is the same adorable lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and curls up with Mary! However, Mary then throws boiling water on Ben's face, which barely slows him down! Ok, I've relieved myself about Ben and the chocolate lab! Apart from that, the movie was quite moving and it certainly caught my attention. Pickford's supporting cast was strong and credible. This is undoubtedly one of his best films.
