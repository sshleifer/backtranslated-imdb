I remember that I was a kid when I saw this movie for the first time, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why I can still remember some parts of it). I do not remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things, but I do remember that a man has his head blown with a grenade, a man dismembered on a tree and a man hit by a truck and shot in the head :) ( Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister tore the assassin's stomach to get the keys to the truck. It's a movie that scares you and it's worth watching. But where do I find it? How can I download it?
