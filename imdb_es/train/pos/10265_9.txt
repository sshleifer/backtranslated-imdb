Unique film about the confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved with sharp scammers. Joe Mantegna offers an Oscar-like performance as the most skilled of the group. Absolutely delightful first hour, while Mantegna shows Crouse "the ropes" of his swindlers. The story line is revealed a little later, but it is still a unique portrait of an innocent caught in a dark world. It is definitely worth a shot.
