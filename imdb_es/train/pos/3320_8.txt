['I liked this movie, beautiful and fun. I found that this movie was a good family movie. The dirtiest part of this movie was when he made reference to the New York Yankees. You have to be in the nation of the Red Sox to understand that the New York Yankees are a bad word. I&#39;m sorry to say it to the Yankees fans. I recommend this photo for the whole family. moment in the movie, I&#39;m in love and what I do, but the movie makes up for it with all the slapstick moments. The film shows some moments of how the nation of the Red Sox (in Fenway Park) how The fans felt that some 86 years of the Sox were always wrong at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and love with another human They go hand in hand.']
