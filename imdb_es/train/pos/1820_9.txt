['I can remember this movie from when I was a child, I loved it at that time and I still do it. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and I was very happy because it had been very difficult to find it before and I had only rented it when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The movie is full of fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the voices of the characters are perfect. This movie has always been a game of tears for me, but I think that if I had not seen the film when I was little, then I would not find it as brilliant and fascinating as the one I have, although I still believe that I would still like it because I do. I&#39;m really into animated movies.']
