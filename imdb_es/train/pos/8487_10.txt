I remember seeing "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother and I wondered why I would always cry in the last minutes. To me, of course, I found the whole movie funny, especially the manners of the characters. It was not until I was much older and I saw it again when I realized how deep this program was. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in their roles as reluctant mediators. Keaton stops surprising me with his real style of line delivery, and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. I also thought that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was simply fabulous in her role of comic relief. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the most underrated movies of the 80s. We can all learn a lesson from the fusion of American and Japanese workers in this film ... sometimes you * really * can * have "the best of both worlds." And now I understand why my mother felt like she did in those final moments. I'd rather have one of those cars, too.
