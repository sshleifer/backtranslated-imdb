I guess if a movie has magic, I do not need it to be fluent or perfect. You can omit background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this movie: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley and Iris, but they do not detract from the overall positive impact of seeing people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the most difficult to correct. Both characters are intelligent. However, Stanley can not understand enough to function because he can not read; He can not read because he has had too many adventures in his childhood. Iris, although well educated, has not had enough adventure and, therefore, can not understand how to overcome the change of meaning that her life took. Both in their defects and in their strengths, the characters complement each other. It may be a bit difficult to accept that an Iris would end up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better paid job. And while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of history, their development seems somewhat artificial. I guess nobody took the time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a good movie. Imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on the screen if someone had done it!
