He took this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (although the director of the festival told me that it was one of the best films presented). Five minutes later they sold it to me. Filmed in B & W with a very small budget, this movie is hilarious. The acting is solid, the writing is solid and the appearance of the film is solid. Acting is probably the biggest revelation, since most of the films filmed with low budgets tend to have an amateur or stage performance. This not. It presents one of the most convincing, attractive and funny portraits of a character with the Tourette Syndrome that I have seen. The plot is convoluted without being confusing and lascivious, without being gratuitous. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (I hope he has done well) deserve the opportunity to show his stuff to a wider audience.
