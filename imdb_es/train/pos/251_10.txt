"If Ned Kelly had been born later, he probably would have won a Victoria Cross in Gallipolli." such was Ned's bravery. <br /> <br /> In Australia and especially in the country Victoria, the name Ned Kelly can be said and recognized immediately. In Greta is still a hero, the life of the blood of the city of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield still have not forgotten that the three policemen he 'murdered' came from there. <br /> <br /> Many of the buildings you visited in your life are still standing. From the old Melbourne prison where he was hanged, to the post office he kept in Jerilderie. A cell in which he was held in Greta is on display in Benella and the site of the Ann Jones Hotel, the station and even the records where he was captured in Glenrowan can be visited. <br /> <br /> Evidence of Everything The events in the film (except for their love interest) can be found throughout Victoria, in the police records and even in the Sash that Ned received for rescuing Dick Shelton to drown None of this is wrong, and what is left out would further justify the actions of Neds. The Horse that Ned "stole" was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man Ned boxed with after his release from prison). Ned was already in jail when it was reported that the horse was stolen, so he could not have stolen it. <br /> <br /> Jerilderie's Letter is more than what has been said before. It is not a self-justification, it is Ned's biography, a summary of what he defended and who he was protecting. So go ahead, read it, watch the movie and decide what Ned meant.
