['Very rarely one encounters an independent comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The writer&#39;s director not only tackled the challenge of directing his own work, but also offered a fun performance as an evil roommate. The script analyzes interestingly not only the difficult situation of the writer who fights, but mixes so much comedy in the desolate world of the writer that you can not help but commit yourself to Ernie as a character. Very funny things. Despite the small budget, Adam Jones manages to take a serious look at the film. He is not playing when it comes to making a good movie. I can not wait to see what happens next. This guy can make people laugh and think; that is special']
