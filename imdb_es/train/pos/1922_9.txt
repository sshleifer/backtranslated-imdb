Let me say first that this show was top-notch when John Ritter was there. After his death, the program dropped a bit, but the producers did not give up, adding James Garner and David Spade in the regular cast from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> The program centers around of the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, rest in peace), his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), his daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and his son, Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I would laugh out loud (and I'm proud to admit it, I am), but now that he's gone, I'll just laugh a little bit with some laugh. I am very happy to have fallen in love with the trance of this program after the untimely death of Ritter, because it made the eps with Ritter much better. <br /> <br /> The character of Ritter is so well acted and well rounded, that you can not help more than him. He is always sending the girls around the appointments, but he really wants them to be happy. He is the best dad who hates entertainment with a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also great, and she is also a nice character. After Ritter's death, her character provides great influence and strength not only for her children, but I believe that Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson and Spanjers, because she and Ritter had been friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> The funniest person on the show would have to be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the last blonde: beautiful, slow, silly, but she is an intelligent person. She is out of the hilarious wall with her innocent "blond" humor and how presumptuous she is. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson may be a bit annoying like Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only flaw in the program is that the program never gives Kerry anything to be happy about. She is always behind Bridget, and her character feels as if they had put him there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spanjers as Hennessy's only son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, it's mostly comic material. After Ritter's death, the program provides some story lines for Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner are nothing but laughter, with the occasional side story of C.J., the character of Spade. Garner plays Cate's father, as a bit of background information. <br /> <br /> In general, I give this show an excellent review because it is a great show that had a tragic event that paralyzed it. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 --spy
