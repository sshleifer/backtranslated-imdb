This film is essentially filmed in a handheld camera by the actors. Somehow, a mockumentary in other ways a killer video diary is full due to a "Columbine" style attack. While this movie does not answer all the big questions, it gives you an idea of ​​how easy it would be to get away with it. Through the film it is shown how the actors illegally shortened firearms, fabricated pipe bombs and created an action plan for "Day Zero". The actors (if you can call them that) were brilliant, they obviously took many loans from their own lives, but at no time did I actually detect them acting (Something that Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was great, but I'm not sure if we needed the last scene. In general, although a really good movie in a very difficult subject.
