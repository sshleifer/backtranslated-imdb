['The ScareCrow was one of the funniest killers I&#39;ve seen on the spot! Also, he&#39;s really bloated most of the time he jumped around, it was amazing! He also had an excellent voice, I mean it was just perfect for him. The story was excellent too. I like how the children&#39;s soul was transferred to ScareCrow which was great! Besides, he had a reason for all that murder, I mean after what those people did to him ... I would also be angry! The look of ScareCrows was really good! his look gives that person a &quot;my God!&quot; Reaction when they see it! What was great the looks he had were funny! Those people were stupid, who would be watching for so long! They should take a look and run for their lives ... although that would not have made a difference!']
