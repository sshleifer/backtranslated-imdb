... here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me say that I was surprised by this short film. I saw it, at random, when I was in Boston at a film festival and I've thanked God every day since then. Actually, I really think I was part of an event, like reading a Tarantino script before anything else or watching the first show of Mean Streets. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what festival the short film is about. or what the creative team has on hand for future products, but I hope to be there for it. <br /> <br /> Again, a truly incredible cinematographic piece.
