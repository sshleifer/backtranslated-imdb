In this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and presenter of nightly interviews, is captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette). On the (story) of this guy, however, Gabriel finds himself caught up in a growing mystery that hides a deadly secret - according to the movie's official synopsis. <br /> <br /> You really MUST LEAVE READ these comments and watch the movie NOW ... <br /> <br /> The "How did you lose your leg?" The end, with Mrs. Collette planning her new life, should be cut and sent to the land of "deleted scenes." It's an exaggeration The true nature of his physical and mental ailments should be obvious by the time Williams returns to New York Possibly, his blindness could be questioned, but a revelation could have been secured in the "freeway" scenes "or" video tape ". The film would benefit from a reissue: how about a "director's cut"? <br /> <br /> Williams and Bobby Cannavale (like Jess) do not seem, initially, credible as a couple. A scene or two that establish their relationship could have helped set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a "personification of homosexuals". Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe) and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are perfect. <br /> <br /> Best of all, Collette's "Donna" belongs to the spooky Hall of Fame. Ms. Oh is right in saying that Collette could be, "you know, like that kind of 'Psycho'." There have been several years in which organizations that awarded performance awards seemed to reach women, due to a smaller dispersion of roles; they certainly could have noticed Collette with some consideration of prize. She is so good. And, director Patrick Stettner definitely evokes Hitchcock, and even makes a sandwich from a vending machine a suspense. <br /> <br /> Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson deserve the gratitude of flight attendants everywhere. <Br /> <br /> ******* The night listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin
