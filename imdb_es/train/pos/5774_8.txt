A meteor falls from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that it used to terrorize the area around Crater Lake a long time ago. While the monster eats the locals, they try to find a monster. <br /> <br /> Recent attempts to send old horror and science fiction movies like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass become somewhat moot when you have movies like Crater Lake Monster available for screening. It's the kind of movie that those films falsify and send only this is the real deal. It's all those movies are trying to be just with their tongues on their cheeks and it's a lot more fun about that. This is a true drive-in movie that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as Star Wars changed the way we see special effects. The monster, a mix of stop motion and a life-size head, is a charming little beast. The filmmakers pamper the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its chaos. Of course, it is clear that everything is false, but are not movies a suspension of disbelief? In fact, I think it's really great monsters, that this has. <br /> <br /> I like this movie in a low budget unit in a way. If you want a real authentic album in the monster movie, look no further. This would be perfect for a double or triple function with similar lake monster movies (Boggy Creek, etc.)
