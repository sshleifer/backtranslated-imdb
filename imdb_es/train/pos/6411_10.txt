This is one of the best military movies ever made. And it's great because of its focus on values. It is a great story of human interest that is committed to honor, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro are excellent in the leading roles. It is wonderful to see that Master Chief racism evolves towards respect and love through determination, drive and, yes, the sense of honor of Carl Brashear. The title indicates the source of your link. I never realized until this last time that I saw how brilliant Carl Lumbly's representation of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was. In a way, it is a cornerstone of the film that is Carl's memory of his father which helps him overcome difficult moments. <br /> <br /> I am selective with regard to the movies I buy. This is one of those rare things I want on my bookshelf. It will be seen many times in the future, I am sure.
