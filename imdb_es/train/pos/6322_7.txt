This movie was recommended to me by a friend. I never saw an ad or a trailer, so I did not know Clooney was in it and I was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small. I thought the whole cast was adequate, and I found the movie quite nice, in general. The opening scene, with the small band of bandits standing on the side of the road, looking flogged and emaciated, caught my attention immediately. He had a way of telling you: "do not go, this will not be boring," and it really was not. It turned out to be an interesting and lively comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your seat until the end, but when the end came, I felt a bit cheated ... just a little. The events continued to develop, so you expect them to continue building, but at a point that I can not define, it levels out, which makes the ending a little disappointment. I admit that I expected a great climax, but it turned out to be a bit discreet. If you watch the movie with that in mind and can live without high doses of George Clooney, you should find this film very entertaining and worth seeing. Now I would like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it is probably a rare find in the United States.
