So I rented "Still Crazy" instead. When I described the Hardcore logo to the guy in the video store, he said it sounded like Still Crazy. So I rented it. Disappointed me? Well, yes, since Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band instead of a punk band, but that's fine. Still Crazy tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band that split in the 70s at the peak of its popularity at a great rock festival. Twenty years later, all the members of the band are struggling to make a living, and they are offered the opportunity to play a concert on the twentieth anniversary of this festival. They accept the offer and decide to reform it permanently, traveling through Europe in the process. Some pretty funny hijinks are produced, and all the characters go through subtle changes. When you watch this movie, you feel more like a spectator of a carefully edited documentary than a participant. And that is not bad at all.
