I did not expect the highest caliber cinema with Joel Schumacher directing this, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> In the art, it is often derived from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN with the camera's unstable work, grainy shots, the film occasionally runs as if it were jumping a cog --- all those techniques that Speilberg used to make his movie look more realistic, but in the end it distracted more than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike SALVAR A RYAN PRIVADO, the emotional component was not so weak, since the characters in this movie seemed more real people and the story less artificial, not so wrapped in the American flag ( Speilberg gets an 'F' in subtlety.) <br /> <br /> Next to the first section of Kubrick's COMPLETE METAL JACKET, this is the most realistic representation of the training camp I've seen in a movie, and that's why I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's not a bad movie either.
