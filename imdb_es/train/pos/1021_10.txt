The first and second season began with tremors, with good episodes interspersed among the media, and sometimes resorting to clich√© stories. But once he began to configure the universe in which he exists and began to develop his characters, he became much more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason why this program has it is due to four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humor makes it look much better, Peter's direction is excellent and makes any episode much more entertaining, and Joe and Paul never stop making a funny and interesting episode together. <br /> <br /> Once you understand what the program is about and you know the characters, I doubt you do not like the program. For those who get into the program, I suggest the episodes 'The Other Side', a good serious episode and 'Window of Opportunity', a classic episode of comic relief.
