Wilson (Erica Gavin) is caught by the police and sent to prison in this witty and funny example of the exploitation of Prime 70, which marks the debut as director of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing some of the New World films of mentor Roger Cormans, Demme had the opportunity to direct for the first time, and offers a film that not only offers the tasty and expected doses of nudity and violence, but has an attractive ironic quality too; It is often as fun as it is eye-catching. <br /> <br /> Featured scenes include a rude and lewd vaudeville act performed for the prisoners, as well as a powerful dream / fantasy sequence for Superintendent McQueen, tense and obviously very repressed (The horror icon Barbara Steele , making a wonderful turn in this antagonistic role). I also enjoyed a scene of bank robbery that went crazy and a scene of car theft that was simply noisy. As in other films of this kind, it is also commendable that it be both a portrait of female empowerment and pure exploitation. These women are strong, they do not take the trash away from anyone, and they are more than capable of managing themselves. <br /> <br /> Our sexy cast here takes full advantage of their roles: Juanita Brown as the aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as the cheeky Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as the cute and shy Lavelle, Gavin as the newcomer with her eyes open and Lynda Gold (also known as Crystin Sinclaire) in a brilliant appearance as an accomplice abroad. <br /> <br /> As our climax unfolds, Demme comes up with a tense "beat the clock" ending while our heroines run to save Belle from being lobotomized by the predator Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), the kind of man who does not think about taking advantage of women. <br /> <br /> Along with the tasty score of John Cales, "Caged Heat" is an optimistic entertainment and a guaranteed good time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
