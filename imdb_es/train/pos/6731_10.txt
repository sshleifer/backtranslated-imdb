I rate this 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * Offers information about something I barely understand: surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much as surfing; It's not a temporary thing either, it's a life for these guys. * Buried in the movie is a great surf story; I have never sailed, but I love surf movies, and I have seen many. None showed me what this movie did * The movie was very well edited. It flowed well. The interviews were outstanding * It's interesting from beginning to end <br /> <br /> In summary, it's as good as a documentary like the one I've seen, so I have to qualify in terms of that. So 10/10
