['I was pleasantly surprised that I really liked this movie. Ingenious writing (some &quot;internal&quot; jokes that I got, others that I did not, maybe because the actors spoke one on top of the other), a great performance (in particular, John Cassini), great cameos, an interesting and unique direction. I rented it to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed because he was in such a short time, I blinked and you will miss him!), But I found the movie very entertaining. I&#39;ll see it again before sending it to Netflix. I think the actors and those who want to be actors will really enjoy this movie. The end is something expected, but I wish they had done something different (and more positive). Too bad that the film has not been better received, except in the &quot;festival&quot; market. I suggest it to anyone who loves the acting business.']
