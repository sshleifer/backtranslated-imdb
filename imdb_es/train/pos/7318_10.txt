['Halloween by John Carpenter <br /><br /> Is it the best horror movie of all time? No ... maybe not for everyone, but for me it is and always will be. The film is absolutely great and will always have a very special place in my heart. <br /><br /> It is unfortunate that I could not see this film until twenty years after its release, but even twenty years later, after so many slasher cats came and went, the film still had the same impact it should have had at that time. Before going to see Halloween H20, my father suggested that I take out and buy Halloween 1 and 2 to get the full story, and after seeing Halloween it was quite clear that he defined and established the genre Slasher. <br /><br /> The plot of the film is simple: in 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed in cold blood his sister Judith with a large butcher knife. Imprisoned for fifteen years, where he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, where he begins to harass three girls: Laurie Strode, an innocent wood mouse, Annie Brackett, a sarcastic actress and Lynda Van Der Klok, a beautiful AND sexually vigorous young lady. Dr. Loomis traces Michael here, where he enlists the help of City Sheriff Leigh Brackett, who is skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer. Michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins to kill them one by one, until only the sweet and innocent Laurie remains, which is the main target of Michael&#39;s list. <br /><br /> The casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses had first class performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was impressive in her first role in the cinema, since Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave an exciting performance with their small role as Loomis. Nick Castle, who plays Michael did an outstanding job as the soulless and evil killer, and his walking and body movements were perfect. <br /><br /> One of the highlights of this film is the chilling result of John Carpenter himself, who created one of the most recognizable horror themes of today. The Blue Lighting was creepy and effective, and one of the great moments of this film is when the young Laurie huddles against a wall after seeing her friends dead, and in the shadows behind her face, Michael materializes before knock Michael&#39;s mask was one of the things that most chilled my back, the white face and emotionless worked perfectly. <br /><br /> What makes this film so great is that it is not a bloody film unlike the cheesy Friday The 13th films, in fact, there is little blood in this film and, instead, it works in suspense and tension. <br /><br /> It was so clear that Halloween generated movies like Friday The 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, who is a mere theft of Michael Myers. <br /><br /> To summarize, I suggest you watch this movie at least once in your life, as it is a milestone in the making of movies and, without a doubt, if not the best, it is one of the best horror films of all time.']
