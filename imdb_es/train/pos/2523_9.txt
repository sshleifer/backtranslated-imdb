When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I thought that I guess it's real. The few criticisms I read that were NOT made by shouting at the fangirls were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I was given the opportunity to see it, I was completely ready to moan, make a face, and otherwise, I need to close My eyes to avoid the nonsense. <br /> <br /> I was surprised more than a little, and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has his moments of cheese, camp and general nonsense: I think it's something impossible to avoid when it comes to Gackt Camui, a man who is not known for his sanity, but in general It was completely nice <br /> <br /> No, it is not a work of the genius of cinema, but it is very, very sincere, funny, with a funny choreography, a moving score and a funny cast. I know little about Japanese cinema, so I can not really judge the performance, but considering the fact that the cast spoke a language or an extreme dialect that was foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them almost did not have experience as an actor, I was quite impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, watch this movie. At least, fix it as it comes to Region 1. <br /> <br /> On a side note, there is no homosexual / homoerotic content in this movie. I did not even see a subtext. Do not let people who read too much about things ruin this for you.
