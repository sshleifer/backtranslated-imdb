* SPOILERS * Four men, Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty), decide to go rafting on the Cahulawassee River, before it is flooded. <Br /> <br /> They wanted to have fun, have a good weekend in nature. <br /> <br /> But when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them (Bobby), everything begins to go to Hell in a Handbasket, and this "good weekend" will cost even one of the four lives ... <br /> <br /> 'Deliverance', which in Italian is stupidly titled 'Un Tranquillo Weekend Di Paura' ('A Calm Weekend of Fear'), is the grandfather of films like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre ',' The Hills Have Eyes ',' Wrong Turn ',' Last House On The Left 'and all the other subgenre films' Evil Nature / Revenge ', and one of the most terrifying, right next to' The Hills Have Eyes'. <br /> <br /> Based on a book by James Dickey (who appears in the movie as Sheriff Bullard), it is a chilling story about how someone can get into a situation thinking he knows everything, when he does not. <br /> <br /> And the image of the hand of the dead man rising under the water, or the hands holding the rifle of the single blade are disturbing images that will never leave your mind. <br /> <br /> Release: 9/10.
