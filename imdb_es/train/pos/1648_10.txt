This is one of the best movies ever made. It is a realistic representation of the life of rural ranches, which was a large part of American history. The scenario is 1906, Wyoming, where life had not changed much since the previous century. The film maintains its interest without the added myths of Hollywood. The whole family can watch this movie and be intrigued about what life was like in the United States when it was primarily a rural nation. With this film, you will escape from the present and you will witness the daily life of 100 years ago. In a beautiful and picturesque environment, you will see the hard physical labor required to survive, as well as the constant concerns and worries of the elements and market pressures that will make the difference between success and failure. Watch this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history. This movie is worth your time to watch. My only question is: why are not there more movies like this one?
