Oh, come on, learn to have a little fun. When I was a kid, oh, this movie was worth an Oscar for me. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I had seen. <br /> <br /> Now it's a bit stupid, but come on. If you enjoyed "Excellent Adventure", chances are you have fun with "Bogus Journey". This was the movie before "Dude, where's my car?" Only this one is really fun. Like I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you enjoyed the first one, you would like "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. Just for your enjoyment, look at it, let yourself go and remember that it is a silly comedy. That is all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
