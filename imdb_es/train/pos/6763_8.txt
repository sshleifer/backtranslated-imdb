Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when people (at least people who could do such a thing) sit down to talk about film noir. <br /> <br /> However, some of the best films of the genre, "Out of the Past", "The Killers", "In A Lonely Place", "Night and the City", achieve a level of sophistication elegant that elevates them beyond a moody phrase and its connotations of premonitory shadows, fedoras and fatal femurs. <br /> <br /> "Where the Sidewalk Ends", a fairly hard-to-find movie (the only copy in perhaps the best-stocked video store in Manhattan was a steal from the AMC cable channel) belongs to a category with these classics. <br /> <br /> From the moment the black cloud of opening credits passes, a curtain opens around the crumbling world of fake detective Marc Dixon and, as the moments pass, he gets closer and closer , threatening to suffocate. <br /> <br /> Sure, he's that "policeman with a dark past", but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a somber look and a worried intensity that makes you feel as uncomfortable as he seems. And yes, he has been hitting the suspects for too long, and the newly promoted chief (Karl Malden, in a typically robust and dominant departure) is warning him "for the last time". <br /> <br /> However, Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now. And boy, did not they have it coming? <br /> <br /> "Hoods, feather dusters, jars, nickel gutters", spits when a boss's hard nut bounces off and throws all the complaints the office has been getting on Dixon's right hook. The advice is to calm down for your own good. But instead he takes matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> And what a world of problems you find when it is based on your instincts, and you resort to a nature that may or may not have been transmitted from a previous generation. <br /> <br /> He is immediately in the background with the police, the union, his own partner. The questionable participation of Dixon in an "investigation" about the murder threatens his work, makes him wonder if it is as simple as those he swore to bring. Like Bogart in "Lonely Place", can he "escape" from what he is? "<Br> When she has no one to turn to, she discovers that she has virtually condemned her unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney) that seems as if she could turn her sterile degree into something worthy of returning to casa.a. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this magnificent film is tense and moving.The group of writers who contributed to the production polished the script to a high shine: the dialogue is agile, without disintegrating in the forage parody old-fashioned, passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy. <br /> <br /> And all this top-notch direction and acting are not too skillful or polished to loosen the emotional grip of the film.The gentle angelic beauty of Gene Tierney it is used with great effect, she shows herself as an actress of considerable rank, and her gentle and kind nature is as limitless here as is her psychosis in "Leave it to heaven." The scenes between Tierney and Dixon of Andrews they become more intense and moving, the closer it seems to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Near the end of his rope, cut, bruised and exhausted, Dixon sums up his luck: "Innocent people can also get into terrible traffic jams ..." he says. "A false move and you're on your head." <br /> <br /> Perhaps what makes this film so compelling is the feeling that things can go very wrong for almost anyone, especially for someone who is trying to do the right thing, with a slight change in the wind. , a wrong decision or a blow, or, what is more frightening, due to factors over which you have no control. Noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. "Where the sidewalk ends" does so realistically. <br /> <br /> (A twist on one side: this film, by the way, by law, has a flagrant image of a blonde model who does not seem out of place in Mystery Science Theater.) Strange.) <br /> <br /> But the fans of Noir, hell, ANY movie fans, who have not seen this, are in great pleasure.
