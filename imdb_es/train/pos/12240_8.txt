['If you are the kind of person looking for a realistic movie or one with a strong and credible plot, then this movie is NOT for you. No, you will hate it. However, for those who like sweet and slightly funny comedies, then you will have a good time watching this little movie. <br /><br /> Tony Randall works for the IRS and investigates a nice farmer who never realized he had to file a tax return. No matter how hard you try to convince them of the seriousness of your visit, all the members of the family are happy to have company. They conspired and treated him like one of the family, ... and have plans to have him hook up his daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That&#39;s really about the whole plot there. But the film gets high marks for a fun script and a decent performance. A cute little curiosity from the late fifties.']
