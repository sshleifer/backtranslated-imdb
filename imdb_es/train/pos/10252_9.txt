After having seen "Guinea Pig", I can think of two questions (besides "Am I really a psychopath to see that?"): "Is it a tobacco?" The answer is no ; although it's the closest thing to a tobacco movie I've seen. And then: 'Where the hell have they found that girl?' Because they torture her for 45 minutes, without being given reasons (in fact, there is nothing else in this movie!): Nails torn off, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infested with worms, ... and many more until The final scene (I'm still not sure how they did it). Because she belongs to the 'underground scene in Japan', it is obvious that she did not receive much money. So, what were your (your) motivations? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without subtitles, but it's not a problem (there are no real dialogues, the guys are only insulting her in some scenes). I have not seen the whole series yet, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known to be the best. Still, I rated the 8, because if the purpose was to make people believe it was a snuff, the problem is quite good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could have gone further, as they did in the following ones. <br /> <br /> Another movie that I am hiding from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
