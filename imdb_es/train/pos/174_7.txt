Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the D.C. area, is a bit dim, to put lightly. She runs an old pileup and rents a small room to a couple of gay men. However, she saves the life of a prominent Arab, by receiving a bullet in the butt that was intended for the official. She loves the national press with her crazy comments and sweet looks. Looking for an opportunity, the presidential advisers install it in the protocol department of the government of the United States. Even then, she ruins things sometimes, but she tries hard and learns a lot. She even attracts the romantic attention of an official of the State Department. But is there another sinister plot in the making, involving an Arab man who wants to take another wife? A blonde? HA HA HA HA HA HA. This film presents Goldie as beautiful as an image and as silly "as a fox," as they say. Sunny learns to travel the jungle of the government of the United States very, very well. He even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in the environment of his protocol. Perhaps, the Arab community would be less than happy with this work, but for those who like to laugh, rente this today.
