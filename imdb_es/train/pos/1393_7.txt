['Probably the most capricious delivery of the first season, &#39;Shore Leave&#39; has its ups and downs; some parts are too long and others are cut without blunt, but it can not be denied that everything was thrown except the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode. Kirk and the crew seem to have found the perfect planet for ground license after a long period of service that has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation, etc. For all intents and purposes, it seems to be an uninhabited land, with beautiful landscapes and an ideal climate. The first indication that things can go a little wrong is when McCoy, leading an advanced team, sees Alice (from Wonderland) following a large white rabbit wearing a vest. Kirk lights up and finds others reporting equally strange events and encounters. The only thing they all have in common is that each member of the crew was thinking about the person / place / thing they discovered just before they discovered it. This does not immediately fit Kirk or anyone else. More strangeness occurs, including the sightings of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a WW2 fighter plane, etc; Kirk meets Ruth, a beautiful old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from his days at the Academy, Finnegan. The chase / fight scene with Finnegan continues for too long, but at the same time, McCoy is pierced with a spear by a knight on horseback and is apparently killed. Finally, an old man appears and explains what has been happening. The planet is a futuristic &quot;amusement park&quot; where visitors only have to imagine something to appear. Nothing is permanent; McCoy is not really dead. Once this is explained, Kirk decides to order a land license for everyone, after all. Despite the end of &#39;everything was a dream&#39;, &#39;Shore Leave&#39; is presented as another first class episode of the first season of Star Trek.']
