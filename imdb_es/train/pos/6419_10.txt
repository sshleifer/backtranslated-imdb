This movie is an excellent military movie. It may not be an excellent Hollywood movie, but that does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but that is not the case with this movie. Other critics have found that this movie is too slow for your liking, but ?? as a retired soldier? I appreciate the rhythm that the film crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible, given the two hours and nine minutes allotted. The story itself has been told and re-told several times, but is it for a professional soldier? and an African-American in that? to report on the story presented by the film crew, and when it presents the United States Navy to the world. The history of Brashear's work to become a Navy Diver, and his life as a Navy Diver beyond his graduation, is not the only story that is presented. There is also the story of how Sunday's Master Master Subofficer challenged his Commander in Chief's illegal order that Petty Officer's 2nd Class Petty Officer not pass on his test dive no matter how well he did it, and paid the price of a loss of a line and a change of allocation. He also told the true story of how Brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another sailor who was in line with the race line that he would have broken in two if Brashear had not pushed him out of the way and he himself had fired. This was a complex story that was worth telling, and I will admit that two hours and nine minutes were not enough to tell the full story, and I can say of the scenes deleted on the DVD that the team did everything possible to tell a story. as full as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a great story told in such an integral way, and see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and complete way.
