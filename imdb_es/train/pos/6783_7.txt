If you like "Othello", you will love this movie since half of the film revolves around the theatrical production of the work. <br /> <br /> The film has a great cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as the women in The Life of Colman while Edmond O'Brien plays the enterprising press agent. <br /> <br /> A couple of the support players that I particularly liked was Millard Mitchell as the grizzled reporter who finds an angle and Joe Sawyer, the 1940 response to Drew Carey, who plays the cop in the case. <br /> <br /> Great raw moments in this with black realism at all times.
