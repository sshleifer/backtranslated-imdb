Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such credibility, I just cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth showed her that she wanted to deal with the situation, but it was under the control of her husband. "Think about what he did," said Robert Duvall's character, Joe. The story depicts a rural family facing the accidental death of a child by their brother, called "The Stone Child", which means he was so disturbed and overwhelmed by what he did, that he became emotionally paralyzed. Then, towards the end, when Arnold, the character of Jason Presson, told everything to a stranger, I was so heartbroken by him, that I really thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. Personalized and identified with your character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs, did NOT add much to the film. Unction I thought of Frederick 0.6 c√°lculo, who played cantidades and Sudden cantidadesundary promover of Ruth, Andy, like an imbecolla promover who did not do anything to try to help REGISTRY. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a madwoman beating Arnold out of frustration with his own problems without pity and blaming him for his problems. I really could not feel sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she did not succeed. Both did NOT treat their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the movie and they were totally ridiculous. The secondary role of Wilfred Brimley as grandfather was, since playing was the only character that paid attention to Arnold. I felt that his paper should have been drawn up. The players were only doing what they considered adequate and sufficient. However, I really liked the ending so much, I really smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were a family again. Actually I wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
