Wonderland is the fascinating film that tells the participation of the movie star, John C. Holmes, in the brutal murders of Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The promotion of the film tricks one into thinking that this is a romantic portrait of the porn industry in the vein of Boogie Nights and that is not the case here. In fact, except for some references made by the news that John Holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of real life images of John Holmes, this film is strictly dramatic about the participation of a fallen celebrity. With murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite being misleading, the film is really attractive. The performance of the entire cast is excellent and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is amazing in his ability to bend over. All the gestures of John Holmes. I was completely convinced that I was seeing how John C. Holmes looked and acted in real life. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of John C. Holmes or similar stories about Hollywood then I think you'll enjoy watching Wonderland.
