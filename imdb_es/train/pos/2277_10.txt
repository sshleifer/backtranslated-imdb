While the movie feels a bit long at times, it's worth it. Gordon directs in a style that reminds you of Vonneguts writing styles. Without mercy, reflective, ironic, peculiar and dark, this is a film that will remain with you for quite some time, begging answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are incredible. Sheryl Lee is also wonderful, in a role that will remind us of the Lynch fans of her days as Laura / Maddy. Do not miss this!
