['The scream was Wes Craven&#39;s last decent thriller. Since then, there has been nothing but an unbearable Hollywood gust of trash that is barely good enough for a successful night, including the disappointment of the Scream sequels. Perhaps the genius and craftsmanship dedicated to the film exhausted all their energy and creativity, so that when it came time for dinner, it had nothing that served us more than its own doo doo. Finally, after who knows how many bad films later, he gives us a thriller of suspense with Red Eye, delicious, ruthless, exciting and spooky. <br /><br /> Rachel McAdams, once again, offers a pleasant performance while playing a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important and regular political figure in his hotel. Then he meets Jackson Ripner (Cillian Murphy, Batman Beyond) at the airport, whom he knows a little better after a delayed flight and a breeze from the bay. What she does not know is that he already knows her. And he also knows his father, whom he will never see again if he does not cooperate and does not comply with Jackson&#39;s demands: use his connections to set up his hotel for the murder. <br /><br /> You&#39;re probably thinking that this is nothing more than your complete daily thriller with predictability and chase scenes. Although this is a good old thriller, that is its beauty. There are no special effects. There is no cheap makeup. Only the classic suspense. You feel the despair and regret every decision that McAdams is forced to take and really take care of her while encouraging her in every movement she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position. <br /><br /> As always, she offers an entertaining and convincing performance. It&#39;s her sweet face or her strange ability to cry sincerely, but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it. Cillian Murphy, on the other hand, has a naturally creepy look, so even if the trailer did not reveal it, her last transition from the charming stranger to the ruthless imbecile is not that surprising. Perhaps it would have been more trivial to see a good kind of person like Toby Maguire becoming a relentless and evil madman. However, Cillian Murphy, once established his true identity, played the role so solidly that he really wanted him to die, or at least to kick his ass. <br /><br /> Do not overlook this feature. There are a lot of gaudy moments on the board and heart leaps that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch as you would in the recent photos of Craven. If it is not for you, do it all the times you will see your girlfriend, your boyfriend or someone with popcorn jumping and clinging to you. Wes finally does it well. Apart from his suspended mastery, Red Eye is not without humor as the replacement of McAdams, Cynthia, at the reception, to keep the hotel in order. It was a relief that Red Eye was not a disappointment. Instead, you&#39;ll have the pleasure of seeing McAdams deliver another incredibly talented performance, Murphy becomes more spooky at the moment and Craven creates a classic suspense classic. A flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of Craven&#39;s rebirth had it arrived just after Scream.']
