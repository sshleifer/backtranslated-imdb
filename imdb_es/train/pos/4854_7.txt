Curl up with it on a dark and stormy night and prepare to have fun, get irritated and frightened alternately. The old crunchy plot about a ghost train that is said to run through the lonely English countryside late at night may be unlikely, but it's very funny. There are some wonderful old clich√©s like "THE ACCIDENT" that locals can remember but will not talk about. But mainly the film is a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to show his particular style of vaudeville humor among the fragments of terror. Askey's cheesy humor is not very fashionable these days, but if you let him shower you it can be fun. This is probably the best of Askey's movies.
