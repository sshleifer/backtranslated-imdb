I read that he approached Jessie Matthews and refused to co-star with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews at her best never left her side of the pond to make any American musical film. If they had joined for this movie, it would have been a unique event in life. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because Damsel in Distress has everything else going for it. Fred Astaire, told and adapted to the screen by the author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for comedy, and songs by the Gershwin brothers. In response to the question posed by Nice Work If You Can Get It, there is not much you can ask for more for this movie. <br /> <br /> Except one protagonist. Although Ginger Rogers made several films away from Fred Astaire, Damsel in Distress is the only film that Astaire made without Rogers when they were a team. The young Joan Fontaine was chosen for this opposite Astaire. <br /> <br /> Your character has nothing of what Ginger Rogers does in these movies. Basically, all you have to do is act sweet and demure. She does not contribute anything musically either. And if I had to qualify all of Fred Astaire's dance partners, Joan Fontaine would come out in the background. The poor woman is simply awful in the number of Things Are Looking Up. <br /> <br /> When she later co-starred in a musical with Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it's no coincidence that Fontaine is given nothing musical to do. <br /> <br /> The version I have is colored and, in this case, I think he actually did something good. The idyllic and green English countryside of P.G. Wodehouse is really taken out in this VHS copy. Especially in that number that I mentioned before with Astaire and Fontaine, which takes place in the garden. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Burns & Allen, like a pair of old vaudeville soldiers, complement Astaire with great style in the rigid upper lip number. The sequence of the surrealist playhouse is wonderfully organized. <br /> <br /> P.G. Wodehouse's aristocracy spans the full spectrum with Constance Collier at his best and for once, Montagu Love as Fontaine's father as a good man in the film. <br /> <br /> The biggest success of A Damsel in Distress is A Foggy Day perhaps the The most well-known song about the British capital since the London Bridge is falling. Made in the best simple and elegant way by Fred Astaire, it is one of those songs that will last as long as London lasts and even after. <br /> <br /> With a view of the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, A Damsel in Distress qualifies as A classic, classical score, classical dance, classical comedy. Who could ask for something more?
