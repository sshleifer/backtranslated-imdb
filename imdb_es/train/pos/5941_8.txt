This is a short film made by fans that pretends to be an advance of a new movie that combines Batman and Superman! It's the kind of movie that fans love and see in places like ComicCon and it was made by the same person who did BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> In regards to this movie, I could easily choose separately. Surely the CGI effects are not perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT, this was done with a reduced budget and for a movie of fans it is incredible. I was particularly impressed by the very amateur Superman, he was not a weak little man! If it was just a preview of a real movie, they would have fans lined up from here to Omaha to watch it. Great job.
