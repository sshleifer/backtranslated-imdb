Attempted actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this black cinema of today a winner. Of the three, I do not know who was the most interesting since they all offer good performances and intriguing characters. <br /> <br /> Patric makes the narration in this noir, playing a former boxer and mental patient. Wow, that only makes for an interesting guy! It seems silly, but it is not. Ward is the astute, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co-conspirator of a failed kidnapping plan. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern never fails to fascinate in any movie. <br /> <br /> The movie could be considered a bit downcast for the average viewer, but I found it fascinating ... and I do not like depressing movies normally. What I found was a kind of peculiar crime movie. Take a look and see if you agree. This is a pretty unknown movie that should not have that status because it's just a good story and it's well done.
