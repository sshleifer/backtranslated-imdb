A family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) goes out for a family reunion in a remote house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving there. This angers some of the locals, especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (very slowly) go wrong. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started seeing this. Most of the reviews for this, on this site, are extremely negative. Well ... I do not agree. First of all it is NOT a horror movie. The horror does not even begin until the final 30 minutes. It is played more like a family drama with elements of horror. On that level, it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> First - the bad: the rhythm is VERY slow; Jake Weber is a horrible actor; WAY too many fake dreams sequence scares; the wendigo barely appears in the film and the clear vision we have of the wendigo at the end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The good: pretty good dramatic script; Clarkson is excellent as the mother; good direction with mysterious sound effects that give a bit of fear; a fairly explicit hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the plot!); Pretty good performance of Sullivan (only 10 at that moment!) and Speredakos and a tragic end completely unexpected. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people are upset with this movie because it's considered a horror movie, which is not. So, if you can ignore that, I think you might like it. I give him a 7.
