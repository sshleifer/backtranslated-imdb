The film ends after the court summarizes ... <br /> <br /> The film is told in three flashback segments when each of the witnesses assumes the position. The story takes place mainly in a small Polish town and the memorable scenes include the reaction of the people to the death of Anna (Shirley Mills), whom Wilhelm is accused of raping; the treatment of Jewish villagers as they prepare to be transferred to concentration camps; and the church service where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) denounces his Nazi education while crying for his girlfriend Janina (Dorothy Morris), Marja's daughter, after he was shot in a brothel. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Knox does not regret and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and evil man.

This film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it's over.
