You have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done something really cool, it's 10 out of 10, so I can not believe that another user of this website has rated it so bad, unless they expected to see only a normal movie, with people, scenes of love, and so on. I am also convinced that this type of documentary is an excellent way to wake up to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with the documentary film by Al Gore, "An Inconvenient Truth", composed mainly of long monologues, painfully and with "truths" that are not always accurate, as many scientists have already pointed out. <br /> <br /> The best you can do on earth is not to miss Earth.
