It is not the same as the other films about dancing. Some normal people were dancing. Unlike the dance films in Hollywood, the characters in this movie are not young or hot. They are people you can see every day in your offices. They are a little depressed about their lives and, finally, they meet and dance their dreams. This touches me very deeply.
