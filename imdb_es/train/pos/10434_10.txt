the most surprising combination of love and psyche of two young people. It is presented in the most sublime way and definitely touches your heart. A rare combination in which the sequel exceeds the prequel in both the narrative and the intensity of emotions. The film reiterates your faith in love and the pain of separation. the joy of seeing your beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have rehearsed eternal characters with such simplicity that they give the film a great joy and love to see. A film that must be seen for all people who believe in true love. By far, the most romantic movie (at least one of them) of all time.
