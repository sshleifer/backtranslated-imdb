"Read My Lips" speaks of a strange symbiosis that develops between a simple office worker (socially maladroit) (Devos) and her apprentice in the workplace, a raw ex-con (Casel). As the film transmits this unusual duo to their identifications, they become entangled in a chilling fusion of minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary result. Good things for anyone in films driven by characters with strong psychodramatic currents. In French with easy-to-read subtitles and good translation. (B +)
