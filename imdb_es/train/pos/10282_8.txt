If your idea of ​​a thriller is car chases, explosions and dozens of people being shot down, then "House of Games" is definitely not the movie for you. If you like and appreciate the psychological drama and the suspense, then, of course, look at it. <br /> <br /> "House of Games" tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the dark world of scammers led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). Saying something more about the plot would ruin the suspense. Frankly, I can hardly believe that someone who claims to have seen the turns coming. Like an intelligent swindler, this movie attracts him to his network and calms his vigilance. <br /> <br /> The story is tense and well elaborated, the dialogue intelligent and laconic, the uniform performance is good (Mantegna is magnificently charismatic). Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very nice character, and they wonder why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford is supposed to be cold and distant; In addition, his kindness is essential to the plot (at one point, I think an injury to his sexual self-esteem is a key part of his motivation ... I will not say more). <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is a dark look at the lower part of human nature that concludes with a note of uncomfortable ambiguity. It will keep your attention every second while you are watching, and it will remain with you for a long time afterwards.
