['Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler who just got out of jail when the movie begins. As soon as he goes out the doors, he immediately starts working on a plan to go back to making a stealing package, although this time he has his sights set too high. This is really one of the weak points of the film, since apparently it does not know anything about computers (few did it in 1968), but it manages to become a genius of computers literally overnight! Yeah sure. Anyway, he comes up with a plan to pose as a computer expert and get a job at a large US corporation so that he can eventually embezzle a ton of cash. Considering that his knowledge of computers is rudimentary, it is amazing how he implements a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses. But, after all, it&#39;s a movie, so I could suspend disbelief. At the end of the movie, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) can escape with a million pounds. <br /><br /> However, in the end, it becomes very, very confusing and Smith announces that he managed to accumulate more than two million by investing in the companies that Ustinov created (although he did not realize that they were all fictitious companies). This should mean that eventually these stocks you bought had no value. What they seem to imply (and you might be guessing wrong here) is that Ustinov and his new partners swiftly cashed in the shares before this became known and the stock thus became useless. Either way, the film seems to be published in a magical ending where no one is hurt and everyone is happy, and this simply did not make much sense. It&#39;s a shame, really, since the acting and most of the writing was great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were wonderful. <br /><br /> If it seems that I have interpreted the ending, let me know, since the film seemed very vague in the details at the end.']
