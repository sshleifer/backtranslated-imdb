The freedom to have your own Sea Going Power Boat, the thrill of living underwater adventures, a robust, an adventurous and charming man (and very well endowed!) Of excellent Bikinis were all definitive points of sale for "SEA HUNT" (1958-61). <br /> <br /> What was the reason for producing a kind of "weapons on demand" series? Let's look closely now. There must be some clues around. <br /> <br /> If we had to look back a bit, we see the RKO Radio Pictures production of UNDERWATER! (1955). Starring Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive scuba diving adventurers working in the salvage in the Caribbean, including a Cuba previous to Fidel. The film was moderately successful and memorable, not necessarily because of its history, but because of the appearance of the main ones in swimsuits. Fine and well-formed, the women in some 2-piece swimsuits (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Are always an advantage for the Guys; and the presence of robust and athletic people who show their best "poses" of meatloaf is equally pleasing to the Gals. <br /> <br /> And there is an element that is a true legacy of this old RKO feature. It is in the Soundtrack contained between the tails and the musical themes. It is the recording of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White", written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and performed by Damaso PÃ©rez Prado and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone who listens to this Insturmental or song (with lyrics) will not forget it soon. His Carribbean Beat is very lively and his rich use of the Orchestra's Metal Section is Powerful and instantly produces an instant impression and memory. The record of 45 RPM of this song reached the 10 best popular songs of the week during many Saturday nights on "YOUR HIT PARADE" of NBC TV. We can not remember how many weeks or how high it came. (Maybe someone can tell us about that topic, please!) Then, we went back to "SEA HUNT" and his own odyssey to get on the "Tube". The public had been auctioned! Okay, but they would go to a television series. <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions earned a reputation for publishing a type of product that, for the most part, was not signed by the networks for the treatment of multiple station connection. But they had had some great successes with Television Syndication. ** By this we mean, to offer a Series of Stations for exhibitions in a TV station for each Market Area. (Like the various Newspaper Trade Unions "sell" comic strips to various newspapers throughout the country and even to the world. <br /> <br /> So, we have 'Mike Nelson', himself, in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges Mr. Bridges had existed for approximately 15 years and had performed some very memorable performances in mainly secondary and very diverse roles in a couple of Boston Blackie movies (with Chester Morris) for THEY STOOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges 1943), SAHARA (also 1943), HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949) and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd brought a very convincing way to his characterization, together with an excellent physicist and convincingly athletic, with the appearance of a boy who earns his living with his physical abilities, he performed very well as a Diver's Diver, either to perform tasks on board a ship or to swim under the sea. <br /> <br /> And Lloyd made him take the paper quickly, but contrary to the large amount of misinformation that exists, he was not familiar with SCUBA. *** before landing this Mike Nelson concert. But Athletic Mr. Bridges proved to be a fast learner, as many of the underwater close-ups revealed that there was no doubt about it, that Lloyd was wearing the mask, the bubbler (air tank) and fins. . <br /> <br /> Stories almost always involved helping some customers pay, as a private detective would. So what would happen if the client were a beautiful lady who looked good in the swimsuit? Better. <br /> <br /> Like many of the other television productions of ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS, "SEA HUNT" had a fine, Haunting Opening Theme and Closing, along with original music and incidental tails. <br /> <br /> At some point, I think "SEA HUNT" was the main syndicated television series, a success that the ZIV Series had known before with the likes of "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". As for the place where this underwater saga is shown, here in Chicago it was shown late at night (after 10:30 PM) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I can remember who was the original sponsor in this particular market. And there were even scene announcements made by Star! How well we can remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson, riding his Power Boat. And when they invited us to come back next week and see "..... another adventure of" SEA HUNT ", sponsored by G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin, the creators of Old Style Lager Beer!", All while Mike offered us, lifting an old-style bottle. (What a shame, Mike! Drink beer in your boat in motion! We are telling the Coast Guard!) Then, the boat would leave the dock, accompanied by the theme of sea hunting and credits. <br /> <br /> NOTE: * More figuratively than literally, Mike was hired and things were much like a deterctive story. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ** ZIV's syndicated successes included the "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "POINT OF THE WEST" (and its clone "MEN OF ANNAPOLIS"), "SEA HUNT" and " HIGHWAY PATROL ". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And, of course, SCUBA is the acronym for "Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus".
