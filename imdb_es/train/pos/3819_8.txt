I have been waiting to see this movie for a long time and I was finally able to see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I expected too much from this movie and that's why I was a little disappointed. It was not the best film in Korea, but it's still worth watching. <br /> <br /> The theme was nice and the movie makes you keep looking without getting bored, although it's long. But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another. However, the performance of Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in early film history and I think this movie would not be so good if she was not in the lead role.
