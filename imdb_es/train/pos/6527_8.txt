['The documentary begins by establishing the perspective to several light years. The traveler travels through our milky way with the sounds of our earthly lives, like a space monument for (possible?) Aliens. <br /><br /> The documentary contains images of Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and JB Lenoir. The images of JB have never been published before. The narrative is from &#39;Willie Blind&#39; Dixon. However, it is made by an actor. The film shows the work of all these first bluesmen followed by versions and interpretations of musicians, such as Nick Cave and the bad Seeds, among others. <br /><br /> The Death of JB Lenoir (John Mayall&#39;s song) is an amazing event in history. Lenoir became politically engaged and is considered to belong to the Martin Luther King League and his peers. His political interests can be found in the subjects of his lyrics. <br /><br /> Blues is found to be &#39;THE&#39; native music of America. The blues are the roots and the rest are the fruits. <br /><br /> The title &#39;Soul of a Man&#39; is after a song by Willie Dixon.']
