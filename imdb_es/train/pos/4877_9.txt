Actually, a particular person / character is not "there," but my summary line refers to the power of the movie. And all this is achieved without sophisticated camera movements and / or large production sets, but with a great history and very (credible) and good actors who convey the story (arc). <br /> <br /> You could call it a piece of accompaniment to the great movies / movies of Japan (like Tokyo Story, etc.), not so much in terms of history, of course, but more in the mood! Great performance, nuances in the performances that are truly gems. If you are anxious to experience a moving story and you want to see a movie that touches you emotionally, then this is the place to go. As you may have noticed (as in many of my comments), I am not entering the story. There are places here in IMDb where you can look for them, I'm not one to spoil the story at all!
