The 12th Disney animated classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story. Although a little outdated, it deserves a place in the list of Disney classics. <br /> <br /> It is not among the best works of Disney, but it is satisfactory. One of the most "simple" works of Disney, yes, but maintains some magic and charm (so the old Disney is well known). This was an important film because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If this were a failure, there would be no more Disney animated classics. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is like going back to Disney's animated classic ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs") because the Fairytale genre is back. It is not clear where the story unfolds, but I suppose it is somewhere in France because it is based on a story by Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many nice characters, like Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno. (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the Fairy Godmother (for a fairy who is probably fun), the birds, the King and the Grand Duke. <br /> <br /> Jaques is very smart and funny. I love your voice. It really has that mouse quality. Gus might not be so smart, but it's funny. <br /> <br /> The King is very funny, but I think what makes him so funny is his bad temper. The Grand Duke is a very cool and fun guy too. They are two of my favorite characters in this movie and responsible for many of the funniest moments. <br /> <br /> The Prince is undoubtedly one of Disney's most charming. There is no doubt that Prince Philip of "Sleeping Beauty" was inspired by this prince, because they look very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) is not supposed to be nice. Because it is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. His daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than her. However, the stepmother is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, beautiful and adorable. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dress is much prettier than the one that the Fairy Godmother gave her. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously malicious. The way he walks, sticking his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make it fun. Ironically, she looks a lot like the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitudes towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is a mean and devilish cat. However, there is nothing disturbing about him. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but nice, although it is not among the best of Disney. The best song in this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are a lot of well-known voice actors with talent in this, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. <br /> <br /> Despite being simple in appearance, the film has good illustrations, as well as its beautiful details, although never something "out of this world". However, the king's palace is a spectacular masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal.
