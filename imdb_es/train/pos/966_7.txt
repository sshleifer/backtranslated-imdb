Report of the Toronto Film Festival 2005 It is official; "Takashi Miike" is beaten. <br /> <br /> The annual midnight screening of the new movie "Takashi Miike", "The Big Spook War" or "The Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô". Call it whatever you want. This is a fanatical trip. <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, the intrepid programmer, declared that this film was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of "The Lord of the Rings" or "Endless Story" for Japan. After the screening, I can understand where they were going with that, but after all this is "Takashi Miike". He directed the film of '01 "Ichi the Killer", when the presentation at the festival bags were distributed in the presentation. And no, that was not just a marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: A child with a problematic family life becomes "chosen", and finds himself in the midst of a Great Spirit war, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become in your peers through your trip. <br /> <br /> This is not really for children, well, it's not too young. Certainly, watch them get scared with some of these spirits (even the friends) on display. This is different from everything I've seen in the movies before. A fantasy naturally, a very funny (but dark) material. You will not be bored you can guarantee that. Will you ever reach North America? Doubtful. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
