['Before seeing in this movie, I see many comments, that everyone has a great vision of the film, good or bad ... <br /><br /> What I really want to point out is acting on behalf of Woody Harrelson, it may not be in many parts of the film, but when it appears or even the introduction, I was surprised by the &quot;message&quot; of Will Smith and Woody Harrelson that they tried. Create and maybe slide the whole plot to the end to really understand what is happening. <br /><br /> I am not a very sentimental person, I believe that a good action should not have remorse or pity for it. But an act to show redemption, there are not many films that, from my point of view, can show this. This is one of them that can. <br /><br /> I agree with a person who commented that this movie that shows acts of &quot;suicide&quot; is a disadvantage, however, I do not believe that this is the &quot;message&quot; that the film is trying to send, but the &quot;sacrifice&quot;. A bit to the extreme, but that is the message in MY opinion. <br /><br /> This movie has potential. The performance is worth every penny, the script is incredible. from a person who does not like watching drama movies ... if you like drama, you should go see it.']
