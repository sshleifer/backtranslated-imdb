I really liked that movie! It was all I could do to keep from crying while I watched him, but it's really very uplifting. I was surprised by the performance of Ray Liotta, but especially the talent of Tom Hulce playing Ray's twin brother, who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event. But the character of Tom, although heartbreaking, does not know self-pity and is so full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss it!
