Before watching Show People, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only. I could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without trusting a lot in the spoken word or in many situations. But this masterful film showed that I was wrong. Davies, in my opinion, was probably the best comedy actress that appeared before Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy primarily because Davies's facial manners and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point where I wonder if Davies was not one of Ball's main influences. This comes from a 21-year-old boy who had never seen a silent comedy before, and I must say that no matter how much of the specific references of each period you receive (apparently I did not), this will not bore you. movie. You will probably even laugh more than you would in most comedies. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but also easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
