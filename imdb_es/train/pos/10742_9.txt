Hard movie to comment, how do you say it's bad? Well, it is not, but then it is equally difficult to say that it is good. What it is, is a convincing observation, is the closest you can get to absolute devastation without being there. They are the photographs of the tsunami that is approaching the coast of Thailand, you know you want to turn around but you have to look. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers handle the comment very well, even in most cases. Tragic circumstances, is not seen in something that is happening in another country, or panders or insults. The facts are in the cellulose and it takes little for the viewer to understand or understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> You can not change the story, and you should not want to, this movie is a testimony of humanity in its darkest hour.
