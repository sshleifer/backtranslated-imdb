David Lynch usually makes films that look like improperly armed puzzles. They are interesting to look at and think about, but they really do not get confused in your mind. Perhaps art always means more to its creator. <br /> <br /> The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch movie. It's not like there's anything typical of them anyway. It is an odyssey through rural America. A real-life trip Alvin Straight took a lawnmower to get to his brothers' house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to compensate his sick brother for past crimes. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this film is the sweet voice of Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight directly to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow paced coincides with Alvin's slow journey towards realization. <br /> <br /> On the way, Alvin meets a confused and frightened young woman. She is pregnant and has decided to flee from her situation. After listening to Alvin talk about the family, she reconsiders. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin witnesses how an anguished woman kills a deer with his car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad, but he's smart enough to cook some beloved meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin's lawn mower loses the brakes and almost kills him. A good man and his wife let him stay in his yard while he fixed it. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, very well played by Sissy Spacek, who was pursuing a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to take Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin refuses with thanks. <br /> <br /> While Alvin waits, he also goes to a bar with a kind old man while they discuss the harshness of the war and the price it charged for their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has haunted him forever. <br /> <br /> Alvin also runs into two brothers who have repaired their lawn mower. He says them in price wisely, calling them for their high labor and repair costs. It even helps them appreciate each other by learning from their own mistakes with their brother. <br /> <br /> The night before Alvin leaves the man's yard, he takes off his hat. The man tells him it was an honor to stay and asks Alvin to write him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. It's sincere because it's so direct, so real. <br /> <br /> The trip continues and we can not help getting more and more involved with him. We want Alvin to reach his brothers. We want him to make peace. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film and his performance was incredible. You can not help but understand their pride, listen to their wisdom and, ultimately, feel their pain. One stays as busy with him as the man who offers his backyard to stay. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, then Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth are sitting together in a bar. I can imagine them discussing their lives, regrets, hopes and joys. As Alvin says in the movie: "My brother and I used to look at the stars." Well, I know everyone is with the best view of the house.
