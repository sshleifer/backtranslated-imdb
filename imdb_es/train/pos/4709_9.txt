Well, I confess it. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He makes a beautiful parody of someone who makes a parody of James Cagney, with charm to spare. <br /> <br /> The cast of support is all solid workers, and they will come together to do a good job in this 80s comedy. A parody of the gangster films of the 30s and 40s, constantly breaking new ground, with remarkably original material. (Well, yes, part of it has been copied since then, but when this movie was made, it was original and much of it has not been copied anywhere else). Look at Joe Piscopo who warns people not to do ______, with one of the great Taglines of the parodies. Watch Roman Moronie do things profanity in English that would make her grammar teacher laugh. Watch amazing visual gags, like the owner of the pet store Johnny Kelly, who uses the price gun on his puppies and dust his kittens. Watch the best "warning against sex" educational film ever made. Look at the most amazing false representation of the Latin of the church, while a guy who was never from the shop class assembles a Thompson machine gun with parts. Look at the lines you will use in an informal conversation over the next decade. Look at Maureen Stapleton, the perfect antithesis for the working mother, with surprise gags that she will never see coming. <br /> <br /> If you see a gag that does not hit your funny bone, be patient. another will come in 30 seconds or less, and most likely you have to pause until you finish rolling on the floor several times. Ducklings and bunnies? They too. Be alert to subtle things: some of the sight gags may go unnoticed in the first sightings. <br /> <br /> There are some minor flaws, but it's probably the best patch. Some are close, but none of them is that good.
