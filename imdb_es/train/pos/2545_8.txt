The invisible beam is an excellent display of the talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff achieves impeccable performance as a surly and conflicting scientist who seems to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even with his wife. His already lonely personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays an accomplished professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain a good relationship with everyone, but who does not seem to have a real life. intimate friends. This was one of his few roles as a good boy and he does it very well. It is difficult, however, to listen to his accent and believe he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie was that everything was based on "junk science" but, in a way, even junk science makes it work well. Since ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are as "relevant" today as they were when the film was made. And they are also so advanced and always will be. <br /> <br /> This is a perfectly lovely movie to watch over and over again. I saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and could easily sit five times more. The acting is wonderful and science is fun. I highly recommend it.
