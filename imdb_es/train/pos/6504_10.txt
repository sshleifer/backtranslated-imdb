['My wife and I have seen this whole series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. This is not the &quot;complete&quot; history of World War II, no library could have such a story, but it is the best summary of that history. Many details, many personal stories, and still keeps the big picture in sight. <br /><br /> Olivier&#39;s narrative is excellently written and, of course, superbly given. Interviews are from all sides, except from Russian, because the producers were not allowed to talk to many Russians. It is really worth having this complete program on DVD. We treasure our copy. <br /><br /> The producer does an excellent job of providing images and actions where almost none existed in any archive: for example, there are almost no convoy movies and submarine battles, but even so, the episode on this subject is very well done.']
