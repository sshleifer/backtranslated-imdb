I did not expect to be so shocked by this film that portrays a family as one would expect to live next door. They are normal people of flesh and blood, not like the typical Hollywood food. They face a very common problem: a debilitating disease. But the story line grabs the heart with a powerful lesson. The casting, the script, the direction and the performance flow together with a wave that attracts the viewer to the depth of the story. Give this film your full attention and your message will really inspire you.
