Peter Sollett has created an endearing portrait of real people living in poverty on the Lower East Side of New York, or Loisaida, as the locals know it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Sollett's heart is in the right place while examining this dysfunctional family, which is typical of the different 'inner cities' of the country. Mr. Sollett emphasizes the positive in the story he presents. These are basically good children, the children of the parents who have left them and whose grandmother has taken their wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting his characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows a positive side that everyone has. These children do not engage in drugs, or they are stealing because they are poor. If Hollywood had made this story, we would have seen a parade of stereotypes, rather than children who are struggling, but deep down they are not defeated. <br /> <br /> Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was a revelation. He is a natural. This is July Mars. His character shows us a sensible girl who will not be fooled nor will she push to do anything she does not want to do. Altagracia Guzm√°n, since the grandmother is excellent. She conveys her frustration at not being able to guide her grandchildren to the things that she believes in and that are so important to her. <br /> <br /> In general, this was an excellent image thanks to Peter Sollett.
