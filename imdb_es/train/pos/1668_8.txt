Artimisia was on the previous night last night. At first I thought I would not like it, but since I did not want to sleep and nothing else, I continued to observe myself and I was intrigued by the young Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. His romance with Major Tassi envied recognizable feelings. Although the film is based on a very romantic level and not in reality, I loved it much more than the usual biographies or costume dramas. Great game, great camerashots, great music and texts. I loved it and I want more! :-)
