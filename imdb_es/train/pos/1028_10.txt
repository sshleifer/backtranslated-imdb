['I have to say that, from the beginning, when I saw the Stargate movie, I was not impressed or something like an average science fiction movie, with a lot of POTENTIAL, although the movie was not that amazing. Like other science fiction movies, like Star wars or aliens, if you&#39;re a science fiction fan, you&#39;ll admit that one of those two titles is incredible, although I&#39;m not as fan of science fiction as some people, I do not. remember a line from any of those movies, I&#39;m not a big fan of wearing Star Wars shirts, in fact, if you saw me, I would look like an average person, I&#39;m deviating from the subject here, well, my point is that you do not have to Be a science fiction fan so that you like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 incredible seasons without any fall in its quality as it approached its end, in 2006. <br /><br /> Although I did not like the film very much, I was waiting for the first season in 1997, and let me tell you that special effects were just one of the brilliant things in the series, the chemistry between the characters just shocked me. The special effects were as good, if not better, than most of the science fiction programs that run today. I have to admit that I would never have entered science fiction if it were not for Stargate, and my father, who really got me into science fiction when I was about 6 years old, and I&#39;m glad he did, otherwise I would not. I have not seen brilliant programs like SG1, which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for almost all science fiction series and movies, basically, if a new science fiction series is not better or as good as SG1, it&#39;s not worth the shame to see it. Basically, this is the best science fiction show to date, and if you do not see it, you have no idea what you&#39;re missing!']
