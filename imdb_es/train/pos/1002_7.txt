Only two comments ... SEVEN years apart? Hard evidence of the film's relentless pulling force! As mentioned, the low budget telemobilization status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in your limited appeal. That said, however, the thing does not lack merit, either as entertainment or as a way out of fear itself. <br /> <br /> It's true that the plot in its most basic form is a reworking of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror. Plus a case of intrigue! Gibney could have made a better impression if he had played with Halifax, investigating a pair of seemingly unconnected murders with the "house" as the main suspect. The script is better than the average and the production in general of a high level. It simply does not attract the viewer, especially at key moments. <br /> <br /> Having collected the DVD for only $ 3.95 last week in my usual video store, I can not set aside the expenses. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the movie. Just do not expect fireworks!
