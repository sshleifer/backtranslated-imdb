Nicolas Roeg's projects are variable to say the least, but they are never less interesting. The "insignificance" is obviously, above all, a game of adapted scenario: it is neat and is quite 'limited to the room'. BUT, it's worth watching this movie more than once: the underlying themes are not presented openly and, what's more, it takes a while to adjust to the juxtaposition and reversal of roles of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is devastated by Hiroshima's guilt, but he likes the simplicity of a sexual relationship with Munro; Munro is tired of being seen as a fool and craves intellectual credibility; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witch-hunting powers, but he's a helpless imbecile; DiMaggio is unsure about his celebrity, obsessed with himself and prone to violence. Each of them contains the seeds of its own destruction. Each character has a problematic, abused / abusive past and a questionable future. Gradually, we see that the obsession itself is the central issue. The obsession of the United States with its icons and post-war cultural customs; the obsessions of the protagonists for something that nobody can have: peace of mind and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared to the theory of relativity, a proposed unified field theory and, indeed, the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of Roeg's protagonists seem insignificant. However, these aspects of the physical universe (everything is quantum, trust me!) Affect us when applied to the development of the means to destroy us. Monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb (without naming it as such) is not an anachronism per se, but can only be understood by a contemporary audience. In fact, ALL the references within the script are only accessible to a well-informed viewer: an au fait with occurrences / personality cults of the 50s and how they affect us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This movie and his script are either very, very smart, or extremely opaque and pretentious. However, ultimately, it is probably insignificant. <br /> <br /> live and prosper :) <br /> <br />
