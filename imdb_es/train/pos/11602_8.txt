Now I had the pleasure of seeing Contaminated Man for the first time when it premiered on television in December 2000. <br /> <br /> An infectious disease expert (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease enters the world. your home and kill them. . Now, some years later, it is now in Russia or somewhere. I'm not sure where exactly, all I know is that it takes place somewhere in that area. In any case, due to budget cuts in a laboratory of infectious diseases, they are forced to dismiss the majority of their workers. One of them, a disgruntled security guard named Joseph Muller (played Peter Weller, best known for his role as indestructible Robocop) enters there and demands that he get his job back. She needs this job because she is divorced and needs it to pay child support. Then he goes in there, a fight breaks out, and some things collapse, dangerous things. It is soon discovered that Muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it is so deadly that a drop of your blood will kill a person in a matter of seconds. Soon the word gets out and the disease expert (Hurt) is called in to investigate and later he teamed up with an American journalist. Now Muller is determined to get home to see his wife and child and will stop at nothing, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said before, this movie is very similar to Falling Down. We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down) who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, even if they have to kill some people in the process. Next we have a person of hero type (Wounded here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down) who is nice and is determined to stop the antagonist. <br /> <br /> Contaminated Man is indeed a very good movie with a good story. Line and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
