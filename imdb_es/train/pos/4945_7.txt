It is a difficult movie to classify "10 articles or less". In general, I do not care to define genres, but there is something in this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category, to convey, even with a single word, your feelings about it. I recommend this movie completely to anyone, and if you really enjoy movies and enjoy life, you'll want to do the same as soon as you finish watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and I call it beautiful and charming admitting that it is not perfect but that it does not do anything wrong. I do not want to sound like he's contradicting me, but I think writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script. I'm sure I wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection: a product that was as simple, attractive and inflexible as its title. Well, he has done it. <br /> <br /> Silberling, director of long, complex and dramatic films like "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", demonstrates with "10 Items or Less", which closes in only 70 minutes, the passion that He has for his work and also the faith he has in it. What Silberling proposes here is to put an actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of a woman (Paz Vega) in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places that ordinary life would take them. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you anything else because within the apparent simplicity there is a fund that invites reflection and that should not be underestimated. Because everyone here is exposed: the camera focuses directly on the two main characters, who share an endless conversation on a car trip with stops that are not infinite just because life is life. And let me express the praise of how well Silberling handles the situation by saying that it arrives, in less time (not only in the duration of the film, but in the only day that the film develops its events) and in a more small, the type of connection between two characters that Sofia Coppola generated in "Lost In Translation". <br /> <br /> That film, set in Tokyo, also found an actor and a woman, and they also had conversations about the times when they lived their lives. It is in the conversations where we perceive the provocative quality of "10 elements or less" and, as in the Coppola film, the naturalness of each situation is never lost and the images with all the music and without words do not seem forced or included . in the image to 'buy time'. <br /> <br /> In this aspect, the collaboration of Silberling and his director of photography Phedon Papamichael. The man who filmed the beautiful landscapes in "Sideways" and focused on each emotion in "Patch Adams", delights us here with visual passages of true natural beauty. <br /> <br /> But the final beauty of "10 Items or Less" can be found in its cast (by Avy Kaufman), in its two protagonists. They are the ones that transmit this feeling that I mentioned at the beginning and I can not specify; we feel their connection and we can say that they are having fun and that they may even be improvising things. The Academy Award winner, Morgan Freeman, also executive producer of the film, simply stays there and confirms the status he has today in the film industry, and one that is well deserved: a quiet man, full of wisdom that can make you crying easily when he can make you laugh And the beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said it was great in "Spanglish"). Here it shows that she is the real one, and that Hollywood is not small for her.
