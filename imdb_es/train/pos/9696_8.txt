I'm not a fan of newer movies, but this was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children can see it together, how unusual! My aunt liked it too. I had laughs, tears, love, adventures, special effects, good actors and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, The Wizard of Oz. The hero, Paulie, an intelligent parrot, separates himself from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always keeping in mind his determination to find his friend, Marie. Highly recommended
