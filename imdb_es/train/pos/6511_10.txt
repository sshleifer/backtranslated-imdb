Like many here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here who did it, I love this show! I think it has been very well done and thought. Everything about it marks it as a spin-off that should not be taken seriously. The formula is simple: it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the best out of the good. By using the well-known characters of Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, it is much easier to engage the viewer with the humor of the parody from the beginning of each 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> There has always been a Scooby-Doo spin-off that has annoyed the fans. The classic is the Scooby Shaggy Scrappy short of the 80's. These spin-offs had their place: they allowed new content to be sold, created new fans and kept the Scooby-Doo merchandise on the shelves. I agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a clue!" it does not fit with this traditional role, but it's probably what I always wanted the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts to be: an action-packed show that focuses on the funniest and funniest Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the show: the animation, the voices, the attention to detail, the bad guys, the "best friend" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, the constant humor! Bad features: none, although the renewed Mystery Machine is quite close at times. <br /> <br /> Well done, Warner Bros. Animation! One of the smartest caricatures in a long time!
