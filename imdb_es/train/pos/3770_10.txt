When will people learn that some films are made for fun and not necessarily to change the world? If you realize this, expect to have a lot of fun while watching "Bill and Ted's fake trip". This is a movie that is very fun to watch, Keanu and Alex are a great team on the screen that repeats their characters from "The Excellent Adventure of Bill and Ted" with even more "style" than the first movie. It's not rocket science, but it's great to laugh at, the characters are extremely capable and the plot is so radical that you have to laugh. Do not wait 'deep and meaningful' just wait for pure fun!
