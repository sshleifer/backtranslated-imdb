What a night. Then, Perry Mason Have Gun, Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour) and finally at 10:30 PM came 'Sea Hunt' with its wonderful opening theme music and Mike's ship sailing towards a new adventure. Terrific. Regardless of the story, he was the main character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. The man of a man and the man of a child. This caused an interest in the ships that lasted for years. Why they are not shown on the cable or are not available on video, no idea ... Pity.
