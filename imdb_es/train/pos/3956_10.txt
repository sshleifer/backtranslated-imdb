HUSBANDS BEWARE is a new version of the classic Shemp BRIDELESS GROOM. The new culinary scene of the film at the beginning of the film is great. Crazy people are always fun when they cook. However, after the first few minutes of recording images, we cut out the original BRIDELESS GROOM images. One thing I noticed about these remakes from 1953 to 1956 is that they fit with the new story. They make an insertion shot if the line of the old story does not match. <br /> <br /> HUSBANDS BEWARE has a new ending, but I will not give it to those who want to be surprised. <Br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars.
