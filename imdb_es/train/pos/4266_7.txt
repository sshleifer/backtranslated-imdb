The first time I saw this was half a life on a black and white TV in a small town in Samoa and I found it funny. Now, having seen it a second time, much later, I do not find it funny. I do not find anything funny anymore. But this is an ingenious and joyful comedy that moves quickly without stumbling and I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br /> It's 1945 and Fred MacMurray is a 4F that is dying to get into one of the armed forces. He rubs a lamp in the junkyard he's driving and a genius seems to grant him some wishes. (Oh, yes, right? But although the introduction is only acceptable, the fantasies are quite vivid). MacMurray tells the genius he wants to be in the army. Poof, and he is marching along with the Washington soldiers in a particularly warm and welcoming USO where June Haver and Joan Leslie wear many lace mats or whatever, and lavender wigs. Washington sends MacMurray to spy on the enemy: German-speaking, red-speaking Hessians, not British. The Hessians are stuck in a Bierstube and singing a very funny song that extols the virtues of the Vaterland, "where the white wine is richer / and the Rhinier of the Rhine water / and the sausage is softer / and the yellow hair is more yellow / and the Frauleins are more jucier / and the goose steps are more capricious ". Something like that. The characterizations are fabulous, as good as those of Sig Rumann. Otto Preminger is the suspicious and sinister general of Hesse. "You know, Heidelberg, we have 241-1 against you, but we are not afraid." <br /> <br /> I can not continue with these fantasies for a long time, but they are all quite funny, just like the lyrics. When he wants to be in the Navy, MacMurray ends with Columbus and the fantasy is presented as a great opera. "Do not you know that sailing to the west meant / a tremendously expensive investment? / And who do you suppose the media provides / but Isabella, Queen of Queens?" When they see the New World, someone says that it looks very good. "I do not care what it looks like," Columbus mutters, "but that place will be called Columbusland." <br /> <br /> Anyway, everything is finally fixed, although the genius at this moment is quite drunk, and MacMurray ends up in the Marine Corps with the right girl. <br /> <br /> I've made it look too cute, maybe, but it's cute. Children will enjoy the puffs of smoke and magic and the corny love story. Adults will have fun with the most challenging elements in history (who are the Hessians?) Unless they graduate from college, in which case they may want to stay with the legerdain and say, "Wow! Awesome! "
