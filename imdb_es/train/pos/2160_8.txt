['This film is about a man who has been too ingrained with the accepted convention of success, trying to always be mobile up, working hard to be proud of owning his own home. He assumes that this is all there is in life until he accidentally starts dancing, all because he wanted to see up close a beautiful girl that he sees in the dance studio every day while traveling in the subway on the way home. <br /><br /> He was in love with her at first, going to the dance class just to idolize her, but finally let go and get into the dance. Eventually it becomes evident that there is more to life than working until death. There is a set of strange characters who also learn in the studio, which causes a lot of laughter in the film and a certain sense of union among the dejected. <br /><br /> There are also revelations of several characters, including the girl who initially admired, giving them some depth to show their stained past and their struggle to overcome it. <br /><br /> The dance was also entertaining, with great competition at the end, but it is not the usual story in which our losers come out on top when they win. Instead, there are disadvantages, revelations and redemption. <br /><br /> All this makes it an exciting and fun movie to watch.']
