Any child who is old enough to sit in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this sincere and humorous rewriting of Grimms' fairy tale. They will be singing 'Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo' before they can formulate a complete sentence and will continue to sing it until their last days. It is a classic for all children, especially those adults who are young at heart.
