The strange couple is a comical gem. One of the funniest scripts ever committed to celluloid. Only surpassed by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: obsessive-compulsive Felix and careless and irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife already left him because it is impossible to live with him because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film, and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker partner Oscar. That's when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The entire script is bright and full of bright one-line phrases. You are probably already familiar with the "F.U." joke, but it still works brilliantly due to Matthau's comical timing. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clean his breast in the restaurant and when the Pigeon sisters are being seduced by a very soft Matthau, and Lemmon is totally out of his element. This requires repeat visits!
