['Godard once said that one way to criticize a movie is to make one, and probably the strongest guy that can be made about Ralph Bakshi&#39;s takeover of Tolkien&#39;s masterpiece, Lord of the Rings, was actually made by Peter Jackson. The recent trilogy, for me, are not even total masterpieces, but they are given enough space with each book to breathe all the postmodern techniques crossed with the classic narrative so that they are very good entertainments. <br /><br /> But as someone who has not read the books, I end up now looking at the two versions, live action (albeit partly animated in its form of great visual effects) and animated (though partly made with real live action as a frame) in relation just the basic story, do not even complete fidelity to the books. And with Bakshi&#39;s version, in a way it&#39;s almost not fair, since what we see is not really the complete vision, it&#39;s not what Jackson actually had (probably the final cut). Stolen the return of the great climatic race of the King, and with the other two hurried parts, I ended up liking myself more for what he did within his limitations, although as such, those same limitations make him disappointing. <br /><br /> What is also interesting, after seeing Jackson&#39;s films for the first time, which I also regret a little is that I could have reacted differently when I was younger and before five years ago, is that the basic elements of the story never get confused . Everything that is really needed to tell the story of Fellowship of the Ring is practically intact, and in any case, what was probably even more gigantic and epic in Tolkien&#39;s book is given some clarity in this section. The actors who interpret the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes are more or less suitable for the parts, with some prominent parts (John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squire as Gandalf). <br /><br /> The lack of additional characterization makes things seem a bit of face value for those who have not even seen the other movies or read the books and can not put them in context. But there is a certain level of interest always with the characters, and here there is a more outdated sensitivity in the midst of the great aura of what is more. This is not a variety of Disney adaptation garden, warts and all, this is a Bakshi movie, with its clandestine animation roots colliding with the mythical world of Middle Earth. <br /><br /> And what Bakshi and his animation team contribute to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen, in all its abbreviated form, its success or lack of appeal. In addition to not being completely complete as a movie, or as stories, the shape of the film is an experiment, to see if something can be completely rotoscopied. The results end up bringing what now seems to be retro, but at the time, of course, it was something that was a rough and crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers. Could it have been better with the more traditional drawn animation? In some parts, yes; It becomes a little perceptible, as also happened in Bakshi&#39;s American Pop, that the main characters move in such a way that they are a bit unstable, like a kind of comic made in another way. Still, there is much that I admired in what was done. <br /><br /> The orcs, for example, I found really surprising in their surrealist environment. Perhaps they are the best part of the animation combination at the top of the live action, especially during the parts where there are no battle images (that is really the true section of success or lack, since there is no continuity of the good and the bad rotoscopia), and the chiaroscuro arrives with great forms on top of the horse. It&#39;s spooky in a good way. And the backgrounds, although they are also very rough and, sometimes, too vague, are beautiful with the mixtures and the explosions of colors together. It is almost something for lovers of art cinema as much as for ring nuts. <br /><br /> So, how would you recommend this animated version of the Lord of the Rings? I do not know, to tell the truth. It&#39;s certainly a good category over the other Tolkien animated movie I&#39;ve seen, the Hobbit (and I have not seen the animated ROTK yet), and there&#39;s some real art going on. There are also some forced dialogues, a segment of Dos Torres very hasty, with the most intriguing character that Gollum reduces to perhaps two scenes in total. And seeing something as fragmented as this ends up reinforcing the integrity of the most recent films. <br /><br /> If you are a fan of books that contemplate reading this, I would say it is worth an opportunity, even if it is one of those opportunities where you observe for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. As for what fits the other Bakshi movies, I&#39;ve seen that it&#39;s an ambitious and irregularly impressive achievement, where as with Lynch&#39;s Dune it&#39;s likely that a dark and biting line will be drawn in the sand among those who passionately hate it. and those who do not. t I do not']
