Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either because of their unpleasant nudity (Man Bites Dog) or its sheer violence (most of Peckinpah's films), Deliverance surprises because of its verisimilitude. Certainly, the buggery scene is quite direct in its unpleasantness, but the effect of the film derives much more from its slow buildup and the tangible sense of isolation that surrounds the four drivers, both before and after everything starts go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, which does not even recognize the men with whom he had previously played music, let alone show signs of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister of cinema modern. The tension increases constantly throughout the canoe trip and perseveres even after the final credits; the end makes the meaning of character tests terribly real. The plausibility of the film is greatly favored by the interpretation of the protagonists, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and the reluctant hero, respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better. The cultural influence of the film is demonstrated by the number of people who will understand a reference to the "territory of the banjo", maybe only Get Carter has made such an effective ax job in the tourist industry of a region. I can only think of a handful of movies that put me in such a severe depression after they were over. The oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can imagine. Although much of it is excellent by itself, Deliverance is a classic especially because there are no adequate points of comparison, it is unique.
