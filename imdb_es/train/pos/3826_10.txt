I love Korean movies because they have the ability to really capture real life (silently, disturbingly). I tend to watch Korean movies just for that reason. I have seen this directors other films before. The one that comes closest to the feelings I got from this is Oasis and another amazing movie called This Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> However, my title summary is supposed to be from a Chrstian perspective, so I will start doing that instead of simply filling it with praise. <br /> <br /> For a non-Christian perspective, director Chang-dong Lee has captured an impartial and almost disturbingly real portrait of a modern Protestant church (regardless of its denomination) warts and all. I've always been waiting for a Christian movie that really portrays the darkest corners of church life. Because Christian films tend to speak in a language that is different from those with whom they want to share their faith. Many films with religious nuances, although they have good reasons, tend to have the resonance of a Disney movie or special after school. They need to show life as it is. Real people curse, real people covet, real people fall. And although Christians believe that salvation is available to those who seek it, the daily horrors of this life still challenge us. And the character of Do-yeon Jeon is a totally honest and almost brutal portrait of a woman who found God, but because of the bitter realities of life, she loses that love for Him that she once had. She does not deny that God exists. It's just that she refuses to accept living with the idea that He is a God who loves and forgives. <br /> <br /> In his decent to the limits of morality and madness, his character asks questions that are on everyone's mind, religious or not. <br /> <br /> "If God is love, why do you allow such terrible things to happen?" This movie does not answer that, rightly so. And I think that the last 10 minutes of the film, although open to interpretation, leave us with a hopeful future for our main character and bring the idea of ​​a "circle of secret light". <br /> <br /> I do not. He believes for a second that this movie tried to be religious or somehow he tried and he set out to be that. That is the reason why it worked even more. It's real, it's honest. And because of that, it's by far the best summary of a real Christian life I've seen in a movie.
