Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper movies that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. In fact, I saw it while sailing through Cuba on a cruise through the western Caribbean. It details the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time was spent in the revolution until the end, when the socialist regime arrived and took the properties of the child's father. The majority of the film is the coming of age of the children and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows each other. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A class A movie with good acting and direction. This is a movie that tells a story without special effects, great schemes or real twists. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes and their triumphs. A good movie that is worth seeing several times a year.
