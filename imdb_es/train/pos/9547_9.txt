This film is the first cinematic experience for several people in the cast. All of them are experienced actors and have played in several TV series and plays. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It's a bit strange to see him in a thriller, while he's at the peak of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is the first long shot by Togan Gokbakar and practically the first experience as a director. But everyone did a good job. We are happy to see such an enthusiastic young cast. They seem very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay, who has been Sahan Gokbakar's girlfriend for a long time, is also a talented actress, known for her recent "number 27" theatrical work and several television series.
