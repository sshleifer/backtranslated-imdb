It is not so bad movie ab, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best, we could be with Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint etc. In other words, have the opportunity to spend an hour more in the company of some old friends, from simple to urban, murdering and being killed, always a pleasure in my book. <br /> <br /> Barrie is a tough lady to take revenge and enlighten her framed and dead father, a police detective planning and carrying out with his gang a series of murders of the underworld. What surely would have had the opposite effect! Sanders joins the fun by simply dancing in the right club, in the right place, in the right city, at the right time, with the right lighting on him and the first killer (at the right time!) And killing him. <Br /> <br /> The story and the acting are fine, the only complaint I have is near the end with the hasty and almost laughable discovery of who was the genius of evil (Waldeman): they almost forgot its relevance in the plot? That said, a solid entry in the series.
