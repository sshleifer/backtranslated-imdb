disappeared in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy movie that won more than $ 100 million but was criticized by most critics. Personally I thought that this was a great movie. The story was believable and probably has the biggest cast for this type of film, including the 3 winners of the academy awards, Nicolas Cage, Robert Duvall and the very good Anjolina Jolie. Apart from the lame trick at the end, this is a perfect mix of action comedy and drama. My score is **** (from ****)
