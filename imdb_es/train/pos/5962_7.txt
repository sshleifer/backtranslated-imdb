I've seen a lot of "80 rock horrors" over the years, from garbage like "Terror on Tour" to ridiculously funny gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2". Somehow, I managed to maintain it, which is strange because it is probably the most popular and the most well received. Well, I finally reached it and it's easily the best of this mostly horrible subgenre (but almost always attractive!). The plot (which was largely lifted in the movie "Black Roses") refers to a misfit named Eddie, who was ridiculed by everyone in his high school for his musical taste. He loves the metal of the 80s, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by the late great Tony Fields). After killing Sammi, Eddie's favorite radio DJ gives Sammi the final recording. Once Eddie plays the record backwards, he discovers that it is a little harder, and bad things start to happen to those who make fun of him. Is Sammi's music possessed? "Trick or Treat" is well done and is a total scream. The special effects are impressive, even though they have the typical laser beams of the 80s. I grew up in the 80s, and although I was not a heavy metal fan, I remember the urban legend about playing an upside down CD when listening to the sounds of the worship of Satan. LOL! I also remember that my older brothers and neighbors told me that KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it's really fun to see them both as a harmless radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. I wish I had seen this movie as a child! While the film seems to mock the popular connection in the 80s between the supposed worship of the demon and heavy metal, the viewer never finds out why Sammi Curr is back from the dead causing havoc and killing anyone who gets in his way. path. This is the weakest point of the movie, but if you can ignore it, it's really fun.
