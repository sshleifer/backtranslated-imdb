With Harry Callahan rising in years, the inevitable "old man with a chip on his shoulder" finally had to come into play. Callahan, looking fragile at times and out of place, his behavior was still unwavering. Fortunately, this movie took a while to develop a different kind of story, one that could reinvent dirty Harry and the whole genre. While the film fell short in doing so, it was still an excellent addition to the series, even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music.
