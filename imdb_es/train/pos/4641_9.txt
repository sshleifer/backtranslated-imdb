Eytan Fox did it again: move the heart of the viewer in a modest story that unfolds in an overwhelming disaster. The film also manages to describe in such a perfect and subtle way the atmosphere of the incredible city that is Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago and it's all there: the lifestyle, the relationships, the heart. The city of beats, the disorder, the tangle of utopian mentalities in the megalopolis more carefree, joyful and alien to the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend: it is a journey for the heart and the mind, with an interesting perspective. to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note Bene: There is a gay plot in the movie. If you do not think you're too gay, get ready to be challenged and finally take it as "just love". (and do not worry: the girl is hot too!)
