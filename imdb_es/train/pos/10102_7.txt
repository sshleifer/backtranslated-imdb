I have to start saying that it's been a long time since I've seen it, but I've seen it 5 or more times; a small and wonderful romp that was clearly inspired by the musical comedy pairs of new stars or in fading with prominent musical groups. The mysteries of Kay Kyser would be a good example. <br /> <br /> Having Spike Jones unleashed is the best part of the show, since he and his band play many songs and are part of the action, doing an excellent job of support. Hugh O'Brien plays the face, Buddy Hackett, for the rumor he has, he offered it to Lou Costello and, therefore, Abbott and Costello replaced the leaders. I do not know if that was true. <br /> <br /> in general, a nice movie, but it's important to have Spike Jones and his band in the movie for the story. I wish it was launched, since I have not seen or heard it in two decades. I hope you do not miss
