IN AGREEMENT. There are people who should not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Do not see it if you do not like satire or black humor. 2) You do not like it if you got offended by _The Watchmen_. 3) Do not see it if you want a serious movie of superheroes. <br /> <br /> The rest of you, run, do not walk, to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's peculiar, it's a charming display of all the clich√©s of bad superheroes known to man. Occasional raids on high school humor do not ruin the discreet fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as a couple more fun parts of Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (It's good to see Louise Lasser get a job, too). I laughed all the time. Absolutely not very serious, something weird, but -well-.
