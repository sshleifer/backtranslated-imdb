I love the television show. It got hooked the first time I saw it. I wish I was there acting with them. Touch the reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life, then, in a turn of events, you meet someone else and that person is more of the person you want to be with. You are in a situation where you have to choose one or the other. Someone is going to get hurt, there's nothing stopping him. Making the decision is difficult but, do you want to remain unhappy when you could have been? Why go on and live a life that you thought you wanted or think you're doing right and that both are unhappy? That other person is not going to wait a lifetime waiting, has a good life. Making the decision you really want will be better in the end. Making the best of what you have is something good and good. Money, cars, houses, etc. They do not make you happy, since you have the person you really want to be with to share it.
