This show was absolutely great, and I always hope to see it. All the characters were fun and amazing in their own way, each and every episode provided laughter without stopping, and it was completely entertaining and different from many other programs. . Everyone was absolutely crazy and incredibly funny, so you could not help but love this show. There were some deadweight episodes, but those of the 70 always managed to create a pleasant atmosphere, where they really did not. No matter. This was one of the best programs that have been broadcast, and I will see this program any time I can, as it never gets old, never gets nasty and never stops being interesting.
