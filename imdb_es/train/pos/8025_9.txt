I love this movie. The songs and the lines of the story are very funny. and the song "say goodbye" always moves me. What a brilliant thing to do to bring the puppets to life, in a way that really worries you about these things made of fabric and cloth and whatever. Great voices and great talent. Why all the other muppets movies that came after this one were much less interesting, moving and fun? is that mr. Is Henson so surprised?
