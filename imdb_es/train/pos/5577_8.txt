I had not laughed so much for a movie in a long time. The garbage that Hollywood has been throwing lately makes me climb a wall! This was definitely fresh and witty. If you look at the demographics of the ratings, only a few women have voted! I do not want to ruin the movie for you, but I'm sure every person who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a bad rating, why? Because the movie puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because of its real humor value and not because it hurts men ... it could easily be a movie rated "7"!
