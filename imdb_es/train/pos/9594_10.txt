While many unfortunately passed, the ballroom scene is still very much alive and continues with its legacy. Some are still very alive and pretty well, Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very successful and provides great support to the gay community in general, Pepper Labeija just passed away last year for a natural cause, Let him rest in peace. After the death of Anji, Carmen became the mother of the house of Xtravaganza (she was at the beach scene) and she also looks more charming. Some balls have categories dedicated to those that have passed, that all rest in peace. Currently there is another ongoing project known as "How do I look?" You can check the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
