It's great how this movie drags you. I had honest laughs. I do not care if it's low budget because the thing works for me. To be honest, my wife did not do it the same way, but she prefers a different kind of movie. However, she admitted that she was very creative and well organized and probably all in a shoe chain. These characters whose lives are strange and problematic give me something to relate to in my own world. Just go on and I know who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. When I watched this movie for the second and third time, I realized that there are some hidden moments that happened for the first time. What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity. Anyway, I liked it. I hope to see more.
