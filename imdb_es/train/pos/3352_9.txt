There should be a subgenre in the western called 'Robert Mitchum Western'. Mitchum's bright, idiosyncratic, and generally underrated ones matter to his black movie character to record some convincingly dark character sketches, and bring a weariness to the more familiar elegiac world of Sam Peckinpah's films. "Man with the gun" is one of his best. Directed by the protected Richard Wilson of Orson Welles, it is a raw and monochromatic beauty, full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence, as Mitchum comes to tame a city terrorized by a monopolist with a private army. Mitchum's regression from a strange talker to a crazy killer, with a lot of dark emotions in between, is a wonder of expressive and physical action.
