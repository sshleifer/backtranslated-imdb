I found 'Time At The Top' an entertaining and stimulating experience. The performance, although not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and, sometimes, very good. As a film obviously aimed at young demographics, it is undoubtedly one of the best works in the genre (children's science fiction). Normally, I would say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia produce the best films and television programs for children, and 'Time At The Top' does nothing to discard this theory. I do not think continuity and good acting are important for younger people. A good plot and an imaginative script are much more important to them. Both are in abundance in this movie. Special effects are good, without detracting from the story or driving viewers away from their own imagination. It would have been very easy to inject an SFX overload into this movie, but it would have totally destroyed his 'Raison D'etre'. <br /> <br /> The configuration and work of the camera are of a very high standard in this film and complement the elegant wardrobe and historical precision. In general, this film is highly satisfactory, and I recommend it to all the spectators who can see the world through the eyes of children, or those who try, like me. Now, I really should read the original book, as soon as possible.
