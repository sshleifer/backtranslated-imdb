This movie is such a cheesy kindness. <br /> <br /> A group of people trapped in an abandoned school. They begin to be killed, they know they are being harassed, so what do they do? One girl decides to take a bath, another decides to cheat on her husband (who is also there) with an old boyfriend so that they somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And go to her. <br /> <br /> And it comes with the gore and the T & A. <br /> <br /> And it is also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the usual 80 is a reflection of how we see ourselves, or how adults see young people, or how Hollywood sees the rest of the country, this has a unique perspective. This is a British film made to be an American slasher. It is funny to see the frequency with which the British actors who try to speak "American" involuntarily slide back to their accents of the United Kingdom. <br /> <br /> If you like 80's slashers (like Pieces), then you'll like this one. .
