What do I not like about this movie? Every year you know that you will have one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them will be terrible. This movie is definitely a new new idea that was achieved quite well. A very funny version of a rich young man who pays a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What good is having money like that if you can not do fun things with it? It was a win-win situation. A normal family gets six figures and a rich man experiences Christmas as he imagined. Only if. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly meet their absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie.
