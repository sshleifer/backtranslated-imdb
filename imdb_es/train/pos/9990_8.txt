I saw the movie recently and I liked it a lot. I was surprised and I cried. This film is in the same niche genre as "Away from Her", or even "The Bucket List", but it handles the whole aging issue with an incredible authenticity. It's really hard to have the main character as unpleasant as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar is difficult to understand. Her world has hard edges and she is not a warm and endearing woman. <br /> <br /> The first scene is achieved without any commitment. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home for her son and daughter-in-law. She realizes on the route and is scared. Its edges are very hard. She is bad. She is humble and selfish. She is a stone. I did not like it, not even a little. <br /> <br /> Throughout the course of the film, we obtain information. We discover why he does not like petunias, why he favors one child over the other, how his losses have shaped his character ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to like him. I especially liked when he told his secrets to the boy in the hut. Ellen Burnstyn, you're a brilliant actress. Prestige. Prestige. Prestige. What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a "feel good" movie, but it is certainly a movie that takes the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that the difficult boundaries in a person's life are to protect them, they are there for a reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother, not even my mother. Law or neighbor ... but parts of it are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've seen The Stone Angel.
