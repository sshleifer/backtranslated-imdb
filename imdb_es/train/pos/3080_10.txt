I have complained to ABC about the cancellation of six grades. If enough people do the same, then it could be enough for this fabulous show to come back to life! Simply go to the official site and the rest is quite simple. I do not understand why this show has been canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole concept is exciting to see! I'm surprised that my favorite show has finished after just one series. Why is this? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than many other television shows that exist! Until I found out that they were preventing a friend, it had not even occurred to me that this could happen.
