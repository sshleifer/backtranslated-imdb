The story is told fluently. There are no interruptions. Flash backs are perfectly intertwined in the present. The casting was excellent. The young Ya'ara looked a lot like Ya'ara at that age. His representation of a blind person was convincingly made. The director Daniel Syrkin has done an excellent job to get the different actors to work together in this story. The cinematography is very good. You feel as if you are with Ya'ara and Talia walking towards the ocean to the edge of the cliff. The English subtitles closely follow the Hebrew script. It is interesting to note that although "Out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin" Both names are very appropriate for the story.
