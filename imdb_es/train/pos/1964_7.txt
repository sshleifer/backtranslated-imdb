I can not accept the negative comments of other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I left the cinema feeling happy not to have been influenced by IMDb's critics. 14 hours later I'm still trying to find flaws in the plot, but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to all is to see it for yourself and make your own decision. <br /> <br /> It follows a pattern similar to the Basic Instinct 1 but the plot is less confusing. It still left me thinking at the end but in a more satisfying way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as she used to be and she's been 48 years extremely well; This continues to be its defining role. David Morrisey was satisfactory even though he is not Michael Douglas. From the cast of cast, I especially liked David Thewlis as the detective of the police.
