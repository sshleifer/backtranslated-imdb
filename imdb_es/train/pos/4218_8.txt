['I have not really seen too many Columbo movies ... actually, I think I&#39;ve only seen one or two, apart from this one. However, I&#39;ve always liked Columbo, somehow without even having seen him so much. Peter Falk is and always has been the perfect choice for the character, for his appearance, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that, although the series began in 1968, the last (and probably not the last) of the films was made in 2003. That&#39;s 35 years. And Falk was 40 years ago when he did the first one. The series consists of 68 movies (unless my account is disabled), all made for television. Everyone knows the character, although no one has seen a movie with him at the cinema. That is quite an achievement, if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with this is that the murderer and the murder are revealed from the beginning (although it can be the same for all the Columbo films), leaving no mystery but how Columbo solves it, making it a bit boring (since There&#39;s not much to look forward to at the end of the movie). The pace is good, there is hardly a scene where you are bored. The acting is very good, particularly that of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great exchanges of dialogues in the movie. The characters are well written and they are credible. The dialogue and the script are unusually good for a television movie. In general, the film is, yes, surprisingly good for a television movie, and definitely worth seeing for any fan of Columbo and / or crime / mystery movies. 8/10']
