Warning: contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie and you plan to do it, just stop reading here and trust my word. You have to see this movie. I've seen it four times so far and I still have not decided what exactly happened in the movie. That's all I'm going to say, because if you have not seen this movie, then stop reading right now. <br /> <br /> If you are still reading, I will ask you some questions and maybe if there is someone. Have an answer, you can send me an email and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my 11th grade English teacher very well. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise beyond his years and always had this torturous way of teaching you things that you may not have been very interested in. If we did not like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern romance with modern language so we could understand it. Our classroom was never a room, it was a country house and we were at the lake reading a book in our free time. This was his own indelible way of marking something in our minds like sponges. <br /> <br /> I start this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us a task that has been etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost friend, and finally it gave me some sense after watching The Matrix. Now, if I did not know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher, Mr. Krisak. But by giving them the benefit of the doubt, we will assume that it was not him. But that was the first time that this task was something more than impalpable. <br /> <br /> He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that they were real. Show me how you can say you're real. This made the class spit out all the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. All the pain, the sense of touch, the sensation of loss, the feeling of hunger, were transmitted to our teacher to show him that we were real. After each scenario we gave him, he would return with the only answer that would leave us speechless. <br /> <br /> "What happens if you're just someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> What if you were someone else's dream? What a messy question it is. This was a question / scenario that was raised about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid advancement of computers. How is it possible that it seems then? But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what was part of someone else's dream? <br /> <br /> Another brilliant but surreal film this year, Mulholland Drive, by David Lynch, explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes beyond what any other film could hope for. In short, this is a movie that literally (if you leave it) will leave you breathless of all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, attractive, fair, publicist and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father and, although he has talent and business acumen, his board of governors, the Seven Dwarfs, believes he is a rich drinker with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that they have done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film we find one of David's beautiful toys called Julie Gianni, played with the pernicious but grandiloquent perfection of Cameron Díaz. David and Julie play a good game, both claim that they are only there to be used and that they are not interested in a monogamous and committed relationship. This is the kind of relationship according to the other adventures David has had in the most important sexual moment of his life. And although both speak a good game, we can say that only one is really telling the truth. <br /> <br /> Then we ran into Brian Shelby, who played with a stroke of genius for Kevin Smith's good friend, Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish, but they are also very good friends. This is something that David has very little in his life and you can feel a real mutual concern from the beginning of the movie. Brian has a famous phrase that he always tells David over and over again. And that's "the sweet is not so sweet without the bitter." He goes on to tell her that one day he will find true love and not just this part-time lover's state that he seems to perpetrate with all the floozies that live in his bed one or two nights. <br /> <br /> At David's big birthday party, (so big that some like Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian comes in with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played by course with Penélope Cruz with whom he must be the best performance of this year by an actress. . This is a party only by invitation and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with each other. And in typical David fashion, even though his best friend is there, he starts flirting with Sofia. To complicate things, Julie appears without being invited and begins to spy on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw cartoons of each other. There is no handkerchief. The next day, when David is leaving Sofia's apartment, she is greeted by Julie, who offers her a ride and from there ... well, I think we've all seen the commercials. <br /> <br /> That's all I'll really say about the plot, because from here the movie bothers us with what reality is and the perception blurred. They present us with a character played by Kurt Russel and some other somber characters who play a role in this labyrinth like mist. There is a subtext of death and possible cure-as a panacea that may or may not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the fascinating possibilities that the film offers us, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> As many films seem to thrive today, this movie has a secret. Sixth Sense may have started this madness, but look even further back and you may be able to thank Angel Heart for starting the madness. Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of its own surreptitious burners. And what makes this so much fun is that the movie gives you many obvious clues along the way, but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the glove of truth and lies that you just went through. I've seen this movie four times and I've always done it because I want to see if there's anything else I can capture, something else I can understand. Being able to work your mind in the theater, allowing it to open up to new possibilities is something weird in a movie. All ersatz called "Best photos of the year" have been good, but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a movie that leaves you wanting more and still guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those who made it care about it. I know that this film has received mixed reviews, but I think those who do not like it do not understand it well. <br /> <br /> This is what cinema is supposed to do. This is what a movie should do with you. It's supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. This one is not. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 The best movie of the year. I would love to see this nominee for best film and I would love to see Cruz as the best actress, Diaz for his best support, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe for the best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should also be there. None of this can happen, and that's a shame. This is a movie that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> And on a final note, I'm pretty sure Mr. Krisak would like this movie and maybe this is the only movie that can answer your question. Can you prove that you are real? Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for the fun of another person? This is a movie that generates more questions than answers. And I'm sure that's fine with him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
