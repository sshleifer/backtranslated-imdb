When I was six years old, I learned about a series called "The Champions", and even though I was just a kid, I did everything I needed to convince my parents to let me see "The Champions" and "The Avengers" once a week. . . I think that was the series of the Golden Age of English ... (I already have the complete cycle of "The Prisoner"!) But I also lasted a few years later with "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch" ( I'm alone, or this is "Harry Potter" in the girl, of course, before.As much as I want "The Campions" to be in Zone 1 or in Zone 4, I'm also waiting for "Dr. Who" (package of the whole series in a set of, uhm, maybe 300 DVDs, please, I could not spend more on that, 8), "People of Tomorrow", and several others 'low budget', but there are excellent stories available within my areas reached speak and understand English, but not all my relatives, including my parents, who introduced me to these great stories ... I hope that someday, someone can feel the appeal of these series and then sell them as I see them originally, dubbed or subtitled, but in the same format that I saw them, remember, Zone 1 or 4 are fine with my TV viewfinder!
