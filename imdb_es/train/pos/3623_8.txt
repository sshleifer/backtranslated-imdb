Disney could be in something here. First, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on truth that involves sports and a small city in the middle of America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie ... another sports story based on the truth. <br /> <br /> Both movies make you cry sometimes, and both make you smile and feel good after watching them. My wife and I saw The Rookie and we hope it's a great sensation movie. We were not disappointed, when they asked us if we would buy this on a DVD when it came out, it was not obvious. Definitely
