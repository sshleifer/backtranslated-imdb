Henri Verneuil represented commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980. Always strong at the box office, and usually telling dramatic and suspense stories about casino robberies, mafia arrangements and World War II battles, you can count on Verneuil to give us two hours of entertainment on Saturday through night. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his time: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. It is a strangely static film, which is mainly made in offices and conference rooms, which does not contain a scene of persecution and almost no violence. <br /> <br /> Montand offers a good performance, although somewhat dry, and is well supported by the other actors I could not help but wonder what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story, based on Z (the murder of Lambrakis) and L'aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by the Stalinists).
