I used to write comments in IMDb, but I do not do it anymore. It happens that IMDb has become massive and, consequently, subjectivity has ruined scores. What do I want to say? That anyone who is not particularly fond of movies and has no experience in the subject, see some shit (or otherwise), and if you like it, give a 10, and if you do not, go for a 1. This, of course, can not measure anything correctly. Now for the movie. I really regret having given 10s to some very few films, because then I must write this with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something that I do not expect to see again in my life in any other movie. It's simply fascinating, and it's not just a way of saying; really is. The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual joy and wisdom, the words spoken by the protagonists, that really ... there is no possible match. I do not keep movies, it would seldom make sense to do it, but this is the kind of movie you should buy and save, and look from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as the years go by. I have nothing else to say. This is a real goal for me.
