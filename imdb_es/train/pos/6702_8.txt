['Although there are no new episodes, and rarely shows. I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I could never see the last episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why did the aunts have to disappear from the show forever? I&#39;m sure the end was perfect. But there are many unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of STTW! Because I heard that she decides between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I really hope she chooses Harvey! And I can say that Nate Richart is HOTT! Although it&#39;s too bad, it&#39;s too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of tenderness that adds to the show, but there are many &quot;stupid&quot; things for the show, like the famous bands that come out of nowhere and play songs and the whole cast listens, it&#39;s like stupid. Also, the cat starts to get really silly, as the show went on, the jokes started to go stupid and the things that the audio controlled the &quot;audience&quot; would laugh at, I would think it was very bad. Do not get me wrong, in some places it was funny, but I think the show lost its &quot;magic&quot; so to speak as the show went on. Although I congratulate the entire cast for trying, although that Soleil Moon Frye girl did not like it, and was a horrible actress. I wonder what Melissa is doing or any of the actors now, now that the show is over.']
