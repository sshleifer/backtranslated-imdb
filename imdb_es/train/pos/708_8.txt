A good movie about downs syndrome. A mother has twins, one is very sick, the other is good, but has problems. The mother does not believe that she can raise it, so she gives it to some people who have 15 children and 11 have problems! Mom does not like this and she thinks he should be with his family (I also agree), so they take him to court and the family breaks up and grandparents lose, does he never really say if mom and daughter are makeup? I think this movie is good, but the plot is familiar, it's still good and it has some involuntary laughter.
