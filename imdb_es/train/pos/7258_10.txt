I was lucky enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and I've seen it a second time. The first time I went out at night on TV in Australia more than 20 years ago, but I could never forget this strange and somber movie .. <br /> <br /> Not many people like this movie because it is so little conventional: The fact that there are almost no dialogues spoken in this movement (we only listen to the thoughts of the characters) is only an unconventional aspect. <br /> <br /> Looking for a copy of this movie, I discovered that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, it was not stored in any television or movie archive in the UK, it was never posted on video or DVD, which was destroyed by television networks around the world after their copyright ran out in the 1980s. When it was first broadcast on television in Australia, there were no recordable devices for consumers. <br /> <br /> In the second time I saw it, I could see why it was unforgettable. Sometimes it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic like a play by Harold Pinter. <br /> <br /> Again, if someone wants a copy of this DVD, send me an email and I'm sure we can fix it.
