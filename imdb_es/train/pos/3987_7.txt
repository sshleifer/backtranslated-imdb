Mother is one of those films that you know is good, maybe even great, but it's like eating vegetables or doing math tasks for a child: a lot of work and a lot of pain to invest. <br /> <br /> The story is potentially unpleasant in many ways: the death of a character in the first half hour, the romance from December to May, the idea of ​​a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his mistress with his mother, the collection of weak and quite unpleasant thirty-something characters, the apparent indifference of adults towards children in their lives. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but it is a release to a collection of British films (usually made for television) of the late 80's: it has a moral severity that never ceases, which produces an overwhelming throbbing anguish. <br /> <br /> The mother is impeccable, but that is partly the problem; If a film that deals with so many delicate subjects has some flaws (inconsistencies in the script, some minor actors), it moves away, but if such a film is so perfect, the experience of seeing it is raw and painful. Even the technical qualities (lighting, editing, etc.) make the viewer feel uncomfortable; The London in this film is bright and open, full of hard and sharp light. <br /> <br /> If you're hard like nails, or are one of those super sensitive people who like to torture themselves with a tear. Sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy La Madre. Anyone who is in the middle, forget it or prepare to writhe. And be careful: no matter how hard the film is from beginning to end, the worst is yet to come. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to recover. for this (for having slept with her boyfriend), and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and that she would like to hit him. The mother agrees with this, both get up and, instead of a well-prepared slap, the daughter clenches her fist and throws the blow of a boxer. Argh!
