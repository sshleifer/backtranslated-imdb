"Girlfight" is much more a coming-of-age story than a fight movie. And what a relief to have one in an urban school, with realistic and realistic Latinos and a credible use of the Brooklyn project configuration. <br /> <br /> It made me realize that virtually all of Hollywood's high school movies are located in suburban or small luxury cities. (Even "Love and Basketball," something similar, which focused on African-American teenagers, was established in the suburbs.) While these children share some of the same problems with their peers, those problems are reduced compared to other struggles of these children, where high school graduation could be the greatest achievement of their lives. <br /> <br /> The feminist element here is fascinating in its originality, as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship, and a victory, on your terms. . A large amount of sympathy from the audience goes to the guy who faces the challenge of reaching a situation of expectations of gender flex. <br /> <br /> The movie creeps a little here and there, but this is not a cheap emotion "Rocky" movie fight, since practices and fights have complex results, and all relationships, especially with parents and father figures, take more prominence than the central ring. <br /> <br /> In the end there were many interesting musical credits, but I really had not noticed the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 10/7/2000)
