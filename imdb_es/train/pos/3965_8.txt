The film as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty, with turns co-starring Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by the legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly examined and the approval of the script, as well as all aspects of the film, even the clothes, was closely watched and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. It's not that J. Edgar Hoover did not have something to be proud of. His management of the office from 1924 until his death was based on the best research services in the world. But in 1959, Hoover was already beginning to worry about being expelled and had already begun collecting reports on powerful people to secure and protect their small kingdom. And I was determined to make sure that no movie showed even a single wart on the desk. The film shows only continuous successes and glosses about the failures that occurred, and the role of the bureau in the witch hunt of the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with the tongue firmly on the cheek.
