I was not quite sure what to expect with this, other than the positive reviews I have read. It turns out that I could never have imagined this film, because it is very similar to "The bride with white hair" for being operatic and dealing with the fantastic. This marks a fine line between being a farce, a comedy and simply telling ghost stories in the old way. There is nothing scary, that is not the issue, it is really a love story about a clumsy boy who meets a beautiful ghost, who has many problems with other ghosts. So the main issue is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. This also takes place in ancient China, with extravagant exhibitions of Kung Fu and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the stop action ghosts are pretty good, and the visual effects are of the highest quality. I could see this genre of Chinese movies all day, because they are very entertaining, excellent images and quite ironic. And I'm looking forward to seeing the first sequel to this movie too. Highly recommended
