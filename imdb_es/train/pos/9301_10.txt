['Originally I saw this very dark comedy about 2000 or more on cable television. What a surprise and delight! Everyone is covered in this movie! Dreyfuss interprets the gift &quot;mental&quot; (do you remember the New Yorker who was supposed to be a schizophrenic? Art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are at their best and NOT to play with them! Demonstrating that beauty and endurance go together! Then there&#39;s the big &quot;shit&quot; scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey), where they verbally confront the &quot;shit&quot; of the world. This film is both subtle and bald. For all the filming, it can be a very quiet movie. And, you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or almost final roles. Joey Bishop Richard Pryor. Henry Silva It is not a movie for everyone. But, if you like a movie that has many word games and keeps moving without exploding everything in sight, this is the movie for you. Roger Ebert is shot in this movie. He is completely wrong. THIS is a good movie! Maybe only one for Ebert. I consider it a 10 because of how good it is made and how fun the script can be, while it is not really a kind of comedy film. I like it so much that I bought it on DVD because it does not show much on cable TV. Now, it&#39;s all mine!']
