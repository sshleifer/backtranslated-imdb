The story is about Jet Li, who has to fight against his old friends <br /> <br />. But there is a problem: friends are super fighters. The movie is full of blood, super action and the best acrobatics forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-actor. Of course, the movie has the typical HK-Fun. But I love it! In Germany "Black Mask" is uncut.
