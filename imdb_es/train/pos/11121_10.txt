As a guy who has watched every season, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. I mean, after you saw him go from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture made you believe he's a gangster, you thought: well, he's a good actor and he can get into the skin of a gangster. . But after seeing him opening his eyes and fighting for his life, I want to say that he could almost feel the pain that "made" us believe that he was going through. I was so moved by his performance that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more. But nowadays they are old or dead (Brando) and it is good that they make fewer films and that their performances are "lighter" than they used to be. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other films where he plays a totally different role. Can you recommend me some of his older films in which he offers a memorable performance?
