I was absolutely impressed by the opening night of John Cassavetes. It's the first movie of his that I've seen that seems to be on a larger scale, so it feels more common, but it still does not feel as if it had been grounded as it has in his previous films. That is perhaps what makes it so intense. Without a doubt, there is also something cathartic about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It is about what, in fact, Cassavetes has become a staple of his career, an ideal he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front. The character of Rowlands, the middle-aged actress Myrtle Gordon, can not play her role in the next production as written, so she does not calculate impulse after impulse, resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage, until who finds the right one It is a boldly abstract premise. <br /> <br /> This is a film that does not stop capturing the innate direction that one goes through during an emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things she does, and she looks and even presents herself as something destructive, although it might be the best thing for her. It can be a cleaning instead of a breakdown. A withdrawal, a cocoon, a rebellion, everything culminates in a collapse. Cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch, which is that from the beginning she is fervently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character, however, she is silent, but emotionally corrupts the fear that the opposite is true . <br /> <br /> The last scene, the climactic performance that Myrtle shares with a character separated from her that is acting with her, is one of the most interesting, funny, compelling, illuminating and enjoyable moments I have seen in a movie.
