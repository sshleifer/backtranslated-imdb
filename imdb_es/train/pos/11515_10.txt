Many years have passed since I saw this, but I feel compelled to defend this gem against those who try it. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinions here. That's what humor supposes. It is subjective. Or charge through your curious bone at 60,000 volts or it leaves you cold and you wonder why you gave it time. <br /> <br /> This show has some of the best British comic actors gathered in a story that is silly and funny. irreverent and the result is hilarious. Dialogue and visual comedy are beautifully delivered and the two protagonists (Cleese and Lowe) are excellent together. This was done for them. <br /> <br /> I really can not say anything but implore you to find this and look at it. You will not be disappointed and in a world devoid of gentle humor, this is a classic and harmless piece of comical brilliance.
