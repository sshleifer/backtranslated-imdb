'The Luzhin defense' is a good movie with good central performances, but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker's art shines. In most of the film it was felt that the characters simply helped to drive the narrative. Marlene Gorris might have examined Luzhin's psyche, instead of representing him as a tortured and innocent victim torn by the cruel motives of others. <br /> <br /> Adapting literature to the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a difficult task. Novel written at the beginning of the 20th century. This film does not delve deeply into the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's break with her mother finds a rude disagreement on the part of the mother rather than a dramatic flash point in the film. I felt that I went through the torment of Luzhin and its eventual tragic end, without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unraveled. However, this was a moving and enjoyable movie, but it certainly is not a great movie.
