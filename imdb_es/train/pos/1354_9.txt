For people interested in business and the corporate world, this show is simply the best of the best. As one of the former contestants of the program wrote on his blog about this innovative program: People in business finally had an audience. The whole idea is perfect; have a group of entrepreneurs competing with each other in tasks related to business, located in the best place in the world, the city of New York. Donald Trump is perfect as a boss, even though his ego is bigger than the entire universe to infinity. It also makes many questionable decisions about who to dismiss, which is one of the negative aspects of the program. <br /> <br /> Season 1: Great season in general, the best season of the "normal". This season was the one that focused more on real commercial skills. Later, the series almost drowned in tasks related to marketing with too many product locations. Great and interesting contestants in general, with the most sympathetic character in this series: Troy. I know that I am not the only person who suspects that the episode of Trump World Tower in which he was fired was designed so that Amy and Nick win this particular task. <br /> <br /> Season 2: Also a great season. The tasks were still pretty good, and I had many interesting contestants. Jen M was terrible and should never have reached the final, OMI. Also, this season he had the worst dismissal (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: Terrible. Actually, I liked the smarts vs. book concept street smarts, but the cast was so terrible (it turned out that Trump also hated the cast) that the whole season was a total disaster. The best moments were the second episode (renovation of a motel), with Prime Minister Brian fired, a guy who added nothing but a lot of comedy value. <br /> <br /> Season 4: An excellent season, in large part due to the interesting and entertaining participants of this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and the total disaster whose name was Toral). The episode "Take me to the boardroom" is one of the absolute classics of this show, which ends with the well-remembered fourfold dismissal. Unfortunately, I think we were robbed for the final of Randall vs. There. I think Trump was afraid that she could have won, and prevented that from happening. <br /> <br /> Season 5: A boring season without really anything special. Brent was just a shame and obviously he was just there to create drama. In general, the tasks were terrible (how does creating a jingle have anything to do with the business?). I guess the best man won, but personally I did not care. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I can see why they wanted to try Los Angeles as a new place for the show, but looking back it was. a mistake. New York will always be the place for this. This season he added so many new things, most of them terrible (like losing the team that has to sleep outside in tents, earning PM is still PM, for example). The tasks were terrible and Trump also chose the wrong winner. James deserved it, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Celebrity edition. The best season in history. Rules totally different (like the use of rolodexes), but all fun and entertainment. The biggest problem was that many of the participants were not real celebrities at all, especially the women in which they were all unknown to me, except Omarosa, which is a total disgrace to everything in which she participates. This seemed to be Gene Simmon's season, but after he became a complete fool of himself during Kodak's assignment, another man emerged from the shadows: Piers Morgan. No one has ever dominated a season like he did. He crushed his opponents and also encountered a guy with a great sense of humor (although some tense Americans (of course, not everyone misunderstands me) did not have the social skills to understand it). WAY TO GO PIERS !! <br /> <br /> For fans of this, I recommend the UK version starring Sir Alan Sugar as the boss. In fact, the British version is much better, and that says something, since the American (and original) really is a great show. One thing about the UK version is that participants usually tend to behave like decent human beings in the boardroom, unlike the constant shouting and rude behavior that takes place in the American version.
