['One night, I came home late and turned on the television to see Siskel and Ebert summarizing their choices for the week. I did not hear anything about &quot;Red Rock West,&quot; except two thumbs up and I saw it before he left. He would not stay in theaters for long because of the dealer&#39;s money problems and lack of promotion, but they said he deserved better. <br /><br /> The following afternoon, I followed his advice. They were right, it was some of the most fun I&#39;ve had in the movies. As some readers point out, there are some holes in the plot and the last 10 minutes seem to never end. But it&#39;s worth it, for the fine craftsmanship that was done in the first hour. It&#39;s the best role I&#39;ve seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems perfectly chosen. Dennis Hopper goes almost over, which becomes silly, but reinforces how well everything else works. Sets and music contribute greatly to almost every scene. <br /><br /> When I rented it later for my family, it did not work so well. The long scenes that created tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate, with distractions in the home. It deserves all your attention; turn off the phone, make sure you are not disturbed, watch and listen to each scene, especially at the beginning.']
