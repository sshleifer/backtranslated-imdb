I've always liked this movie from the cover of the video. Finally, I decided to buy it for five dollars in a sale and, what a movie! A simply impressive performance of the whole case and it is filmed in a very beautiful way. Even sometimes from a distance, so you can barely hear what dialogue is, as if you were really at that distance picking up fragments of the story. It is really moving, often funny and very visible. There is not much dialogue, but it is filmed in such a way that you feel so agitated. 9/10 on my part. You must see it.
