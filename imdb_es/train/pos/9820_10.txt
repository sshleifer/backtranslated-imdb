['This is a very good movie made for TV. It represents problems in the suburbs around 1970 and the type of neighbors that one does not want to have. The worst and most annoying part of the movie was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog. The teenagers do everything possible to annoy and harass this poor family. But boy, does the main character take revenge on those punk teenagers at the end? The father / owner surely does not take all the aggravation of punk teenagers lightly and rushes to retaliate after the lack of help from the police. He confronts them and protects their home and family. A very good actor ... I could add. <br /><br /> I saw him on television when he was 8 or 9 years old. I never saw him again on TV and I would like to. Definitely a good one! It&#39;s the kind of movie you can see on a weekday night very late at night and you can not stop watching it or an afternoon movie on a weekend. It&#39;s the kind that you just do not show anymore. <br /><br /> Definitely worth seeing!']
