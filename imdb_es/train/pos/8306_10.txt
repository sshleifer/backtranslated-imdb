In fact, they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to play Little Richard than Leon. He captures Little Richard to a more believable essence. The outfits were wonderful and anyone who watches this movie will definitely keep a smile on his face throughout the film. Although the movie is a bit long, keep your attention with Little Richard's personality and attire in mind. The ending should have taken the direction of bringing Little Richard closer to the present, where you could see him as he has aged in this new millennium. He will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll as far as I'm concerned, regardless of what the other media say.
