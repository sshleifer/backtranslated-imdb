['&quot;Lion King 1 1/2&quot; is Disney&#39;s funniest non-theatrical premiere. I recently saw this movie again after not having seen it in many years. I remember that the first time I saw it I had no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by this entertaining and entertaining movie. <br /><br /> Is it better than &quot;Simba&#39;s pride&quot;? In many ways, yes. Although &quot;Simba&#39;s Pride&quot; was not exactly bad, it did suffer some problems: the lack of a good script and the bad characterizations, which made the impact of what otherwise would be a good movie. <br /><br /> Anyway: it&#39;s nice to see the personalities of Timon and Pumbaa come back to flourish the way we (or indeed me) love each other in this film; in &quot;Simba&#39;s Pride&quot; they were completely annoyed and I did not like the &quot;Timon and Pumbaa&quot; series either. <br /><br /> This movie could easily have been stupid, but fortunately the filmmakers did not take the wrong turn and instead focused on making this film sometimes extremely hilarious. There are some jokes that adults can enjoy alone. The score is pretty good. There are two new songs, which are catchy and two new characters, the mother of Timon, (played by the recognizable Julie Kavner of Marge Simpsons) and Uncle Max, which are nice. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa is movingly shown. The emotional scenes are well integrated into the comic story and do not feel out of place, which could easily have been done (especially in comedies). <br /><br /> But is there anything that distracts this image from getting 10 votes from me? Yes there are. Although, fortunately, they do not have much impact, but I will mention them: 1. Many of the scenes from the first movie are used in this one. Personally, it was strange to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones. <br /><br /> 2. During the climax, some of the jokes become lame. <br /><br /> 3. In the sense of history, this is the story of Timon and although the filmmakers try to integrate their story with that of Simba, sometimes the script feels a bit rushed. <br /><br /> But hey, those details do not impact this otherwise funny movie. It&#39;s the only really acceptable Disney sequel, which should be in every movie collection.']
