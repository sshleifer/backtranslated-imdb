The title of this film does not make much sense, until you see it working, because it is the sound that makes a young man behind while operating his imaginary shopping cart, which is what he does all day. And he is just one of the many strange characters in this surreal and, at times, tragic tale of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drunks who exchange wives, there is a man with aspirations of being an architect, and his little son whom he sends to ask for food. There is a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity in everything that happens around him, and there is a business man with some severe nervous tics who has a wife who treats him (and everyone else) as trash. <br /> <br /> There is no particular plot for this, in reality, they are a lot of stories that deviate from each other, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. In general, I thought it worked pretty well, and I had been dying to see this for a long time just because of its description. I was not disappointed in the least, and I would definitely recommend this. 9 out of 10.
