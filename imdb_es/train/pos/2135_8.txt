Shall We Dance is an excellent film because it shows how something, like dance, can rejuvenate the flow of life in the human spirit. <br /> <br /> Dance is seen as the expression of existence and the birth of individuality. He is certainly the case with Aoki. At work he is a humble office worker, but place him on the dance floor and release all of his bottled intensity. Surprisingly, this version is frowned upon in Japan, due to the rigid culture of conformity. At the beginning of the film, all the characters feel ashamed or afraid of their desire to dance. They will be despised, or considered perverted, for expressing their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face for days.
