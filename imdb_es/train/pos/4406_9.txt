Oddly enough, this movie never made it to the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the release of the video. My expectations were high, but in no way disappointed. As always, with Ang Lee there is a fantastic performance, an intelligent and exciting plot that makes you guess until the end and an excellent film. Along with Unforgiven, this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90s. <br /> <br /> People who expect something like Mel Gibson in The Patriot (corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be sourly disappointed, everyone else who appreciates the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time observing it. 9 out of 10.
