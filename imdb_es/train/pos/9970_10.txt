The brilliant use of exaggerated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of current Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa and Pedro summarize the behavior of the society looking through a telescope) is unique (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although it was subtle, stole this theme in his film "Pierrot le-fou") . Highly recommended!
