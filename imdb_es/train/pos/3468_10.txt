I really liked that movie! I hesitated to see it at the beginning because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when they shot John. However, seeing "Two of us" took me to a happier time when I was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think the writer did an incredible job of describing what "could have been". Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and faced the challenge head on. I was impressed by his accent and manners. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite credible as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene, which was so moving. The movie left me with sadness and satisfaction, which I consider appropriate, given the circumstances.
