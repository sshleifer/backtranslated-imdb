I recently saw this movie and enjoyed it a lot. It provides insight into the creation of independent films and the amount of work really involved when you have a low budget but you need an actor / actor name so that people, anyone can come and see the film. Bobby Myeres played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder make an excellent combination to find the eccentric Miachel Bates, an actor of "NAME" played by Alan Bates that was a perfect decision for the casting in the film and for the film. My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan played by gorgeous and underestimated Debra Kara Unger with her own special performance again in the movie inside the movie. If you like to think when you see a comedy, this is for you. The low budget is combined with the lowest budget with high laugh content.
