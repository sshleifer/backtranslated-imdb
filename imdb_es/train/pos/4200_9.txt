The collection of Samuel Fuller in South Street is anomalous: a film of "red fear" without hysteria, in which the communist threat is not more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark frees the loose woman Jean Peters from her wallet with a strip of microfilm; Without the knowledge of any of them, it holds vital secrets for the Cold War. Peters, by chance, was under the surveillance of FBI agents who are as baffled by the theft as the man who runs it, the cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley. When trying to recover the beautiful film, both sides have the help of Thelma Ritter, an old street Jane who is always in the ear and ready to sell what she hears. <br /> <br /> Fuller is based on an opulent palette of tempos and tones to tell the story, which becomes a race against the clock of increasing brutality. From the subway to the waterfront, your summer in Manhattan takes on a sweaty glow that is almost spicy. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mix of tumultuous and tender, and qualify as "Again," a song presented by Ida Lupino in Road House, also starring Widmark. The rhythm diminishes for the scene of the death of Ritter, beautifully written, among the most moving vignettes of the whole world, and a kind of oasis of mirage in a sentimental film. This is the only work of writer / director Fuller in the stricter confines of the black cycle; His latest explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld, USA) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street.
