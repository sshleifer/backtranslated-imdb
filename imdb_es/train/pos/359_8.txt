I can not believe I just watched this movie. I think maybe I thought it was another movie about the mistreatment of slaves, and I avoided Roots for the same reason, just as I have not seen Schindler's List yet. I do not want to be "entertained" by other people's pain, no matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> So I guess the most important thing I noticed about The Color Purple was that it was not about blacks being abused by whites. Blacks were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters, or of delivering them to be treated as slaves by their "husbands". It was painful to see it, but everyone redeemed themselves in the end, and the performance was phenomenal! I could not believe the character that Oprah played at the age of 35! And, to begin with, I love Whoopi, it was incredible. I'm so glad that I felt bad yesterday afternoon and Showtime was running The Color Purple.
