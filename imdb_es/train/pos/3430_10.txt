I captured this at a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and I was in Awe for the absolute power that this film has. It is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the army in the hope that they will protect and serve our country with honor and will be taken care of by our government. The film details the psychological changes that take place in the training camp when the soldiers become "murderers for their country" and they get into the war and the side effects once they return home. It also portrays the effect that murder has on the human psyche. He pays tribute to soldiers and never criticizes soldiers unlike other films, instead criticizing a system that is not prepared and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of returning veterans. <br /> <br /> This movie is powerful, moving, emotional and stimulating. It is a call to arms to support our troops, not only by buying stickers and going to parades, but also by listening to them and helping to support a change in the way their health and well-being is taken care of after the killing ends. <br /> <br /> The best film of the Festival so far, **** / ****
