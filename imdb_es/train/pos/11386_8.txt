An American In Paris is an integrated musical, which means that songs and dances combine perfectly with the story. The film was inspired by the orchestral composition of 1928 by George Gershwin. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is interspersed with numbers of dances with a choreography by Gene Kelly and set in the popular songs of Gershwin. Songs and music include "I Got Rhythm," "S Wonderful," and "Our love is here to stay." He set a new standard for the subgenre known as the musical "songbook" with dozens of Gershwin songs buried in the underscore. The highlight is the ballet "The American in Paris", an 18-minute dance with Kelly and Caron set in Gershwin's An American in Paris, with an impressionist period dreamed of the style of several painters, is one of the dance sequences uninterrupted Hollywood. movie. Only the ballet cost more than half a million dollars, an amazing sum at that time. <br /> <br /> It's funny to think that a work of art like this is born in a game of billiards between the film producer Arthur Freed (SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN, THE WIZARD OF OZ, IN THE CITY, I MEET IN SAN LOUIS AND THE WAGON OF THE BAND) and Ira Gershwin. Freed's idea was to buy the title so he could use it in a film about Paris and Gershwin's idea that he would only use Gershwin's music. <br /> <br /> The original cast was Cyd Charisse, but she found out she was pregnant. Before starting the shoot. One of the main reasons why Gene Kelly suggested Leslie Caron as a female lead was because she felt that this film needed a "real" French girl who played Lise, not just an American actress who plays one. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while on vacation in Paris, where he saw her perform in a ballet. When he received the call for an audition, he said: "Who is Gene Kelly?" According to Leslie Caron, her introductory dance sequence, which included a seductive dance with a chair, was considered too suggestive by some censors. Gene Kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences that are shown as she introduces herself to Lise. <br /> <br /> Vincente Minnelli first looked for Maurice Chevalier in the part of Georges Gu√©tary, and 'Celeste Holm' in the part of 'Nina Foch'. <Br /> <br /> Minnelli was an innovative musical director with Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), An American in Paris and The Band Wagon (1953). He used color and songs in a way that had not been used before. I used space and time imaginatively. Best of all, however, he allowed himself to free himself from the long ballet sequences that end with all his films. The ballet in An American in Paris may be your best work. <br /> <br /> Even though Vincente Minnelli is recognized as the sole director, he was sometimes tied with his divorce from Judy Garland and other management projects, leaving Gene Kelly to assume the management duties. <br /> <br /> Other highlights include Guetary's interpretation of "Stairway to Paradise"; Oscar Levant's fantasy of directing and performing the Gershwin F Concert (see why he was Oscar Levant's favorite). <br /> <br /> The ballet sequence, now that we know it was a success, everyone now wants to take credit. , Freed, Minnelli, Kelly ?? But before the film was completed, the MGM office in New York said not to spend half a million dollars on a ballet. So Freed went to the studio head, Louis B. Mayer, and he accepted, New York said no. Finally, Gene Kelly showed the New York office how a British film, THE RED SHOES, used a long ballet sequence and that film became a worldwide success. and even today it is considered the premium example of a successful art film. Well, the financiers finally gave in and signed the checks. <br /> <br /> There was an interruption in production after November 1, 1950, at which time Gene Kelly began rehearsing the choreography of the ballet. When the production of that final sequence resumed on December 6, Vincente Minnelli had finished directing another film, The Little Divider of the Father (1951). <br /> <br /> Irene Sharaff designed a style for each of the sets of ballet sequences, reflecting several French impressionist painters: 'Raoul Dufy' (the Place de la Concorde), Edouard Manet (the flower market ), Maurice Utrillo (a street in Paris), Henri Rousseau (the fair), 'Vincent van Gogh' (the Place de l'Opera), and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (the Moulin Rouge). The funds took six weeks to build, with 30 painters working non-stop. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert said after seeing the recent restoration: "An American in Paris has many qualities, including the famous ballet production number, with Kelly and Leslie Caron, which symbolizes the whole history of his courtship in dance ". An American in Paris is often compared to SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN in that it is the best musical ever made, and a critic expressed it best when he said: "SINGIN' IN THE RAIN makes me happy and An American In Paris makes me feel good. " The ballet represents the fantasies of Kelly as represented by the great French artists (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Dufy) that he admires. Organizing a screening for the then sick Raoul Dufy, the actor and producer crouched down to the final credits. There, relieved, they found the artist, moved to tears, requesting a second part of the sumptuous end. <br /> <br /> The film was also the first to win a Golden Globe Award for Best Picture (comedy or musical). .) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly received an honorary Academy Award that year for "his versatility as an actor, singer, director and dancer, and specifically for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography in film" . It was his only Oscar.
