The person who wrote the review "is enough with sweat and spit" has no idea what culture, literature or psycho-criticism is. He rejects Zizek's interpretations because they do not seem to be "in line" with what the director originally intended. And that? The importance of a director's (or author's) intention is not important in critical theory. This is known as the "intentional fallacy" of the author and should be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy A text or a movie CAN be analyzed through various theories, many of which do not agree with each other, as well as completely ignore the intention of the author. This is the most fundamental idea of ​​critical theory. <br /> <br /> Because of this, whoever wrote the text wall lost a lot of time and effort in insulting Zizek. In fact, anyone who studies theory would immediately discredit the opinion of this type (I suggest you do too), since it is completely out of place. <br /> <br /> That said ... If you are interested in the Freudian, Laconian, or Kristevian discourse, this movie is a must. Connect these theories with the popular movie, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking them.
