"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my 5 favorite movies. The dialogue and the acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, romantic Vienna, introduced into the film does not exist (you will not find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it is not possible to reach all places in a single night, either (especially if you are a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). But that is not the point. The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not realistic at all. Although, nothing ever happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being "Titanic" or something like that. Even if you do not like love stories, you should watch this movie. I'm a bit skeptical about the sequel that will debut in summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.
