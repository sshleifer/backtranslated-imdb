Surprisingly well done for an independent film, An Insomniac's Nightmare paints a striking picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Wonderfully well written, and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream while the viewer spends a night in the life of an insomniac. <br /> <br /> Starring Dominic Monaghan as Jack, we can see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on. The narration is almost hypnotizing, and from the initial lines, it is impossible to reject it. Fascinating and a little unsettling, it shows how someone manages with lack of sleep, balancing between sanity and insanity. <br /> <br /> With twists and turns on every corner, An Insomniac's Nightmare is provocative and appealing. It comes highly recommended.
