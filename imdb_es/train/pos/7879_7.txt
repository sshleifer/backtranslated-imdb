As with most of Eleanor Powell's films, it develops along the weakest frames. For some reason - oh it's explained! - It is selected to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. The good and the bad compete for the mine and who is the one who gets confused. But, as always, Powell's dance is excellent and worth the price of admission. And in this, Lahr plays his cowardly lion, evoking warm memories of that Technicolor film of 1939. An additional benefit is listening to a young Frank, with that wonderful voice and thin vulnerability that he left for his wise character later on. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful time showing his virtuosity. Pay special attention to your unique duet with Dorsey's trumpet man, Ziggy Elman. I say "unique" perhaps because of ignorance, but I do not know any other drum / trumpet sequence like this one in movies or albums. This movie is fun. Even the silly person of Skelton is relatively restricted. Powell shows again that she is the best film dancer in history.
