Strange horror movie full of famous faces but stolen by Cristina Raines (later from "Flamingo Road" on television) as a beautiful but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile that is programmed to pay for her suicide attempts to protect the Portal from hell! The scenes with the Raines modeling are very well captured, the ambient music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina's friend, but when Raines moves to a creepy brown stone of Brooklyn Heights (inhabited by a blind priest on the floor superior), things really start to cook. The neighbors, including a fantastically evil Burgess Meredith and a wicked couple Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo, are a diabolical group, and Eli Wallach is very amused as a cunning police detective. The film is almost a cross pollination of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist", but what a combination! Based on Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, "The Sentinel" is entertainingly spooky, full of surprises that the director Michael Winner, who organizes a pensive downbeat that finishes with skill, has done well. *** 1/2 of ****
