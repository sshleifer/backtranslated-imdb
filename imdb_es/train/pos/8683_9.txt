"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the pivotal opening episodes of "Columbo" that helped define the show for the next thirty years. Mark the first of four appearances by Robert Culp (three as a murderer), playing the same role in each program. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp plays Brimmer, the boss of a large private detectives company that is asked to investigate whether the wife of a rich newspaper mogul, Mr. Kennicut, is having an adventure. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut, in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in exchange for pieces of information about her husband's business partners. She reacts badly to this suggestion, there is an argument that quickly becomes violent when Brimmer hits her in the face. Because she is wearing a large ring, the blow hits her on the ground and kills her. <br /> <br /> There are some really invaluable moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is where Columbo pretends to be interested in reading the palm of his hand, although this is actually a trick to discover the shape and size of Brimmer's ring without admitting that he knows that the killer wore a ring. As Columbo is Columbo, he only reveals what he really knows when it is the exact moment to turn the screws a little. So, initially, he foolishly plays the role of a fairly simple-minded man who gets excited about the "lifeline that goes through the mound of the moon," or some equally ridiculous mumbo jumbo palm-reading. <br /> <br /> Other The big scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for his signature, effectively bribing him to stop touching his nose. Once again, Columbo does not reveal that he knows what is happening, he pretends to feel honored and excited by this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there's another one in which Columbo tells Kennicut, in front of Brimmer, that he wishes the killer could hear their conversation. He wants to insinuate to Brimmer that he is on him, without accusing him directly, for what is quite cruel (but understandable in the circumstances) decides to play games of the mind in Brimmer to scare him and scare him and do something stupid. What of course it does! Meanwhile, the afflicted Kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation. It is only near the end that Columbo explains everything to Kennicut (which is not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I will not reveal how Columbo finally makes the killers fall to the rights, but let's say there is a potato involved. .. <br /> <br /> A really good episode, possibly the best of the first series. If you liked this, you will also like "Double Exposure", also with Robert Culp.
