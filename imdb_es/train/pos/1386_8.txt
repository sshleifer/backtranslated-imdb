Three teenagers in an incomplete triangular relationship. The base of the triangle is just there. At the apex is Marie, a serious, short and thin tomboy with a facial structure similar to Belmondo. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquette, chubby (I dare to say fat) and eager for her first kiss with a child, but not quite ready for their first sexual encounter. Due to their fatness, children do not seem interested and that hurts. <br /> <br /> The other leg of the vertex is a beautiful blonde vampire "fille fatale". She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at a competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public pool. Marie insinuates herself into the life of the vampire by using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. The vampire has the reputation of being a whore, kissing with any young person orbiting her around. Marie is not eliminated by that reputation. Emphasize reputation <br /> <br /> The first half is established. We got to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we got to know the three girls. Eventually, the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and focuses on the high-level relationships between the three. That's when unexpected things begin to happen. <br /> <br /> It is a trademark of French films that drop pearls of wisdom to the viewer. This is not an exception. Here it is about ceilings and death. Watch the movie for more information. <br /> <br /> The director says that the use of synchronized swimming is useful. That sport just for women is a metaphor for a girl's life: beautiful and feminine on the surface, while working hard and competitive below. A series of scenes propel this point: elegant movements and smiles for the audience, ungainly kicks under water. The title in French is also suggestive: "prieuve", or octopus, suggests that an individual has to juggle with many pressures simultaneously.
