What about the rock and roll stars washed in the late 1990s? They launch a return / reunion tour. At least, that's what the members of Strange Fruit, a stadium rock group (fictional) of the 70s, do. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) has the condom vending machine concession when he run into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival. It was at that festival in the 70s that Strange Fruit split. The 70s are "retro" and the time is right to extend that wave. He left in search of the other members of the band. <br /> <br /> Part of what broke the band was the death and replacement of Keith, the lead singer and brilliant songwriter. The band was known for their excessive lifestyle and now they are all back among the working class they came from. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies) is a layman, the bassist is a roofer and his lead singer is still a rocker. Although he owns a huge mansion, he has been forced to sell it, since his fortune has not lasted. Brian, the lead guitarist, is dead, so a young guitarist is hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> A little reluctant, the band agrees to give the meeting a chance. Abandoning their day jobs, they begin rehearsing, and their manager approaches his label to reedit his albums. But he wants them to start touring again. And so they came to the club circuit in Europe. The club scene is not kind to these old overweight and dated rockers. <br /> <br /> It's on the tour that the movie really starts to unfold. All the old conflicts go back, with the figures of Keith and Brian floating everywhere. They all come together because they are looking for a second chance for the greatness that eluded them before. And they rediscover part of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> It starts as Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused movie, following the relationships of the band members. While it's still a very funny movie, it's the evolving characters, who struggle to deal with the death of Brian and Keith and their own personal demons, which makes the movie work.
