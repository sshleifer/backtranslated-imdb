The Gran Caruso shows the unique talents of Mario Lanza. It shows a great capacity for acting and is in full form as a lyric singer, along with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. In fact, I dare say he plays some songs better than Caruso (see A'Vuchella de Tosti and La Danza de Rossini). MGM's art and music departments also did a good job. This movie could be perfect, if it were not for the uncomfortable presence of Ann Blyth; We see that he is doing his best, dressed in the style of the fifties in scenes just before 1920, unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better protagonist, and Blyth should dedicate herself to less demanding productions. Also notice that Mrs. Kirsten sings most of the opera duets with Lanza, giving the wrong idea that Caruso had a kind of permanent main soprano.
