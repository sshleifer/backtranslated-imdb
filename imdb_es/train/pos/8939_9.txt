A powerful adaptation of the successful book and the successful Broadway play about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two sisters of "color" who lived more than 100 years. Marvelously played in his old age by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, respectively, they tell their story in flashbacks to Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white New York Times reporter. The flashback and the current scenes do not have as much inspiring value as in the book, but they are really powerful. However, certain aspects of the sisters' lives, such as the interracial origin of their mother and the reasons behind the severe personality of their father, do not appear clearly. You need to read the book to fully understand these things. Which is just as good, because the book is just as great! Apart from those flaws, it's wonderfully done and done, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational movie.
