This movie is one of the many "Kung Fu" action movies made in Asia in the late 70s - early 80s, full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialogue and incredibly fast martial arts action. But unlike most movies of this genre, it also has a decent plot and a lot of fantastic comedy. When workers in a dye factory are forced to leave their jobs at the hands of the Manchu thugs, they hire a scammer (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them. When his attempt fails miserably, he makes his way into a Shaolin temple to learn how to truly fight. But instead of turning him into a student of Kung-Fu, the Master orders him to build a scaffold to cover the roofs of the 36 chambers. Well, it turns out that while performing these minor tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles), you are learning the skills to be an expert in Kung-Fu! It is something like in Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate making him perform routine housework: "Wax, wax," and so on. There is a lot of good comedy from beginning to end, and a lot of action at the end when Gordon Liu faces once again his Manchu tormentors. "This time it's not just tricks, it's real!" Liu declares, proudly banging his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you will not want to miss this one!
