The "Return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what he did wrong rather than for what he did well, and that's a shame, because the latest chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. He manages to summarize all the story lines of the previous films in a grand finale, and he does it very convincingly. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks, cute and stuffed bears that possibly served to expand the demographics of Star Wars. - And in the middle the film tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is possibly the best piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally finds himself face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in film history. <br /> <br /> The Return of the Jedi did so many things well that people tend to overlook it: it presented an incredible conclusion to the plot of Darth Vader (which went from being somewhat implausible in the "Empire Strikes Back" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful interpretation of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally entering into his account, the resolution of the romance of Solo and Leia, and the extremely powerful final moments on the moon of Endor. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are small annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who have had time to analyze each scene. It is still a magical and moving cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a "good" movie, it's fantastic!
