As a general rule, a full Moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a movie. But since I've enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other movies, I tried. <br /> <br /> Not bad. It's not great, but that's another thing. The film involves a struggle with a mystic "brother" (evil) who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> The possible spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions", and he does so to find a companion who keeps a fortress; However, the guard has been blinded. His eyes are ruined pits. So the magician runs his hands through the eyes of the other, and hey, presto! His eyes have been restored! This type of healing apparently only works with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his "brother" animate a pair of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess which one wins. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that, the image is not bad, although it looks a lot like a comic book. The most "human" adventures of Dr. Mordred are fine, and Combs plays the role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I've seen much worse.
