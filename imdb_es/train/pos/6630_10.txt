This is an important movie. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There is a lot to like here. The director seems interested in disarming some of the most tired film conventions. Unlike much of recent American cinema, this film is interested in what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD includes a lot of additional features, and there are two comments that explain the movie to viewers who are still stunned after an initial viewing. When the film was screened at Sundance, it made more than a few members of the audience uncomfortable and angry. This is a coffee movie on Sunday morning, not a Friday night party movie. For the dedicated viewer, it's a treasure.
