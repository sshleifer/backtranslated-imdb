Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you'll ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I can tell you that Delirious is the funniest movie in history! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and during that time, there was hardly a moment when I was not laughing. You will laugh for hours after it ends, repeating the striking lines over and over in your head. Eddie Murphy has given many fun performances throughout his career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.), but this is by far his moment MORE HILARRADO I have seen this movie so many times, and it is becoming more fun. He never loses his advantage. From this day forward, all the great stand-up performances will be emulated by Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
