As a popular sport, surfing was appreciated by many people. Right after watching the documentary, I realized how dangerous it could be. In fact, surfers are also afraid of big waves. Even someone was killed for it. But they were still surfing and having fun. Only brave people can do it. <br /> <br /> According to what the surfers said, we can clearly know what they felt when the big wave hit them. You have to adapt to your best level and avoid the direct hit of the big wave. When you win, that will obviously bring you great satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The incredible cinematography can not be overlooked. That is absolutely visual enjoyment. <br /> <br /> An excellent sports documentary. 8/10
