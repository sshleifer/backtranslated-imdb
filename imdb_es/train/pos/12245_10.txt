This is the best Emma that exists in my opinion. Having seen the other version (1996) which is also good, and I read the book, I think I can safely say that this is the true interpretation and that it is the most faithful to Jane Austen's masterpiece. The 1996 film with G. Paltrow is also good, it's just that it's almost like a completely different story. It's very clear and fluffy, you do not see the darker edges of the characters and, if you just want a nice movie, one would do well, but the complexity of some of the plot points, like the Churchill / Fairfax tangle, It is so very overlooked as to be virtually non-existent. But if you want the characters to perform a bit, more real and multidimensional, the TV version of 1996 is the superior one. Emma is a remarkable person, but she has faults. Kate Beckinsale is masterful in showing the small quirks of the character. You see her casually disgusted by Harriet Smith's simpler conversation, but she shows no remorse for ruining Harriet's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own conjugal happiness in the end. You see his narcissism and it reflects that of Frank Churchill that they would harm others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to pass the time after having suffered the loss of her governess to the marriage. For Frank Churchill, it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret. In the book, she realizes all this in a crushing awakening to all the mistakes she has made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse, but Paltrow's is more childish and stagnant, while Beckinsale's awakening is quite real and serious and you see the transition from selfish and childish behavior to a kind adult and reflexive. Both versions are very good but I prefer this one.
