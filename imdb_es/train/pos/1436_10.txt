Having worked in downtown Manhattan, and often ate my lunch during the summer days in the park near the City Hall, I saw the mayor come and go. It was great to be able to go beyond the doors of the City Hall and see how it looked in the lobby and throughout the building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", '03, had an excellent performance on the whole scene, and especially when he gave a speech in an African-American church about a young child who was killed. John Cusack, (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury", '03, was a devoted servant of the mayor and worshiped him in everything he tried to achieve. Bridget Fonda, (Marybeth Cogan), begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives him a great supporting role. Last, but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", '01, played a mafia boss who had to make some very difficult decisions towards the end of the image. Great movie with great acting and fantastic photography in New York!
