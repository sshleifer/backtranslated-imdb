['Now I really liked this movie, it was very funny. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, I think that after watching this movie they should do many more films together in the future. <br /><br /> Akshay Kumar gets in trouble when going out with 3 women at the same time, but the way he handled himself when one goes out the door and then the other was so fun to watch, he acted very well in his movie. and I hope he does a great comedy like this in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, plays his role really well and is so understated. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s noticed something of his incredible work, but he&#39;s a very good actor. I love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well. <br /><br /> The muse is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.']
