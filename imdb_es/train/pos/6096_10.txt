I know that, technically, this is not the best television program of all time, I mean it was recorded on video and its limitations are shown in both the audio and the visual aspects. The acting can be a little sloppy. But I love this. Show both. I got really scared when it first aired in 1988. Of course, I would be 5 years old. But recently I bought the DVD of the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I now listen to, it is now deleted. And I also heard that Warner will no longer release due to the poor sales of the first DVD. Also, the TV show did not have the same feeling as the movies, in fact, I thought it had a more sinister tone. Even though the color palette is similar to the nightmare on elm street 4 (both the film and the TV show were made the same year), this has a more serious tone, while the fims were becoming more and more sardonic and jokey. It's not a bad thing, I like Freddy as the clown wise cracker. But I think that was the strength of this TV show, you did not have Freddy showing up every minute. Use a joke before and after he kills someone. In fact, this has more than one dream, reinforced by the soft focus of the lens. I'm not sure if it's deliberate on the part of the creators of the shows or just because of the limitations. to be filmed in video. I love this program, and not as a piece of accompaniment to the cinema can be very nice. Much better than anything on today's television.
