The film begins something like less hyperkinetic, more pastiche Dead or Alive: strange clandestine activities are performed while the police discover bodies. But when a police officer dies, a Tatsuhito gets involved ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get bloody pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> A previous work by Miike, Shinjuku Triad Society is still full of his usual acts of ultraviolence and sex sadists, although it is not one of his most eclectic or extravagant pieces. Rather, it's a bit of pulp fiction, since Tatsuhito makes his way through the underground, a maze that leads him to a gay Triad leader who sells organs from Taiwan bodies illegally obtained and maintains an almost brothel of young boys (one in particular the character that kills the policeman at the beginning). Tatsuhito's brother is getting involved with that society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use sadistic and violent tactics to penetrate this sordid realm. <br /> <br /> What is mainly interesting in this bit of work It is the relationship that Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, who then returned to Japan and alienated himself for it. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, so he killed his father and developed a criminal wing in Japan. Wang is also a surprisingly Shakespearian character, who is strange enough as he is, let alone really start feeling sorry for him the moment his last confrontation with Tatsuhito occurs. And Tatsuhito himself is an equally tragic figure when he is forced to deal with his lack of ability to control his brother. While it would be impolite to claim that Miike's films are successful mainly in their shock value, it is true that sometimes it is easy to lose sight of how well Miike can create bitter and dispassionate characters. <br /> <br /> -PolarisDiB
