After I became completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think there was another program that came close to being as good as this one. Well, I was wrong! Lost is fascinating !! I love this show and I can not turn it off. The richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful surroundings are incredible. I am totally and completely hooked. I do not know how the creators do it, but each character touches me very deeply. I feel your joy, your pain, everything, to the bottom! I do not have a cable, so I've been renting the series on Netflix. When I put it on, I see all the episodes at once and I feel sad when it ends. I can not wait for the next album to arrive at my house. This is probably the best TV show I've seen!
