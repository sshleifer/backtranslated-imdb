Oh, it's great to see a Silent Classic from time to time! The director Vidor is simply charming and even makes a long cameo (at least for 1928) as himself. The story is about succeeding in life and the way it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a larger "drama" studio. She becomes a big star and the consequences are that she really moves away from the real world. For a moment she even denies her (poor) past! The cameos are simply hilarious, certainly the scene where the protagonist (Marion Davies) sees Marion Davies in the studios and concludes that it does not seem so special ... It has to be one of the first films. The movies here and for the real phenomena is amazing to see the cameras and the material of then. A must if you ask me !!
