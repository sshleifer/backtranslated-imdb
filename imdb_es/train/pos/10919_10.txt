Five Deadly Venoms is not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but it presents some of the best hand-to-hand fighting sequences in the history of Hong Kong cinema. Director Chang Cheh creates what many consider his masterpiece. This movie launched the races of the five men who play the poisons. Meng He plays another bad ass. He would continue to be in Super Ninjas. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwok, would go to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Any fan of socky chop can appreciate this. But I still think he's not as good as Super Ninjas (also made by Chang Cheh). But all the chop socky are good and this is one of the best.
