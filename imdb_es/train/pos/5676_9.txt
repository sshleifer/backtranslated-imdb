SERIES THREE: BLACKADDER THE THIRD "If you want something to be done correctly, kill Baldrick before starting" On the heels of the second series, the program returned with the current owner of the famous name without luck and in service as Prince Regent's butler , a useless and stupid foil for the poison of Blackadders, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in the trailer as the other piece of the comic puzzle. The format is similar to the previous program, after all, they had found the winning formula why change things. We see Blackadder trying to enrich himself in the back of the credulous regent in many more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladrick an M.P.o of trying a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways, this is one of the most accurate of the series, historically, the Prince Regent took control of the throne during the battle of his parents' madness and some of the informed characters talk a lot about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington go through the events and they manage to steal their scenes, which is not easy with such a stellar cast.
