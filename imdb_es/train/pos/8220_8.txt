The fourth of the series "Dirty Harry", this film presents one of the most despicable, most unpleasant, unpleasant, profane and disgusting females I've seen in the film: "Ray Perkins", played by Audrie Neenan. She is the modern and unpleasant low life version of the character of "Deviance" of 1945, "Ann Savage". <br /> <br /> His attitude of dirty mouth and gutter turned me off so much that I never saw this film again until I acquired it. a filter of profanity that silenced her ... and at least some of it! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Everywhere "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) disappears, the violence immediately follows ... in a matter of minutes! It happens so often that it's almost ridiculous, but it becomes an entertaining and fast-moving movie with a satisfying ending, since all the villains are eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a very sophisticated movie that appeals to our basic instincts ... and connects, I'm sorry to say. Most of us like to see these garbage balls get it in the end, and who does it better than Harry the Dirty?
