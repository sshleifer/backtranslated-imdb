['Thirty years after its initial release, the third version of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; finally comes to the DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand. That would include me since I saw her in a concert singing among other numbers, the feminist anthem &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot; of this 1976 film. Easy to discard, the story that polarizes the film&#39;s career is such a robust stack of cliches Hollywood-style variations exist in other films that include the &quot;Funny Girl&quot; by Streisand. This time, readjusted to the then contemporary music scene, the time-worn plot follows the self-destructive rock star John Norman Howard in his deep immersion career, just as he meets the club&#39;s singer Esther Hoffman, who is waiting for her great opportunity. <br /><br /> The problems pursue their courtship from the beginning, since John Norman (both names, please) responds to fans and unbelieving DJs with acts of random violence (of which inexplicably escapes the persecution). For John Norman, Esther represents her last chance to be happy and, in turn, she is attracted to the innate and creative musician under the facade. In the most important scene of the film, it gives Esther her great opportunity in a charity concert and her career takes off. Inevitably, he can not handle the failure of his career in light of his meteoric success, and if he is familiar with any version of this story, he knows the rest. Directed by Frank Pierson (although obviously the talents of the incipient director of Streisand are on display), the film still manages to attract my attention, although I know that it has a brazen and manipulative design. It still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws. <br /><br /> Although Streisand at its best seems to be the ideal choice to play a rising star singer, her character on the screen is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credibly. The same can be said of his style of interpretation, since the script seems to allow his softer material oriented to the Contemporaries for Adults to be accepted within the hardened world of the sand of the arena. From the moment he raises his head as the center of the Oreos, he can not help but find himself as an established star. I can forgive the lapse simply because she&#39;s an unparalleled vocal talent, but what becomes less lenient is how she makes Esther more strident than heartwarming when John Norman&#39;s problems become overwhelming. This creates a strangely disconcerting dynamic in the last part of the movie when it becomes less about the cause of the climatic event than Esther&#39;s response. This is topped by an uninterrupted eight-minute close-up of his commemorative performance, great, except when he regrettably imitates John Norman&#39;s style towards the end. <br /><br /> Kristofferson, on the other hand, offers an excellent performance at all times, achieving a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his feelings of love, pride and resentment towards Esther. He does his grunt work on the stage soaked with vodka in this context. Otherwise, what always seems strange about this version is how all the secondary characters are relegated to the background as if they did not exist, unless they were interacting with the two main characters. The only ones who register are Paul Mazursky as John Norman&#39;s boss, Brian and Gary Busey, as his cynical band manager, Bobbie. The cameraman veteran Robert Surtees provides a good brightness to the cinematography, although a level of grain in the impression persists. A great seller in his day, the soundtrack is a mix of different styles from the 1970s - some still quite good songs (&quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;, &quot;Watch Closely Now&quot;), some of which have been passed to kitsch (&quot;Queen Bee&quot;, &quot;I Believe in Love&quot; by Kenny Loggins and, of course, the inescapable &quot;Evergreen&quot;. <br /><br /> The print transfer on the 2006 DVD is clean and the sound is clear thanks to digital remastering. Streisand&#39;s participation is the main attraction of the extras that begin with his feature-length commentary. She gives insightful information about the genesis of the film, casting and production, reportedly with problems. She is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of Jon Peters, her hairdresser boyfriend who became the producer of the film, and his dissatisfaction with Pierson as director. I just wish she could have provided more specific comments on the scene that relate directly to what&#39;s on the screen. He also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood hits him, for example, he becomes tired of hearing for the third time that the person who interprets the driver was a friend of Peters. I think having a second commentator could have extracted other nuggets of it. <br /><br /> There is a costume reel that shows some fun clothes from the 70s, especially the Kristofferson mixed-knit poncho and the orange polyester shirt. There are also twelve deleted scenes included with the optional Streisand comment. One of them is a comic scene for baking bread that reminded me how much I like Streisand in absurd comedies. Another is an extended scene in which he plays &quot;Evergreen&quot; on the guitar in front of an astonished Kristofferson who then falls asleep. The most interesting is an alternative version of the musical ending that incorporates quick cuts, which I agree with that Streisand should have been used. Appropriately, the theatrical trailers for the three versions of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; are also included.']
