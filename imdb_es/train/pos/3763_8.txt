Now is better! The first film had a bit of dubious dialogue and a weaker performance, but it seems that the team behind this gathered their ideas for the sequel and released a solid comedy, completely fun, hilarious and creative that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats . all the way. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is full of great things, overflowing with creativity, and it's less of a parody in the 80s movies at the same time. The scenes in hell are great, and so are those in heaven. There really is no shortage in the crazy adventure game that promises, and you will never see another movie like this. Even the final act of the film is not as bad as the first, being generally comforting and enjoyable in its extremely cliched repertory of family fun. And even Keanu Reeves, despite being about 30 years old, is not that bad here. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a good deal to me.
