"The libretto, by the composer as usual, is an imbroglio of religion, paganism, eroticism and possibly even homoeroticism, and its extension can make it seem to the audience that dry paint can be heard. <br /> <br /> Wagner, being a famous anti-Semite, (Klingsor may be one of his substitute Jewish villains) naturally entrusted the premiere to an unconverted (not for lack of RW!) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite conductor (Imagine!) Kundry, one of the most mixed and another likely Jewish substitute, is villainous or benevolent, depending on the scene. <br /> <br /> Given that many video versions of Parsifal seem to have no On the other hand, this opera film is, in comparison, a breath of fresh air, Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, the director, has given it a considerable imagination, but it is difficult to know why he made some of his decisions. : the notorious dual Parsifals (of each gender), the puppets, the game of Wagner's death mask and several dolls and symbols like the Nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes. (If I remember, the "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote the real music to eliminate the changes in the scene.) Although Wagner himself died too soon to be a true Nazi, many of his descendants (as well as his second wife, Cosima). they were at least traveling companions, including his grandson Wolfgang Wagner, who still runs the Bayreuth Festival at an advanced age. In fact, Wolfgang's son, Gottfried Wagner, in total opposition to his father, has tried to reach an honest agreement with his great-grandfather. <br /> <br /> Syberberg also seems politically ambiguous from what I've read. In 1977, he made a well-known film about Hitler, "Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland" (sometimes called "Our Hitler" in English). Since it lasts 8 hours and has not been widely distributed, most people have not seen it (including myself). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the director of the audio CD on which this film is based. , plays Amfortas (played by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick play the dual Parsifals (both sung by Reiner Goldberg.) and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor . <br /> <br /> Although the opera takes place over a long period of time and it has been described that everyone (except Kundry?) has aged considerably between Acts 2 and 3, no one looks an older day at the end of the opera. (The magic of the Grail? In this opera, the Grail is the cup of which Jesus drank at the Last Supper and not to Mary Magdalene as in more recent times, an idea that seems absurd to me!). <br /> <br /> The driving and singing are quite useful and the DVD seems to have improved the sound, if not the image, to a large extent. (Yes, I agree that the "Kna" approach is superior, even in the second stereo version, but it is probably superior to all the recorded versions in general). <br /> <br /> It's not a Parsifal for all the Wagnerites, but I think it works pretty well like a filmed opera.
