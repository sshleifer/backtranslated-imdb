The Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the circuit of the art house for assault with the intriguing and surprisingly intelligent Cube, which is my personal favorite movie of the 90s in SF. He framed the basic concept of a group of strangers trapped in a labyrinth shaped like a giant cube, filmed in its entirety in a set, and took this idea in fascinating directions. <br /> <br /> I've been anxiously waiting for Natali to follow up, and even though it took her five years to put together a project, I'm happy to say it was worth the wait. Cypher is a fascinating exploration of a man's place in the world, and how through a completely logical chain of events, he finds himself in a situation beyond his control. <br /> <br /> I do not want to reveal too much about the plot, because one of the joys of Cypher are the different ways that it drags us. It's so refreshing in this time to see an SF movie that has more than one idea in its head. Cypher is a movie of this kind. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the dumbest people who have ever walked the planet, is hired by the DigiCorp company. They send it to different parts of America to record different seminars. To their bewilderment, they are incredibly boring. Covering such mundane topics as shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan is waiting for a seminar, he meets Rita Foster (an impeccable Lucy Liu), the definition of an ice maiden. She gives him the brushing, but there is something in her that he finds irresistible. It is not too surprising considering the dry marriage it is in. <br /> <br /> When Rita appears in another of Morgan's seminars, she tells him that her life is not what it seems. And I'm not saying anything else about the plot. Doing that would cheapen the impact that the rest of the film has on us, as well as the tortuous path that is very fun to follow. <br /> <br /> As with Cube, Natali shows great talent to embrace the seemingly common. people, taking them out of the familiar and, basically, seeing what will happen when they are pushed into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar patterns. But it's not a carbon copy of Cube. It has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a movie that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoid stories. One of the great things about Cypher is the way in which these themes are introduced into the story without his knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle, it is as shocking to us as it is to him. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished he is. is. Where Cube was limited to a minimalist environment and a limited budget with a cast of unknowns, Cypher also has a low budget, but Natali saves it all he can, which allows him to expand the horizon and launch Morgan on an amazing journey to through the labyrinth of their own identity. <br /> <br /> Natali's management is exceptional, with a skillful hand in the reins. There are some incredible camera angles from above, like the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a vast and robust office block in conjunction with the insignificant speck that is Morgan outside. All the color seems to have been erased from the image, which complements the tone of the film perfectly like a modern black cinema. <br /> <br /> The performance is uniformly excellent at all times. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure of his loveless marriage to question his own identity. His performance is excellent because it is very modulated. Literally it seems to transform before our very eyes. From a clinical punisher, without thorns, to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett makes a welcome appearance that made such an impact on Cube. He resides in a secret silo that looks like it was taken from Men in Black. His scene is one of the best because it is an exercise in suspense and paranoia carefully calculated. He is a supposed expert in the identification of double agents, and it is a fantastic piece of writing, brilliantly interpreted by Hewlett. All you have to do is look at Morgan, and we're trapped in your complex mental game. <br /> <br /> But it's Lucy Liu who is the scene thief here. Too often, she is chosen in movies where her potential is not maximized. But in Cypher, he is finally given a character that fits like a glove. Rita is a fatal and reserved woman that Liu inhabits with pleasure. I was encouraged every time he appeared because he is always in control and can reduce the room to silence with the power of his frozen gaze alone. <br /> <br /> Things come to a very rewarding end, that does not end with an ambiguous note like Cube did. But Morgan deserves his happy ending. After they put it on the bell like that, I encouraged it in the final scene. It is a perfect final moment because it appears as a ray of sunshine after 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Cypher is successful in all aspects. Attractive, shocking, always entertaining, is everything that Total Recall wanted to be but was not. And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix. <br /> <br /> A good follow-up of Natali. And now I am an enthusiastic fan of man. Great things!
