One of the best movies I've seen was an Irish film entitled Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the play before watching the movie and I loved both. It is the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to the United States because he can not make a living in Ireland. It is told both from the perspective of the young man (whom the other characters in the movie can see) and another young man who represents his thoughts and feelings without censorship, but who can not be seen by the other characters in the film. It's a very sad movie, but very moving, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about. I love any Irish movie, or almost any movie about Ireland, and any movie that has the late Irish actor Donal McCann gets my vote. I would see that man chewing gum for 2 hours on the screen, and unfortunately, I have it. Terrible Too bad to have lost him so young.
