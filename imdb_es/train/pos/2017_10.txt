After reading just two of the comments in this document, as a lifelong Bronte fan, starting with Olivier's Heathcliff and lingering with the many versions of Charlotte's "Rochester," it's more than revealing to see that it's Sister Ansung Bronte who gave the lie to the chauvinist-chauvinist era that inhabited the trio. Of course, the "miracle" in the three versions of nineteenth-century British domesticity is that the "girls" were all "spinsters" and their only realistic brushstrokes with "men" were their vicar father and his villain. brother. That said, finally, it is ANNE Bronte who, in her unique essay, proved to be the "feminist" point, well ahead of contemporary types and including the ranks of "voting franchise". However, the story evidences more than a few that preceded, among them the Greek Heterai and Sappho and the tastes of the ancient emperor Yang Kuei-fei. And how about "Eva" and her apple?
