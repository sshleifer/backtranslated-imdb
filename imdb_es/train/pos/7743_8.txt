['I went to see her twice this movie, a friend of mine went to see her at the premiere party, and he told me it was so cool, that I expected a lot about the movie, that I could not enjoy it because I was not seeing it in a nuteral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time I felt like having a party.

If you can deliver this movie like the first one, you must have talent. <br /><br /> The performance is performed by some great Belgian stars (Dirk Roofthooft) and a group of emerging talents such as Titus De Voogdt. <br /><br />']
