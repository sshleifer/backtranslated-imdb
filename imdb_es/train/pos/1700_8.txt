I really liked that movie. You have to respect the dwarves who disguised themselves as little Martians. Of course, the story may have been thin at times, but you can not remove the way it was done. I used to see this again and again when I was 8 years old. It is a movie for children, and also has some of the best quotes in history. The interpretation of "Home on the Range" by Blanzee is impressive. <br /> <br /> very well done if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
