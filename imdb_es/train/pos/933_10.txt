['I saw this movie in the sixth grade at Christmas time, and I was very excited to see it, and when I heard that George C. Scott was in it, I was really excited, because I really love George C. Scott! When I and my class were watching this movie, I really liked it, and when it was over, it impressed me a lot, I thought it was totally fabulous! This is the best version of the classic novel by Charles Dickens that I have seen so far! The performance of George C. Scott as Scrooge is something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he is the ultimate Scrooge! I&#39;ve seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other is Patrick Stewart&#39;s, but this is the best one! <br /><br /> The really great thing about this is the acting, I thought the actors were fabulous, they all were, the spirits, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone, they could not have found anyone better than those who had done the parts! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw it, I thought it was the best of all! He is the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think they could find someone better! I do not think they could have found someone better to replace anyone in the movie! <br /><br /> This film is probably the final adaptation to the film of the Charles Dickens classic, and I really think you will agree, you will think that this movie is fabulous! I&#39;m probably going to have to buy this movie on DVD, because I thought it was totally fabulous! I totally recommend that you see this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, period. <br /><br /> 10/10']
