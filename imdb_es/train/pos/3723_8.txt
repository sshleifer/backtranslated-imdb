There is an inexhaustible hunger for "basic training" films, so it is surprising that it has received so little attention when it premieres for the first time. It seems likely that he has a second well-deserved life on DVD / VHS. <br /> <br /> Tigerland is not in any way great, there are some terribly clich√©d characters (especially the portrait of non-commissioned officers, it makes you long for the return of Lee 'Full Metal Jacket' Ermey), but the main performance of Colin Farrell is a product of instant stardom. Charisma to burn and a role that any actor would kill to get.
