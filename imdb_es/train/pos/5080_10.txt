When ever a film is produced or directed by Mel Ferrer, you can bet your life that any of his paintings will be seen from generation to generation. The only fact that Claudette Colbert, (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", '47 that appears and stars in the film, will turn it into a great classic film. In this film, Ellen Ewing marries and then encounters all kinds of mental problems and even murders. The mystery gets very involved and Robert Ryan, (David McLean), "Battle of the Bulge", '65, comes to Ellen's aid and, sometimes, you even wonder if David is on the rise. As you see this image, you are almost beginning to understand who the really crazy person is and, suddenly, you start to change your mind about how the movie will end. The great performance of Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, who played a completely different role from what he usually plays on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to a great movie star, Audrey Hepburn. Great classic movie, with great classic actors!
