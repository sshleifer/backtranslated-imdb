Sometimes I get tired of reading reviews of some of Hitchcock's lesser-known films, because almost all of them start with someone who says that this movie is overlooked or that it's a hidden gem of Hitchcock or a real great Hitchcock or some another generic, only if people - would see - this - they - would see - that - this - is - great - Hitchcock - movie - alone - so much - a lot - like - Vertigo - North - through - Northwest - Psycho - Back - Window - So that, that said, I would like to say that if - only - people - would look - this - they - would - see - this - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock movie - just - like - a lot - like - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psico - Rear window - etc. <br /> <br /> Now, that may be exceeding a little, the Ring is not even by imagination. in the same league as any of the films mentioned twice above, but compared to the other films that Hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, I really think that The Ring is one of the best films photographed in interpreted of almost all. As an almost new director, there are some amazing dream sequences and brilliant editing segments that show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie starts, among other things. things, the extremely disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus artist (and I use idiot the definitive way, the way Stephen King does it often) when he is thrown eggs and fruit a crowd that is not the most elegant white people . I guess this just illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then, but I think it's one of the most unpleasant sequences in any Hitchcock movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> The main attraction in The Circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock down any man in a round, but when he meets his partner, it is against a man who challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger. . Thus begins an entertaining but not very tense challenge to the love of a woman, who seems to swing from one man to another effortlessly and without thinking. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) There is, for example, a scene where her husband watches her from above while they leave her at home late at night and, just before entering the building, they force her to return to the car to kiss. This kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that, even in the end, when she proves to be faithful to her husband, or at least finally chooses, they look each other in the eye but do not kiss. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly beautifully photographed, even more so than several films that Hitch launched in later years. There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as coach of One Round Jack who, in his stone-faced expressionism, often reminds me of the brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch leaves it a little ambiguous, but this is a great sample of his first works.
