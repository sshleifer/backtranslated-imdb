I have had the opportunity to watch several movies on BluRay and HD DVD. This film is maintained in its wonderful action and great story. Although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent image, this is not it. Not having this movie on DVD helped facilitate the purchase. I've always liked intense action and excellent acting that do not always go together. In general, that's what makes this an excellent fun movie to watch. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you have two things. An image that is almost crystal clear without distortion or a film with high definition grainy image. I was disappointed when I made this my first blu ray movie. I almost started thinking that this was a blu ray standard. Although after watching other movies I know better. I do not think it would be as long as they should have transferred this movie to HD. That is usually the problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and Blue Ray discs, you should only have the best image. So I just think that this is a worthwhile investment for people who have never seen the movie or who have not purchased the DVD version.
