Directed by the duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto, "Meatball Machine" is apparently a remake of the 1999 Yamamoto movie with the same name. I doubt that I will ever have the opportunity to see the original, so I'm just going to continue commenting on this one. First of what is "Meatball Machine"? A simple nowadays, pretentious budget of low budget industrial splashes full of excellent make-up and gore effects. It's not something you end up writing books about, but it's entertaining if you like this kind of cinema. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" follows the familiar plot. The boy loves the girl but is very afraid to ask him for a date. The boy finally meets the girl. The girl is infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. Boy, in turn, also transforms himself into that thing, and goes on a quest to save his love. He will be successful? Who cares, as long as there is killing and death I am satisfied. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, relatively clich√©, but it does its job well enough to set the course of the film in a bloody confrontation between the two main characters. There is a secondary argument that focuses on how the parasite that infected the girl entered their lives. And yes, fortunately it also shows more violence. I am happy. Acting is what you would expect from a movie without budget splash. It's not exactly painful to the ears, but it's not exactly good either. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film, besides the violence and the gore (as I have not mentioned it enough) are the cyborg designs. Made by Keita Amemiya, who works on the creation of extravagant creatures and costumes for movies and video games, it is well known. The necroborgs as they are called in "Meatball Machine" look amazingly detailed. Without the use of CGI, Amemiya's designs are an impressive fusion of flesh and metal, with a painful appearance. Able to transform various parts of the body into fresh weapons such as saws, rocket launchers, shotguns that fire blood and so on. Although you can easily recognize the low cost of the film, the necroborgs are a kind of film A. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with "Alien", all done in low Budget and extra ketchup mode. It is an immensely entertaining film that ignores modern special effects and shows that the genre of the splash is still alive and kicking.
