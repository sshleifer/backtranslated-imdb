Although it was a very nice musical, what impressed me about this movie was the unexpected chemistry of the comedy between Basil Rathbone, as a composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. In playing a distracted and distant artistic type (far removed from their more familiar roles, either as threatening villains or as the coldly logical Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's character seems like he could not get out of bed without help. And that help is Starbuck, played with his usual comic humor by Oscar Levant. By hiring the character of Crosby as his ghostwriter, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck by saying, "He does everything I think for me," to which Levant responds: "Ah, it's just a part-time job." Of course, this goes further (or more) than Rathbone, who is too busy worrying about where his next song will come from. As another critic said, who knew that Rathbone could be so fun! Too bad he did not have more opportunities to show his comedic talent.
