Clear and well done documentary focused on Mardi Gras accounts. I have always liked this approach to making films: communicate ideas about a bigger, more complex and often inscrutable phenomenon by dividing the problem into something familiar and close to my home. <br /> <br /> I am sure that most people heard stories about workshops and understood the basic motives behind profits and capitalism, and the effect of globalism on poorer nations (however, people he feels it). Instead of exposing on these issues and getting up in a soap box (there's nothing wrong with that, apart from the documentaries that usually preach to converts), this documentary simply shows the Mardi Gras accounts, how they are made, by what people and under what conditions, and then how are they used by consumers at the end of the process. Investigate in an open and clear manner the motivations of all those involved in the process, including workers, factory management, US importers and, finally, the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I felt a little sick about this; also by the revelers of Mardi Gras, but also by the way in which workers in China have accepted their situation as normal and even for the course (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). The images of the street sweepers who cleaned the streets accounts at the end, made a particular impression. But that was just my reaction; I can see how someone else can read this documentary a little differently. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries on this subject, I do not think you have to have a specific political opinion to be affected by this. This is, ultimately, a story about human beings and our relationship to the goods we produce and consume. If you have ever bought a product made in the Far East, this should give you something to think about. <br /> <br /> Outstanding and highly recommended. I need to see more documentaries like this one. Congratulations to all those involved in the making of this film.
