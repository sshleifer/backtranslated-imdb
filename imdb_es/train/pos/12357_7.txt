I really liked this movie and I saw it twice more in a week. <br /> <br /> Mrs. The detmers nailed the performance: it was like a hungry cat that prowled, playing with its prey. She lashes out with anger and lust, takes a "too young" lover and hits hundreds of fine porcelain pieces of the mother of her fianc√© terrorist. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of beautiful touches. The Maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the roofs. I especially enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation of 'Antigone'. <br /> <br /> I had a feeling of 'Story of O', that is, where media people indulge in an unrestrained sexual adventure. While walking through the fantastic amateur apartment, she feels comfortable. And why not, what is to repress a "Devil in the flesh"? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real pleasure!
