This movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season. Celebrate a quality best described as simple friendship. Morgan Freeman plays a character very similar to Freeman himself: a successful actor who promotes 70. He has traveled to a small and quite dirty grocery store with the intention of investigating a role he could play, as manager of a place like that. It soon deceives the staff and clients, especially the charming (though irritable) young man (Paz Vega) who presides over the "10 items or less" payment lane. <br /> <br /> 10 items or less does not have a great statement to make and does not claim to do so. Follow Freeman and Vega as they become friendly, and while the older man offers his advice, in exchange for being taken home, Gofer, who is supposed to pick him up, never shows up and Freeman has forgotten his own number of phone. He can not ask for help. I had a little case of blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York City and this movie cured what was bothering me.
