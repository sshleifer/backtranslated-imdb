I do not think this movie is for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and it seemed like a lot of fun. I have not laughed so much during a movie in a long time. I thought the whole cast did a great job. You will find yourself laughing from the first moment until the last scene. I suspect that this kind of humor will turn off some viewers (especially those who take themselves too seriously) by this brand of humor. I do not. The movie was a real surprise. And all the theater was rolling with laughter throughout the presentation I attended, which makes me think that many people had fun and were happy to have a good time at the cinema for a change. I can not wait to see you again! If you're in the mood for LOL, then this is for you. Funny funny funny funny!
