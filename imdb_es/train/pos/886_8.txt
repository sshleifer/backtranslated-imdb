This was one of the DVDs that I recently bought in a set of six called "Frenchfilm" to review our French before our planned holidays in beautiful Provence this year. So far, in addition to improving our French, we have greatly improved our appreciation of French cinema. <br /> <br /> What a breath of fresh air to the stagnant, predictable, unimaginative, crash bang wallop drop that Hollywood is producing! . What a good example for the writers, actors, directors and filmmakers to follow. It was also very stimulating to see two identifiable characters in the main roles without having to be the cover figures of a glossy magazine. <br /> <br /> The other thing that I liked about this movie was the slow development of the plot and the plot, which made you guess how everything was going to end. Is there really something good about this selfish bully who continually treats his seemingly naive benefactor with the kind of contempt that an ex-con would show? Will our poor half-deaf heroine be shown sexually frustrated with the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has given her? The viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feelings with each other. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen this movie, like me, you might want to watch it again. I still have to find out the psychological motive of the director for the secondary plot in the role of parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of the camera work deserve a second look. The plot calls for a little imagination when our hero has the opportunity to help our heroine misused and overworked in the office. You must also have a broad mind to believe in your brilliant lip reading and how part of the action fits into place. But if you follow the exciting journey with this example of French cinema, you will leave more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.
