A lot of people hated this movie, but that's what I attribute to two things: 1: they want it to look a bit like the first couple of American Pie movies. and 2: they are trying to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> This one I found was the best of the six, and I love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I'll say it, but then, what teen comedy IS NOT? Road trip, dirty acts, etc., etc., they are all incredibly predictable, but they are still very funny! I say it's worth seeing, I love it, I find it hilarious. Just do not see it while you compare it with the first ones because it does not look like anything. <br /> <br /> After watching Naked Mile and this, it became clear that all the American Pie movies were about, and only about, The Stiflers. What is FINE for me? <br /> <br /> Watch. Enjoy. Love. XD
