Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels that God is ruining his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could get worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first class and seems to be at home, since God and the cast combine the plot well. The jokes are almost always accurate, although sometimes they resort too much to Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film really portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this pretty good, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some funny scenes, the initial scene of the cookies, for example, others lose a bit of the objective but it is still a good movie. 6/7 out of 10
