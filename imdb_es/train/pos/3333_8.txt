I could see this on the plane to New Zealand last week, and I was wondering how it would live up to the movie and the UK book. I have to say that it has impressed me favorably. In any case, the fanatical attachment to the Red Sox during the years of scarcity works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC, which has been successful over the years. As a Briton, I was also interested to see that it is not necessary to understand baseball to understand what is happening. One question comes to mind: the script written with the Sox as a team even before they finally broke the Curse of the Bambino? Or was another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan (I know weird, a Brit who understands baseball), I must say that it added to the enjoyment.
