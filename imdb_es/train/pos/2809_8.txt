['The saddest thing about this movie is that only 8 people were concerned about leaving a review of it and NO-ONE felt it was worth leaving a comment in the forums. <br /><br /> Made the same year as Philadelphia ... Oscar winner Tom Hanks ... this is the movie that people REALLY should have seen and rewarded. There is more humanity, life, love, tenderness and beauty in these two people than in almost any other gay movie I&#39;ve seen ... and everything is true. <br /><br /> In order to print this, I need to leave some lines of text more: suffice it to say that anyone who REALLY wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60s and 70s, and understand how AIDS was. before the modern &quot;cocktails&quot; of drugs allowed people to breathe a little easier ... this is the movie to watch. <br /><br /> Oh, and I&#39;m going to add a personal comment about AIDS. In spite of everything, there has actually been a positive side to all the horror. When AIDS came for the first time, it was called &quot;gay cancer,&quot; and governments preferred to &quot;let them die&quot; instead of spending a penny on research to help save a bunch of queers. Then it became clear that AIDS would also be a heterosexual disease. But the government was not ready for that; Then, when heterosexual people also began to get sick, the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those that had been created by the homosexuals themselves (examples: The Names Project: the quilt that commemorates all those who died of AIDS; Act Up, etc.) The result is that people who probably would never have been in contact with homosexuals in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them, because there was no other organization. This close contact, in my opinion, is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the direct world to accept gays as equals. When AIDS first appeared on the scene, many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to attack us even more ... and that would probably have been true if the straights did not suddenly become ill; However, the progress that has been made in gay liberation, to the point that, as I write this, there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage, these gains would probably have taken much longer without AIDS to bring us together. It is sad to think that all those people, both heterosexual and homosexual, had to die before our common humanity became more obvious, but if what I write here is true, and I think it is, then there is a little comfort to take in the realization that all those people did not die in vain.']
