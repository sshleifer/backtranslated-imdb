All Dogs Go to Heaven is the most beautiful animated film to have dogs in 1989. Don Bluth's previous film The Land Before Time (1988) became a hit. Dogs are as cute as little mice. Oh, I just want to hug them when they're cute. Where it was? Oh yeah. Its animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they are perfectly expressed and the songs are beautiful and moving. It opened its doors on November 17, 1989. The same date as The Little Mermaid produced by the animation of Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> The part where Charlie was killed by Carface was so unforgivable. Carface is so bad because he wanted to kill Charlie. It's his fault! The song of Love Survive played by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All dogs go to heaven is the best animated film in history.
