I just left and I can not believe how brilliant this documentary is. Rarely do you leave a movie theater with such astonishment and amazement. Lately, movies have become so exaggerated that the excitement of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens. Amores Perros did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing it to me now. I did not know anything about this before entering and what a surprise. If you listen to the concept, you may have the feeling that this is one of those delicate films about an incredible triumph covered with the best music and we try to convince ourselves completely of the great story that counts, but then they will not let us in. Fortunately this is not that movie. People tell the story! This does a good job of capturing every moment of your participation as we enter your world and feel every second with them. There is a lot beyond climbing that makes everything that happens much more tense. Touching the void was also a great doc on climbing mountains and showing intensity in an attractive way, but this film is much more than a human story. I just saw it today, but I'm going to say that this is one of the best documentaries I've seen.
