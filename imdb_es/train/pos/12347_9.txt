This is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village, which could best be described with the constellations of scenes and the direction of Kurosawa's works combined with the themes of Dostoevsky's human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), the drama by Shakespeare and Hans Christian Andersen's Tragic and cheerful. The script is wonderful, the scenes are colorful, and some beautiful scenes are really printed in my mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable: each of the characters is very well developed and interesting. There is also a small action, so if you do not like all the feelings, you would also have to pay the costs. It is not about mysterious Geishas and Samurai proud with their Bushido pouring everything on them, but about life, work and the kind of people that are everywhere at any time. A beautiful and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa, which is worth seeing.
