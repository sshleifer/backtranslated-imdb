This movie has an excellent pace, you never have to wait for a laugh to arise for more than a minute and there is much more at stake than the initial premise of the movie. Throughout it, there are mockeries of the traditional genre of local adversity, boys, good, outdated, of which these parodies. Do not let anyone tell you that you are trying to get cheap laughs just for the use of obscenities; Of course, there is a lot of that, but everything is contextual, not free. I loved this movie and it only cost me Â£ 2.99 on DVD, so, in terms of entertainment, it was the best movie I've seen this year.
