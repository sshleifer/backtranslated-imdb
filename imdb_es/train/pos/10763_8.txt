I must admit that I was very skeptical about this documentary. I expected it to be the kind of American propaganda that we in Europe here dislike so much. I was wrong. This is NOT propaganda, in fact, it is not political at all. <br /> <br /> Represents the events of 9/11 through the eyes of firefighters called to the scene right after the planes crashed. It is an incredible coincidence that this documentary has been filmed! This film was initially filmed as a documentary about a rookie firefighter from New York who became "a man". We can only thank the filmmakers who continued their work during the terrible experience that confronted them. <br /> <br /> A great job. Absolutely awesome stuff. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> Regards,
