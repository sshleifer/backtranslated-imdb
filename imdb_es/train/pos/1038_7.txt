I loved the movie. I even liked most of the actors in it. But, for me, Mrs. Davis's very bad attempt at an accent, and her rigid interpretation really make a film otherwise very hard to see. Seriously, if some other modern actor played the same role in the same style as Mrs. Davis, they would laugh at the screen. <br /> <br /> I really believe that she 'called this in'. Now, if Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman had played the role of the wife, I would have enjoyed it much more. <br /> <br /> I guess I just do not 'understand' Bette Davis. I have always thought of her as an actress who "plays herself" no matter what role she is in. The possible exception is Now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain it carefully. (and I hope civil) detail how I am totally wrong in this. But I will continue to see the movies that he is in, because I like stories / writings / supporting roles, but I will always be thinking of different actresses who could have done a better job.
