['&quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; was never a great movie to start, but it&#39;s a classic. You know it&#39;s a classic at the moment when their insistent song, &quot;Everybody&#39;s Talking&quot; starts on the soundtrack, (actually it&#39;s not written for the movie), and the way the camera introduces us to Joe Buck (naked and in the shower). We had seen Jon Voight before, but we had never noticed him, but when he tells us he is &#39;an infernal stallion&#39;, who can doubt him? This was a great performance that had an iconic star status, as well as a full understanding of the character and if Voight had never done anything else, his performance here would still be legendary. As is Voight he has rarely disappointed on the screen; even a piece of ham as cured as his performance in that glorious garbage &quot;Anaconda&quot; is a source of pleasure). <br /><br /> The film became famous and infamous almost overnight. It was a pleasure for the crowd (even with its crazy ending), fun and sexy and recognizably &quot;real&quot;; (It was the end of the sixties and all the characters sounded real). It was also the first &#39;X&#39; rated film to win the Oscar for Best Film of the Year. Adapted, (brilliantly), by Waldo Salt, from a novel by James Leo Herlihy, it was probably the first American commercial film that deals with topics of &quot;taboo&quot;, such as homosexuality and drug use, in a practical way. Everyone is admittedly human, warts and all, and all are treated with sympathy. Joe Buck, Voight, is an innocent overseas, a Candide who comes to New York to seek his fortune as a scammer (a profession he sees as glamorous and not sordid, it is a cross between a gigolo and a social worker). But when he himself is apprehended by a small and vague swindler named &#39;Ratso&#39; Rizzo, (Dustin Hoffman, recently arrived from &quot;The Graduate&quot; and he is a revelation), he realizes that maybe the reality is a little different of the pipe. -dream. <br /><br /> Essentially it is a male love story, (although totally Platonic), between these two not so improbable partners. Both totally alone, both totally in need, each become the protector of the other, (Voight with his physical prowess, Hoffman with his street connoisseurs). They are maladjusted to the drift of the mainstream, tolerant of their own peculiarities and deviations from others. Although &#39;straight&#39; Voight is not beyond a homosexual encounter at a movie theater on 42nd Street with a boy even more lonely than himself. (The whole film poses an oddly &quot;Christian&quot; attitude). <br /><br /> He is also magnificently acted. While Voight and Hoffman hold the screen, there are magnificent vignettes of characters such as Brenda Vaccaro and Sylvia Miles, as well as John McGiver, Bob Balaban and Bernard Hughes as diverse clients and studies of small, beautifully drawn characters that seem to transcend acting. All in all, while the direction of John Schlesinger gives the film the feeling of a documentary, as well as the totally strange vision of an alien from the United States without rancor and without criticism. On second thought, maybe it&#39;s a great movie after all.']
