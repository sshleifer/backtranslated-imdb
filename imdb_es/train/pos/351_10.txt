It's a colorful slasher movie. That is all. <br /> <br /> It has the mysterious element that SCREAM made so popular in slasher movies, but I never care about those things. Finding out who the bad guy is is not that interesting, since the clues are all deceptive anyway. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death were witty and fascinating, and brought back memories of 80s horror movies like Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about this movie is that it is difficult to identify the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS, where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> People who do not like Slasher movies will not like this movie. As simple as that. I really enjoyed it and plan to see it again while I wait for more of the same. <br /> <br /> --MB
