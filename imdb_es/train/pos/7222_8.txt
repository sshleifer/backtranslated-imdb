Definitely one of the most fun and twisted I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and made me go through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Very elegant piece sets and accessories really give a feeling of ambience to the procedures. The minimalist feel works for the whole image. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not with the film itself, but with the lack of a decent widescreen editing of the film on DVD. I own the full-screen version (which proves that I love the movie enough to support a full-screen presentation), but an impressive Deluxe or "special" edition will surely give me money.
