Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, along with Jennifer Aniston, combine to make one of the funniest movies of the 2003 season (end of May) and a good improvement in Carrey's past, crazy personal roles in past comedies. With a bit of a tone towards Carrey's antics, but with only the zapping and creaking of his old self, Carrey powerfully takes this film to the height of laughter and also some dramatic moments full of sadness. The elements of Jim's real acting skills continue to appear in this movie. This entertaining summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with fun moments that fit perfectly with this script. Although he still lacks a highly polished comedy / drama set, Bruce, Almightly deserves the credit of being a great dating movie along with a solid message and a soft spiritual cynicism and parody that keeps his good taste. Eight out of ten stars.
