['Visually stunning and full of oriental philosophy, this incredible fantasy of martial arts is presented by the master director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the best films that Hong Kong cinema has produced. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit cerebral, but it&#39;s a refreshing change from the movies that treat their audience as if they were idiots. However, if thinking is not your strong point, this may not be your movie. Maybe you should go see the latest brainless club in the Hollywood studio, but if you&#39;re looking for something else, it&#39;s where you&#39;ll find it.']
