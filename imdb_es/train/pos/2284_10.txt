This is a very scary drama and, for the most part, well thought out. I am very impressed with the film, not only because of the plot and the excellent performance, but because of the fact that a unique film was made. Most movies that involve a spy or a war are full of a skilled Briton or a powerful battle, but not this. It is not about this type of war, it is about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, who pretends to be an evil one that no one will ever forget. When the war ends, Campell thinks he will return home as a hero, but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret. Returning to the United States, Campell encounters Nazi supporters and Nazi hatreds, providing interesting conflicts, both internal and external. Nolte more than pulls out the role, and fits the plot pretty well for what he is asking.
