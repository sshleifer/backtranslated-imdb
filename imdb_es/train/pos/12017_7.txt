"The Last Hard Men" is a typical western from the 70s. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. Also this one, but director Andrew McLaglan is a student of John Ford and this can obviously be seen in many scenes. IMO, the beginning is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the audience a journey from civilization to the desert. In the third part there are some illogical failures and I complain a bit about Charlton Heston. He has to play an old ex-lawyer named Sam Burgade, but he's in fantastic physical shape. I never had the feeling that he really has trouble climbing on a horse or a rock. For me he does not seem very motivated as he does in most of his epic movies. The same applies to the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who plays the sheriff's daughter. Maybe both had problems with the director or were not happy with their roles. Hershey and Coburn are not showing their best level, but they are still good. If the writer had John Wayne in his mind like Sam Burgade? Also Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is a bit underutilized in his role. On the other hand is James Coburn as an outlaw to Zach Provo. Coburn is a great villain in this case. He is portraying the evil man between maniac hatred and intelligence. His role and his performance is the best in the film. <br /> <br /> The landscapes and the shooting are incredible. The shooting scenes are bloody and the violence seems realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had some bloody and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie. I would have liked a bank robbery or something similar. In general, it's a fun western movie. It's not a great movie, but it's above average due to a great Coburn, a very good start and some bloody and bloody scenes.
