From the top shelf of the great classic books, comes this master story written by Pearl Buck. The book like the movie is called "The Good Earth." It tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni), a simple Chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the 'Great House' where he took a slave called O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made her his wife. Almost from the beginning, she begins to adapt to her kindness by keeping a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. During the following years, O-Lan proves her worth by constantly sharing the work, the problems and the changes of her husband's luck. Over the years, they raise a family and observe the simple climate of their home, both as a holiday and as a famine. In fact, it is at the lowest point of their lives that everyone discovers the value of companionship, loyalty and love. With the changing times, her growing family receives help and threatens with friends and family, like her uncle (Walter Connolly) who is a scoundrel and a charlatan, but who is tolerated with compassion. Wang has his 'Old Father' (Charley Grapewin) to advise him and remind him of the fragile and fickle nature of life. Two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are Keye Luke, who plays Elder Son of Wang and Phillip Ahn, who plays a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and is beautifully adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
