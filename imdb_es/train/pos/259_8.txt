For a Danish film, I must say, this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It is a class of its own, but it has international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a big budget and stars famous Danish actors and some newcomers who play very well. It can be seen by anyone who likes adventures, and a little "ghost" movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, be excited!
