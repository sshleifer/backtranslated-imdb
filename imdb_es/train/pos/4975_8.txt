By God, it's been a long time since I saw this. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The film tells us (to children) everything about human blood and the circulatory system. Together, very professionally: Disney-style animation and human actors, it was directed by Frank Capra, for Pete's sake! <br /> <br /> A kind of exaggeration. I wonder if the high value of production is worth what is equivalent to the value of a film strip of information about the human body. But boys, the children who observe him will learn: even now I can clearly remember that Hemo himself challenged Dr. Baxter to name what common material most closely resembles human blood, to which the Doctor responds immediately "sea water" .
