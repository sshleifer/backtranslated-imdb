Although this series only lasted one season, it has remained with me for 20 years. I was far and above my favorite caricature of all time. I would give almost anything to have it on DVD or in any format that I can get. If you find any way to see this series, I suggest you make the most of it. This series was the first (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent story that spanned multiple episodes. It also made me really care about the characters and what happened to them. Heck the Goose character actually scared me sometimes. He was so strange at that time. Also the group leader reminds me a lot of a combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If someone has any way of contacting the creator / rights holder of the series and can post them on a DVD, please do not hesitate to do so.
