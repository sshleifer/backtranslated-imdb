First of all for this movie, I only have one word: 'wow'. Probably, this is one of the best films that moved me, from its history to its performances, interpreted so marvelously by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with the latter, because it really gave depth to the character, since it was a very difficult role. Even so, the two formed a couple, which surprised me, from the beginning to the end, showing on the way, a friendship full of love, which develops throughout the day, based on the film. The story takes a while to roll, since the introduction of the characters is long, but eventually we are compensated with a wonderful story about love and humanity. If you have the opportunity, look at it, because it is a movie that will remain in your mind for a long time. Simply amazing - 9/10.
