****** WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ************** <br /> <br /> So, who are these "mystery men"? In a nutshell, Mystery Men are a group of subheroes who desperately try to live out their teenage fantasy lives while ruining their real identities and their super identities. Shoveller (Bill Macy) works in the construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and children at home while crossing the street in search of crimes to face them with his extraordinary and unique style of fight with the shovel. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells cutlery to the newlyweds during the day and throws crockery to the crackpot villians at night, if his mother does not keep him busy with the latest investigation. Mr. Furious works in a junkyard to earn his salary, then takes out frustration from his friends at night, throwing ill-conceived phrases at friends and enemies alike and threatening to really get angry (leaving everyone to the question, and that?) ?). Ben Stiller gives this character so much life, you can not help but love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend the night trying to capture the "moment of glory" with which they have dreamed ... become reality Super heroes Obviously, it could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all ... a flying super cop and fighter with enough corporate logos on his suit to stop one or two additional bullets. Greg Kinnear becomes a stellar performance as a middle-aged stallion that tries to recapture the attention of his fans in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To recover that "extra magic" that could win the backup again, C.A. liberates Casanova Frankenstein, an exaggerated threat of WAAAAAY to the chilling perfection of Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a "psychofrakulador" to turn Champion City into a reflection of his own follies ... and ends up capturing C.A. A few hours after his release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with the henchmen like the Disco Boys who protect Frankenstein, the trio will need a little help. <br /> <br /> Recruitment begins, and after a painful recruiting party, the team establishes with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with his mystical bowling ball apparently animated by the vengeful spirit of his dead father; the Invisible Child (Kel Mitchell), who is CLAIMED to become invisible when ABSOLUTELY NOBODY is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), bestowed mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the very underutilized Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown capable of cutting weapons in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the film throwing riddles inane and acting in excess. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a cross genre game. Anyone who wants to pigeonhole the movies into small and neat categories is fighting a losing battle. This is a spoof / parody of the superhero genre: from the pseudo-Burton games recycled incessantly (and occasionally decorated with more parody material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic genre receives a good send. But at the same time, it is also a serious movie of superheroes. Both at the same time. While it is not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this film reflects in a way the work Inverior Five of D.C. Comic), it is quite innovative for the big screen. It offers the world of comics that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws the inevitable ones, and we all know, if the superheroes were real, then these guys would be real. If the Big Guy with the S was flying through New York City, you'd see half a dozen news reports about idiots in underwear who get kicked in the ass on a regular basis. Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja throws forks with great precision, all parts of the world of superheroes. But does that make them real superheroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a comedy, although obscure. Inevitable, when it comes to pointing out the ridiculous patent nature of superheroes. Those of a line fly while the comic geniuses on the stage launch numerous bits to play. Particularly wonderful is the dialogue of Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball / father. However, it is not a comedy in the sense of side laughter or eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never really ventures into anything like that. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery Men a good movie, in the end, is that it is very attractive. The good / weak guys are finally justified and, for a brilliant moment, they really become superheroes; Justice has been served; and the film ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses are the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a big challenge. <br /> <br /> Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani is as boring and without direction as the love interest of Mr. Furious, despite having a fundamental role as conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the crazy inventor Dr. Heller, although it is worth seeing only his opening scenes that collect retired women in the nursing home. And the villains are never more than armed lackeys (a point of which is made in the movie). The cinematography is choppy and disconnected (as in the average comic, so it is excusable), music sometimes exceeds the stage and special effects are never integrated very well in the rest. <br /> <br /> However, in general, this movie is amazing. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the genre of superheroes to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun game and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> 8/10 in my opinion.
