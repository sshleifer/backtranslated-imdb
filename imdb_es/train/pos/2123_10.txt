['Of the three remakes of this plot, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and I also have a copy of this on DVD. There is only enough variation in the scripts for all three to be entertaining and verifiable. Also, has any other film been remade three times with all the star releases in each? Of course, the main stars in this case are great, but the supporting actors are also excellent. I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi. He was a scene thief that I searched to find other movies he&#39;s in. It appeared in many, but most are not available. Like the other comments, I also say - buy this.']
