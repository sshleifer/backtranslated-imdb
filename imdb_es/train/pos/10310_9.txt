Protagonist: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston. The first time I saw this movie I was quite skeptical. I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is not sacred, but neither is it a sacrilege, at least not to a large extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a time, but he is not God. Confused? I will give you the low point. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who has bad luck and feels very unsuccessful with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can say immediately that they love each other, but the relationship is in a rather unstable terrain. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce gets an opportunity for the presenter. , only for Evan Baxter to steal it without wanting to. Obviously, no, please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through television in a comical and definitely worthy way of dismissing him. <br /> <br /> After complaining and complaining about God later, Bruce receives a page. After a while he gets tired of being called, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (hehe). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the boss, electrician and janitor of the building. I found it very funny. God is the boss, the Holy Spirit is the electrician and Jesus Christ is the caretaker. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Concierge, the guy who cleans up the mess the world has left. SPARKLY. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Bruce is a bit skeptical about having met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him the opportunity to interpret God, he begins to believe a little. Ask yourself why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and abuse of enemies. <br /> <br /> As this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously becomes smarter, learns his lesson and begins to use his powers for the good of the world. In the end, he cries out to God to take it away and pray for his will to be done, not for Bruce's. <br /> <br /> As is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite funny, and there are definitely some very entertaining ones. Moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it's definitely a good try. Many statements in the film can be very stimulating and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this film. <br /> <br /> So, although far from perfect, it's definitely a fun popcorn movie with a little thought behind it. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth one or two views)
