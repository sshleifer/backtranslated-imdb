['Bacall is doing well here, especially considering that this is only his second film. This one is often eclipsed because it falls between 2 great successes: &quot;Having and not having&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1945), which paired it with Humphrey Bogart. Of course, this is not up to the other movies, but I think it&#39;s not your fault. I think there were some mistakes in having her represent a British lady of the upper class. Without any accent. I think all the strange accents distracted, Boyer certainly was not Spanish. It was difficult to keep clear of which country people were. <br /><br /> I really liked black and white cinematography. The humor is used to a great effect, I especially liked the scene of the fog. Lighting also does a great job of adding intrigue and tension. <br /><br /> Bacall is simply beautiful. Boyer just does not fit in the role of romantic protagonist for me, so he and Bacall together were a bit strange. It is not a great chemistry, and certainly there is no magic of Bogie and Bacall. But I still like this photo very much. There is a great tension and it moves quite well. I must say that I found the murder of the pretty daring girl for this period movie. <br /><br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting cast. Paxinou, as the hotel manager, is absolutely evil and evil in her interpretation. Her only scene in which she laughs maniacally when Mr. Muckerji leaves after exposing her as the girl&#39;s killer is quite unsettling. Lorre is also doing well enough in his snake and viscose figure of Conteras, a sordid coward until the end. Wanda Bendrix is also doing well enough to portray the girl, especially considering that this was her first photo and she was only 16 at the time (although she looks much younger). It turns out that he later married Auie Murphy, which turned out to be a stormy marriage of short duration.']
