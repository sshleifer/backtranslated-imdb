Now this is what I would call a good horror. With hidden / supernatural nuances, this beautiful low budget French film caught my attention from the first scene. This shows that you do not need wild FX or a lot of blood to make an effective horror movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) gradually becomes more interesting, since the film increases the tension until the end. Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrere, who has just entered the prison and has to get used to living with these other 3 inmates. <br /> <br /> I will not say much because this movie really deserves to do it. be more widely seen. However, there are some flaws: FXs are not as good, but they are used effectively; The plot leaves some mysteries open; and things become very confused towards the end, but Malefique redeems himself by the time he finishes. <br /> <br /> I thought yours was a very good movie, 8/10
