I'm sure that most people already know the story: the miser Ebenezer Scrooge receives the visit of three spirits (the Ghosts of Christmas past, present and to come) that highlight parts of his life in the hope of saving his soul and change it. his ways The classic story of Dickens, in one form or another, has withstood the test of time to become a favorite favorite of the holidays. <br /> <br /> As I grew up watching the 1951 version starring Alastair Sims, I think he's the definitive one. Scrooge, I was impressed by this version, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays a convincing and petty Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors who play the ghosts are quite scary and threatening. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern filming styles (for the 1980s) that make it more acceptable to my children than the 1951 black and white version. <br /> <br /> This is a fitting adaptation of the story and is one that I see almost every year at some point in the holiday season.
