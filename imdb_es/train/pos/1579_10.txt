I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, where he received a standing ovation. This film tells a story that, to my knowledge, has never been told, namely about the Rosenstrasse uprising (a street in Berlin) of German gentile women who married Jews at the end of World War II. As such, it is a unique story and, what is more, it is the only Holocaust film I have seen that shows there were GOOD Germans (the family that helped in "Anne Frank", for example, was Dutch) that did NOT support The Nazis, and, in fact, had the strength to oppose the immorality and brutality of their own country during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their own lives. The acting is excellent in all areas, the framing history in New York is interesting and intricate, the direction of Von Trotta is masterful in each scene and the production values, including the magnificent cinematography, are outstanding. Of course, the family in New York could be speaking German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak their mother tongue with their family, something that happens frequently. So that criticism is unjustified. Saying more would ruin the experience. The movie is long, but I did not look at my watch once. I hope this film is distributed in North America, because this film is not only a masterpiece, but it can also help to cure any animosity that people have towards Germans for their support of Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, I WANT YOU TO GO! You will be happy to have done it!
