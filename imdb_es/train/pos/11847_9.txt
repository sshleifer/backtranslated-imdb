The horse is in fact a good animal. The picturesque representations of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is just great. Fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that horses embolden through the film. Even more so when the stallion crosses various terrains, it jumps through cliffs and whitewater. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very impressive. The wonderful instrumental music invites you to appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> "They say that the history of the west was written from the saddle of a horse." Hey? Well, the story of a good horse was written from the saddle of the west. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is clearly among the best. It's one of the best animation movies I have. guarded It would be a very good choice on a lonely night. An easy 9/10.
