['Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who was horribly mistreated as a small child by his monstrous, abusive and alcoholic stepfather Barry (a genuinely terrifying portrait of Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate fianc√© (sweetly played by the lovely Tracee Newberry) and a job that transcribes autopsy reports in a local morgue. Tormented by his dark past, prompted by the bald, radiant Jack the devil (a really spooky Michael Robert Brandon), and sent to the brink by the recent death of his mother, Eric goes off the extreme and embarks on a brutal murder. spree. Capably directed by Kallio (who also wrote the scripted and sly script), with a good and uniform performance by an unnamed cast (Jeff Steiger is especially good as Eric&#39;s helpful guardian angel), rather crude, but in general the George Lieber&#39;s polished cinematography, believable realistic characters, outbursts of violent outbursts, shocking violence and fiercely unbreakable, a bad mood, a spooky score by Dan Kolton, an incomprehensibly sad ending, dirty places of Detroit, Michigan, a severely serious tone and tense, With an exciting narrative that stays on a steady path throughout, this extremely powerful and gritty psychological horror thriller makes it often an absorbing and disturbing vision. A true sleeper.']
