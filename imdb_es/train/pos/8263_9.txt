This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my favorite films directed by Pabst and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films starring Louise Brooks (as PANDORA'S BOX). Probably because both are very similar to neo-realist films that the Italians perfected in the 40s and 50s. This style film requires the use of non-actors (typical people only) in everyday environments to create intense and realistic films. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles look like miners, not actors. The central conflict when the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of a large mine, it is divided into the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, even though there is higher unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (beautifully illustrated in a dance hall scene) and World War I conspire to create a big break between the factions, resulting in a WE mentality. THEY. Later, an explosion causes a great collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit down and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they show that there is a real camaraderie between miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The film is a strong critic of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to make the German public see the uselessness. Of war and hatred. It was a magnificently moving movie with some of the most frightening and claustrophobic images I've seen. However, considering the story, the impact of the film was minimal at best. It's a real shame, like this, WESTFRONT 1918, JACQUUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestones) had great messages of peace and harmony, but ultimately they were failures in public opinion. Then, from a historical point of view, it is a surprising and sad relic that is worth seeing.
