After her Oscar nomination in "Secrets & Lies," Brenda Blethyn starred in the equally large "Saving Grace." And let me tell you, this is not the kind of movie you find every day. <br /> <br /> After her husband commits suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that her irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt. Fortunately, she finds a way to survive: marijuana. That's right, Grace begins to cultivate it. <br /> <br /> All aspects of this film were played with great success; There is not a dull moment anywhere. And I sure did not see that final scene coming! But anyway, you have to watch this movie. You may feel more festive after seeing it. If nothing else, it could work as a good lesson on how to know one's finances. But of course, there is much more than that!
