['Well, the main reason why I tuned in to see this movie is because it was made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone from South Park. However, as soon as the movie started, the laughter began to emerge from my belly. From the subtle gestures to a joke, to the cheeky mood of the bathroom, along with a constant dependence on some very ingenious insinuations. This movie could ruin the event in which he sternly faces the poker face, let alone his poker underwear. Some of the funniest blinks will miss the jokes never portrayed in Hollywood, along with constant criticism of themselves in the deal. <br /><br /> I&#39;m just going to show that Trey Parker is not only an expert in writing, but he&#39;s not that bad in the old acting game either. I was surprised by the amount that absorbed me in this movie. However, I am quite concerned that it is not available to buy over the Internet, here in the United Kingdom. Classify it guys! <br /><br /> I am, and I will continue to show it to all my friends, pointing annoyingly at the funny parts and, occasionally, snorting at my beer. In short, an excellent movie if you&#39;re a fan of unnecessary comedy. However, if you do not have a sense of humor about silly or rude things, avoid yourself! However, I am sure that the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could make you overlook those prejudices.']
