A hilarious comedy by Neil Simon that evokes laughter from beginning to end. The late Walter Matthau is the grumpy former comedian who is convinced to join his former partner (the late Oscar winner George Burns) for a final stage show performance. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matthau's actor. agent and nephew, and both have as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love the moody character of Matthau, it's the same as always, and yet it's also very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, like the distracted old man, is as fun as Matthau. <Br /> <br /> Matthau: Do you want some cookies? I have coconut, pineapple and Graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: How about a simple cookie? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm not sure. I received coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Okay <br /> <br /> Matthau: They're in the kitchen cupboard. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or how about this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I became black, the whites knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> You have to see it in the movie, to understand it! <br /> <br /> In short, a character comedy refreshingly hilarious, sweet, sincere, warm and believable with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They just do not do it that way anymore! In a time when all the newest comedies are raw, youthful and stupid, this leans towards the tender core of what comedy really is: funny characters, intelligent and fun dialogues, and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies of friends of all time, along with "Planes, trains and cars", "Lethal weapon" and "The difficult way". <br /> <br /> You may have difficulty finding this for Rent or on TV, but trust me, it will be worth your time! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
