['Here is one that the whole family will enjoy ... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall surpassed herself with this unique and imaginative version of almost all popular childhood fairy tales. The scripts offer new twists in the old fables in which we grew up and have a handful of stars in each episode. &quot;Cinderella&quot; is no exception to Duvall&#39;s norm and, in my opinion, it&#39;s one of the five best in the series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (remember her from &quot;Flashdance&quot;, and she&#39;s still in Hollywood making a movie here and there ) in the lead role, Jean Stapleton as the fairy godmother with a southern accent and Eve Arden as the incarnation of the evil stepmother. Edie McClurg (&quot;Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off&quot;) and Jane Alden make a hilarious duo like the stepsisters. Matthew Broderick is an affable Prince Henry. Everyone will keep coming back for this one!']
