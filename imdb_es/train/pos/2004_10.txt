I admit I'm a vampire addict: I've seen so many vampire movies that I've lost count and this is definitely among the top ten. I was very impressed by John Carpenter's original Vampires and when I discovered there was a sequel, I went straight out and bought it. This film does not obey the same rules as the first one, and it's not so dark, but it's close enough and I felt it was very well based on the original. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was quite as good as Derek Bliss: his performance was nice and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he could actually survive in the world in which he lives. One of my favorite parts was right after he meets Zoey and goes into the restaurant bathroom to see if she is more than she seems. His comments are beautifully irreverent and, nevertheless, eminently practical, which contrasts well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> The other cast members were also well chosen and wove very well to produce an entertaining and original film. It is not simply a rehash of the first film and has grown in a similar way to the way Fright Night II emerged from Fright Night. There are different elements that make it a new movie with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I would recommend this one. If you prefer your less bloody films, choose something else.
