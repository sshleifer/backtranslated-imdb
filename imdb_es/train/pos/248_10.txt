'Ned Kelly' is an Australian film wonderfully made in honor of a true Australian hero. They take us to the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and the other members of Kelly Gang, as the film explains and perhaps justifies Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> There is an exceptional cast present, They all give stellar performances, which gives life to the movie. (Good job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe, playing very well the role of quiet and loyal lady. I was dragged in the moment. For a moment I almost believed that the Band would win the battle at Glenrowan, but it was not like that. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are fictitious, and as an avid Ned Kelly fan (and supporter), I was a little disappointed by this. Maybe also the movie could have lasted longer, to cover more of the life of Kelly Gang / Ned: I felt that he had not covered enough. <br /> <br /> Regardless of some faults, this is a movie in motion, which moves all kinds of emotions. (And well, I guess it would be better to watch this movie instead of Mick Jagger trying to play Ned ...)
