This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian theater and film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films ever made in the category of comedy. And yet, his appearance of a play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A masterpiece that one should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles, and not dubbed). <br /> <br /> On an old bus en route to the capital Belgrade, an impending war decides the behavior of the passengers. Two gypsy musicians sing their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come; his singing divides and connects the stages in this extraordinary road movie (the Kostic brothers of real life are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic, the farmer who has traveled the road, they give a performance in real life). <br /> <br /> The spectrum The image of the characters gives a brilliant picture of a society facing a war, a vision of the collective person of the nation: everyone is aware that the war is about to begin, but they try to live their own lives as best they can, hoping that ignorance can avoid tragedy. . Using a simple film language, director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn apart by the previous war (World War I), but also successfully highlights personal portraits: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of the newlyweds, seriousness of the veteran of the Great War that is in the form of visiting his recently recruited son, and the grim predictions of a man who appears to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Brilliant in its narration, with a memorable soundtrack (especially the songs of Gispsy) and a tight, well photographed and edited environment, this feature (Sijan's first feature film) was just an introduction to a series of bittersweet comedies of the directors that will define the Serbian cinematography of the 80s: "Maratonci trce few krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota", and the favorite of my other director "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
