Working from a script written in part by Nicholas Pileggi, best known for writing the book Wiseguy, which he adapted into the movie Goodfellas, and for writing the book and script for Casino, director Harold Becker shows how the connected circles are scratched the back, even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like Pappas, who is considered a presidential prospect. When Cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mafioso's parole report, his skepticism is shaken. How did this violent young man get parole instead of a jail sentence? We meet with the other players in the plot, among whom are Danny Aiello, the political boss of Brooklyn, and Tony Franciosa, the mafia boss whose nephew was shot to death. How and why these people are affiliated, I address the film to disseminate them, although there is never a doubt of what they are. <br /> <br /> The narrative is usually told through the eyes of the character of Cusack, a Louisiana visionary. Who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him. Much is done by each one of the bureaucratic knowledge transmitted from generation to generation. Some of the dialogues are indecorously erudite, but considering that I have just described the basic components of history as a bureaucratic knowledge, it can not be said that it does not work. The case of the shootings is based on the flavor of two other subjects on the mayor's desk: a charge by Aiello for a subway stop and an exit ramp in Brooklyn to help a new banking center, and the candidacy of the city for the next Democratic convention. Individual idiosyncrasies are also explored, including the emotional bond of Aiello with the music of Rogers and Hammerstein. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of menschkeit, an expression in Yiddish, which, as Pappas explains to his deputy, is about the bond of honor between two men, about what happens between the two hands in a squeeze of hands. This connection does not mean much to Bridget Fonda, the lawyer of the police association that defends the honor of the dead policeman and fights for the pension of her widow even when incriminating evidence appears. Little by little, the deputy mayor comes to understand that the menschkeit is such an influential notion that it overcomes the law. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes of great impact, including one in which the Brooklyn boss comes home for lunch. At noon, his wife manifests his interest through the dish he has cooked, and then the mafia boss is surprised. There is also a convincing and markedly conjectural late scene between the mayor and his deputy. <br /> <br /> A delicately handled scene is the mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the murdered child, in a church in Harlem. His advisors tell him that he will not be sought there. But he goes anyway, and prepares for a blatant hyperbole speech, Pacino and his character. <br /> <br /> The reaction of the congregation is impressive, but the mayor knows, and his assistant knows, that it was artificial, and the way in which they scrupulously avoid discussing it, in the limousine that drives them away, is a subtle use of composure and innuendo. This is a script that knows he has to provide Pacino with the reason why most of his fans are going to see him, and immediately follows his quota with the reality that silence has a much more inherent meaning than speech. <br /> <br /> Pacino and Cusack are convinced together throughout the film, the unshakeable and conscientious older man, the youngest eager to learn, but with ideals that do not influence. Pacino is innate with his practical ability to marry common sense and inventive imagination, inspired style and practical realism. Cusack moves with great freedom despite his dark defensive attitude. <br /> <br /> The development of the plot of Bridget Fonda is unnecessary, but it is the result of veteran screenwriter Paul Schrader, otherwise, astutely insightful in the belief in the value of each character, and each incarnates in serious incarnations. Aiello, for example, is a highlight because it evokes the joy of life and the sensitivity of his character towards his environment.
