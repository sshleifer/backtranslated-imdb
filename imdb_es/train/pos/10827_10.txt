['Still Crazy has been compared to Spinal Tap since both are comedies on R &amp; R wash groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted, while the Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the slightly fun 10 minutes into a nonsense that makes Beavis and Butthead seem sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is a formula, but the sympathy of the characters and the unexpected high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to compensate the a priori predictability of the film. People who expect an attempt similar to Spinal Tap in satire would be disappointed by the joyful nature of the film, but would take a successful self-grilling game from Still Crazy with a pompous but failed shot of the satire that is Spinal Tap.']
