An excellent family movie ... it gives a lot to think ... There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The script is great, it's so ... real ... such things could happen in everyone's life. And do not forget to act, it's amazing! Just look at Frankie and you'll know what I thought ... This picture is not to be missed!
