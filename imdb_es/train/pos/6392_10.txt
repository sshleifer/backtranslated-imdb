This independent feature, in black and white, DV surprises, surprises and amuses constantly with its ability to create the craziest situations and then find humor and interest in them. Everything is funny and ridiculous, but as absurd as the film must be, here is a heart and a reality that keeps the film on the ground, prevents the whole piece from becoming crazy and that is where the real message lies. This film is about how we all survive in a world that has gone crazy. That seems to be the heart of the movie. Because of the madness and outside the wall that things are put, Leon, the year 30. The old paper-maker, always tries to keep it together. It is like a child who always tries to catch the balloon that is floating so that everything goes well, so that everyone can have what they want. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film could have gone very far in the upper part, but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive. Van Meter is perhaps the best of the group here with a performance that shines through his absurd tics. Like the characters in the movie, we overlook their sudden outbursts to see the real person below. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. Take the most ridiculous twists of the plot and keep them real. It's his script and his cast that helps keep everything afloat. It is a true testament to the skill of Majkowski and everyone involved that this film, with its plot and characters, never makes us nervous. Majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and disgusting, and has somehow given him heart and humor. This is a unique movie. Do not be surprised <br /> <br />
