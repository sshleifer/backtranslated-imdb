Wonderful. Absolutely awesome This is a movie about two children whose father suddenly has a vision. He states that an angel visits him and tells him that they need to kill "demons". He receives instructions later, and they begin to gather the demons, who are, at first glance, ordinary people. They kill these supposed demons with an ax on their heads and cut them, burying them in the rose garden. His father says he can see his sins when he touches them. The movie continues, with a turn at the end. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the fragility of human perception. Is your father completely crazy? Or, are you telling the truth? The public is left to decide. Make the judgment for yourself and watch the movie. Now.
