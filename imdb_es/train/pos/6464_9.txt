Wow I loved this movie! It's about normal life in a small town. On hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Cool! It is about things that everyone finds in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and "what will the neighbors think" more important than following their heart. Do not let anyone's opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and your passion. I loved the fact that all the actors were really normal people, it could have been my family. There are no great beauties, but all the people you fall in love with during the movie.
