The Haunting is a film that has a really spooky house, a good job of effects and sound, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what happened at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are really spooky moments in the movie and I liked the way the ghosts manifested in the sheets, the curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave him the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices around you. What I wish would have happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to deal with and I think he held back too much. Poltergeist scared me a lot when I saw it many years ago, and it still stands. The Haunting could have used some more scenes of pure terror. The end was for me, a bit anticlimactic. In general, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish he scared me more.
