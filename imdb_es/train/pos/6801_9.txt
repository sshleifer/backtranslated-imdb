While in the Kent Farm barn with Shelby waiting for Chloe, Clark is attacked and awakened in a mental institution in the middle of a session with Dr. Hudson. The psychologist tells him that for five years he has been delirious, believing that he has come from Krypton and has had superpowers. Clark manages to escape and meets Lana, Martha and Lex who confirm the words of Dr. Hudson. Only Chloe believes in her words, but she is also considered crazy. Clark struggles to find the truth about his own personality and origin. <br /> <br /> "Labyrinth" is undoubtedly the most intriguing episode of "Smallville".
