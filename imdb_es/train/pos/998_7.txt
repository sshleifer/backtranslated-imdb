This is a very interesting movie. It's an action movie with mixed comedy. Foxx joins comedian Epps in this film to give him a comic twist. It will keep you wondering what will happen to Foxx next. It was a well filmed movie, the director used the correct colors in this movie (dark blue colors) to give it the right feel. Kimberly Elise also starred in this movie and it's always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing, you have not seen it. It's definitely worth having if you're a Jamie Foxx fan. It deserves more credit than it is actually given.
