This movie was really revealing. I have seen this movie several times. First, when I was four years old and I actually remembered it, and then when I was 12. The whole message that the director is conveying is that everyone wakes up and does not make the mistake of leaving God out of our daily lives or simply not doing nothing. Extra mile to insult him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for non-believers and believers alike!
