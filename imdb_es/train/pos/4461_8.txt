I really liked this movie. I have seen several movies of Gene Kelly and this is one of his best. He would actually put it above his most famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that the story is lost in the films of Gene Kelly because of the wonderful numbers of songs and dances, but not in this movie. Definitely worth renting.
