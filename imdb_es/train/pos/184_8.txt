There are not people like "Show People" Marion Davies (as Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (as Billy Boone). My introduction to Ms. Davies was a "clip" of this movie; the deliciously spoofy in which he drops a scarf to reveal different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was in watching this movie, currently; However, you may have seen it on a less memorable paper. Haines makes an incredible impression when he joins Davies for a commissary meal, throwing his hat to the ring with some wonderful pieces on the dining room table. In fact, Haines and Davies provide excellent comic performances. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) taking his daughter Davies to Hollywood, it will surely become the newest sensation in Tinseltown. In fact, Davies and the already arrived Haines become comedy stars. But, Davies yearns to become a true queen of drama. Davies leaves Haines and is associated with the dramatic Paul Ralli. But, audiences prefer Davies in more comic roles; Maybe director King Vidor is offering a case for art to imitate life? <br /> <br /> Filled with excellent Hollywood location shots, both on set and off. Full of large "cameos"; In a studio lunch, at the table of the stars, Davies sits between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. The best "bit" player, however, is Charlie Chaplin, who has the courage to ask Davies for his autograph! While the cameos are fun, they and the episodic sequences help "Show People" become a less important film, and more in an important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
