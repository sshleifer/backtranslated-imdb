I really enjoyed this movie. The performance was great as well as the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is known for. The only part of this movie that would change was the end. The death of the creature was too frightening for the Science Fiction Channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this movie. Jeff Combs obviously played a Messiah figure and the creature (or shark, if you prefer) represented the anti-Chirst. There were some particularly terrifying scenes that had that "end of the world". I only noticed this after my third visualization of this classic creature feature. I know that many people will not get references to Christianity, but if you look closely, you will get it.
