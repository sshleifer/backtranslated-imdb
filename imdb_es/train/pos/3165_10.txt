This was one of the funniest and fun comedies on national television. It is unfortunate that the program is not placed among the great comedies where it really belongs. The actors did an excellent job and seasons one to six were the show at its peak. Although the seventh season was not so good compared to the previous six, it was still fun. Season 8 was the real problem. Without the show of Topher Grace or Ashton Kutcher, the show simply fell apart. I'm not saying too much, the other actors were not great if any of the 2 main characters were gone, like Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are also great) left the Show that would have the same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help either because it was not well received by the fans of the shows. I think if the show ended a year ago, it would definitely have gone down in history as one of the great comedians. Season 8 was a bit boring, but the end was excellent. I'm going to miss the show, I just hope that I wake up one day to discover that the show is back in the That 80's program with the same cast because I'm going to miss hell.
