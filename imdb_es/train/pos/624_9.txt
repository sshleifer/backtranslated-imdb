The summer has been so full of blockbusters and movie comebacks, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those reappearances, that it was a shame to find a movie that could sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> In case you do not want to read further down on the page (no spoilers), I'll summarize it here: It's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some questionable violent parts, a lot of death, and a handful of scenes with a bit of blood, not for young children), but do not try to be too cheesy or exceed their limits. Think of it as a little more serious, a little more magical, the promised princess, and you'll be close. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I am, perhaps, not as prodigious as a film viewer like others ... Maybe once or twice a month, if I feel active. I'm also a big fan of Sci-Fi / Fantasy. I get bored of redoing story lines and repetitive movies with more flashes than faster than you can count to 10, and this movie is the diamond in the rough. <br /> <br /> At the end of here (August), I was tired enough of the fractured expectations of the greatest hits that I avoided seeing Bourne Ultimatum in Stardust's favor. Having had my hopes confused by Transformers for my addiction to fiction, the Stardust previews seemed attractive to me, but I was certainly cautious. <br /> <br /> Like many others here, I was completely surprised. I thought about seeing another generic clich√© of a fantasy movie for breakfast. Do not be fooled, it's definitely a fairytale, and in fact it has witches, magic, and absolutely requires the suspension of disbelief ... But the most refreshing thing I found, is that it is NOT based on anything that I have discovered. I've seen or read in the last 15 years, and it's really a really good movie. <br /> <br /> ((Unlike 90% of the other films that seem to reappear persistently like thorns on one side, maybe a "sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas?" I could read a book this year, and in two years the movie will come out as another "epic fantasy tale, like LotR and the rest," says the NYT and so on.)) <br /> <br /> Stardust had not bolted me to my seat because of the action replete at every turn, nor was I sweating bullets due to a plot hook after a plot that threatened to rip the dramatic tension apart and echoed throughout the theater in a strong boom. It did not even use huge bursts of sound to get my attention on what's happening on the screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). I'm not trying to brag about the latest CGI techniques, or offended my intelligence with witty dialogues and story lines that are simple enough to have been discovered in 3rd grade (boy, I hate those). <br /> <br /> I just saw it. Observed, and enjoyed a CREATIVE creative story revealing before my eyes. Sure, I may have known what was going to happen for most of the movie, but that makes you forget that. It even made my heart shudder in some parts, but the most important aspect I noticed is that I left the theater feeling better than when I entered. <br /> <br /> It really is a gem. After so much trouble this summer with so many remakes and movies that did not meet my expectations, it was like a cold and cold cup of tea to finish all the hard work I had done sitting through the others trying to get out of them with the courage to my money. <br /> <br /> It's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you like fantasy movies that stand the test of time alone (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.) then you really should watch this movie. This little diamond is making its way into my DVD collection the moment it hits stores, you can trust me with this. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful.
