While returning from a Christmas shopping trip, an abused suburban housewife (Basinger) is in a struggle to survive after a disagreement with a group of young offenders takes a violent turn. <br /> <br /> Suffering the indignity of a Directly to DVD release here in the UK, Susan Montford's directorial debut may not receive the recognition it deserves. This is a shame, since the level of writing, directing and acting is very good, and undoubtedly exceeds the quality of your direct average to DVD. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger offers her best performance in a long time as the oppressed woman of an abusive husband (Craig Sheffer). While Sheffer is really given nothing more to do than to be a threatening presence, it is in his brief scenes that Basinger connects, showing a painful vulnerability but insinuating the fury that will eventually overflow in his confrontations with young people. It is a really great and discreet performance, its transformation from victim to aggressor reproduces without problems. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas At first I thought it was a mistake, since he (along with the other three young people) did not seem much of a threat. However, if the four youngsters had been more imposing physically, the last scenes in which Basinger changes the tables against them would not have worked at all. The fact that it is about four average men, although a little deranged, is the key to why the film works as well as it does. <br /> <br /> Apart from some rhythm problems during the second half of the film and a couple of nosy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that really leaves the viewer something to think about When the movie ends. Some may be discouraged by the slow-recording nature of the initial scenes or the abrupt end. Others for sometimes brutal violence. I say give him a chance, he certainly deserves more time than Saw V.
