What is contained in this album is a first level program by a first level band. This album is NOT for a weak heart ... the music is incredibly intense and VERY great. What you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the Who was so great for so long. It is true that his records were great, but his shows were the highest of the bunch. In 1969, when this concert was filmed, the screaming teenagers who threw jelly candies to the Beatles were gone and the bands (and the public) had settled into long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity, something that few spectators have the intellectual curiosity of Chasing in the era of music canned by Britney and Christina. What you learn especially here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert, it's really amazing.
