Yes, commitment. Let's say that "Fever Pitch" could trick you into believing it's a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you do not have to be a baseball fan to really enjoy this image of the Farrelly Brothers. But, of course, if you are one, you will enjoy it even more; with all the references (quite accurate, I would say) to the Boston Red Sox and their bittersweet history; of Curse of the Bambino and everything that is attributed to it, including those two words that you CAN NOT pronounce before a Boston fan: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon represent two people who, in general, could have Reflections on establishing a relationship: the successful workaholic who is also rich and meets a school teacher? What happens is that the character of Fallon wins the heart of Barrymore being fun, loving, sweet and absolutely perfect. But his friends ask him a logical question: if he is a caregiver, why is he still in the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He's been so committed to his team since his uncle gave him Sox season tickets; He has never missed a game at the Red Sox home in Fenway Park in a long time. <br /> <br /> And that delicate balance, how much is the workaholic willing to give up because of his boy's obsession? and what is the baseball teacher who is willing to commit to keep the other love of his life, is what this film is about. <br /> <br /> At first, you might think that the obsession with sports The fragments of the film are exaggerated for comic relief. Well, I'm sorry to admit that they are not. I myself, as a fan of the Houston Astros, can say that all are true. I would try in every available way to see every Stros game; Listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet. I read the sports section of the Chronicle every day. And yes, my room looks like The Shed gift shop, Minute Maid Park; with a wardrobe full of Astros equipment, which includes 5 shirts, 20 shirts and the rest. The character of Fallon even has the MasterCard MBNA card of the Red Sox. <br /> <br /> Fallon was credible enough as a loyal Red Sox fan, even though he could achieve it without becoming a caricature (Thank God Adam Sandler was not in it). ); and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to cope with the passions of others. <br /> <br /> I would say it will be a classic romantic comedy. It's not enough to be among the best movies in history; but it certainly breaks a mold in the genre and is attractive enough for men and women alike.
