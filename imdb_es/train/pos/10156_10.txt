This great movie has not managed to register a rating higher than 5! Why not! It is a great portrait of the life of Christ without the ruthless sensationalism of The Passion of Christ. John Cash did great things for God that are amazingly rejected and rejected. in areas where they should be more important, like our churches. The film itself took less than a month to film, as Johnny felt the strong presence of God guiding him through it. We thank all those involved in this overwhelmingly sincere film that will always be appreciated by their fans. At least, Billy Graham's crusade rated him enough to use him as the main source of education for new Christians. Thanks Fox for producing it. While Walk the Line showed that it was strange that this man survived and that only a masterpiece underestimated. The films are not canonized through the popular vote as this production proves! In summary, I believe that this film is one of the great documentaries of the world, since it is frank, portrayed honestly and a great testimony of the Christian faith!
