I really enjoyed the first episode and I'm waiting for more. A little soft on the front of the crime (it's almost a late occurrence and it's not terribly suspenseful) but he thought the angle of the romance was wonderfully charming. We will be seeing again for sure! <br /> <br /> I hope you have a more important role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses and that on this occasion they were little used. The actress who plays the assistant / waitress (also Sorcerer, I think) is very sweet and bubbly and is very good dorky and sweet instead of silly and annoying, which is very nice. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
