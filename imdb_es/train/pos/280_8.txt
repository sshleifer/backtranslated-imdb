Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements to the tired genre of first-person games. Tells the story of Patrick Galloway, an expert in occultism and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his farm in Ireland to investigate some strange phenomena. The game takes place in Ireland after the First World War, so do not expect to find weapons such as chainguns or rocket launchers. All the weapons in the game can be considered antiquities, but the real fun of the game are their spells and the system in which they operate. Our hero is ambidextrous, so he can use both hands at the same time: he casts spells with his right arm and uses his pistols with his left. So you can shoot and cast spells at the same time, which you understand very funny and also exclusive to this game! The graphics are excellent and can work very well at an average power P.C..The level design is also cool and atmospheric. Mainly, the game revolves around the Covenant estate and the mansion, but there are many other places waiting to be discovered as you go. Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker, the game has an excellent plot and plot (something very rare for a shooter in the first person) and I said that before a very spooky atmosphere, the voice acting is also good but not excellent. But the game has two main faults. In the first place, it is quite linear, so when your mission says, for example, go to that room, all the doors of the house will be closed apart from those that lead to the room of your mission; This can save time but restricts your freedom of exploration. Second, the fact that all weapons are antiquities may not be attractive to most fps players who are accustomed to high-tech weaponry. As for the difficulty, the game is very well balanced. Most of it is of medium difficulty, but sometimes it becomes more difficult but not frustratingly difficult. In general, death is a great game. Definitely one of the best fps there is.
