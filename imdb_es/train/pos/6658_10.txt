Mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this film. Do not get me wrong, I'm not condemning the movie; It's such a wonderful movie and I left the cinema with a lump in my throat. We need to understand Mahatma's spiritual position, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man could be separated from his loved ones. A man of such caliber guides his family and followers by example. According to the movie, he talked to his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but poor Harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father. When things went wrong with Harilall, Mahatma was able to remain calm and accepted that his son is a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If they had been other parents, they would have compromised their values ​​to help the child stand up. Mahatma did not do that, he is the true leader who leads by example.
