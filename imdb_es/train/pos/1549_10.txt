There are movies, and there are movies. Movies are often "sweet" movies, while movies are true works of art. Fraulein Doktor is certainly well situated in the latter. Like most of the spectators, I was very impressed with the battle scenes, but the intensity of the central character's representation is what I consider the film's most excellent quality. Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of Germany, during the entire process of addiction to morphine, the German high command treats Fraulein very badly despite all his efforts. The scene in which the Doktor is transmitted in the back seat of a Mercedes Benz commando car, alone, desolate and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest but true representations of a lot of "spies" in life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in the Spy Who Came in the Cold is approaching. Fraulein Doktor is a much deeper film than one can see in a singular vision. I only wish that its producers see it in an adequate way to launch it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it can do so, and those who have seen it can again (maybe again and again) enjoy this exceptional film.
