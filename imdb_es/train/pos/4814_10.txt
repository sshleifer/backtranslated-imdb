I saw this on the big screen and it was encapsulated with it. The period of the younger years of Queen Victoria is a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a girl was pushed into one of the highest roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect, the acting is amazing, the story and the attention to detail is out of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. How funny is how Prince Albert plays his mother with Isabel I and William IV! (Think Blackadder) <br /> <br /> This portrait of Victoria shows that she was once a rebellious young woman. I'm sure she would have been on the Jeremey Kyle Show if it had existed then: "My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life." <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of an important part of British and Commonwealth history.
