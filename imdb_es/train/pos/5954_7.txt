['I perceive a mixture of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here. Even stereotypes of martial arts. All good and well, and sure, not all perfectly done. However, I feel that a crucial point about this film is being overlooked ... the cultural significance of its location. The movie is set in Pensacola, Florida, and it does not try to avoid saying it. That is a bold move in the world of cinema today, and a rare gift for fans of indy movies. And, in fact, it may not be the last. Pensacola is known worldwide as a Navy city, a city of aviation, a lumber city, and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy. Rarely does it look like a city of growing cinema. But all that is changing now. More film companies are coming to film. And more and more native Pensacolans are discovering the power of cinema for themselves. This movie is part of a growing trend of indy movies based in Pensacola, and more are on the way. Pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community, and little by little, the world is taking more into account. Look and listen, world. The Penscolianos are coming. Like a virus.']
