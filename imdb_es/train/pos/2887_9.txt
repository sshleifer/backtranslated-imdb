Cinderella is one of the best Disney movies, one of those movies that I think you appreciate the most as you get older. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I consider that the movie has been the biggest of his films at the time of its release. The characters became more dimensional than the previous films, creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. Cinderella is, in my opinion, one of the best characters that Disney has created. With her kindness and a touch of dry humor, she is extremely nice; however, it is the inspiration that provides what makes it memorable. Like many people, she is an endless dreamer, and clings to her dreams, never giving up. Even in the most adverse situations, her dreams last, and she will not let anyone take away that. Your example should be an inspiration to all, and a stimulus to never let go of your dreams.
