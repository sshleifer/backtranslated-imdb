We're flipping the term "superstar" very lightly these days, but here's a guy who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I was stuck with the whole of this show. The selection of songs was perfect: it only contained the songs that I really wanted to hear and cut with documentary images during the new weakest songs. I loved that the band was only five guys on stage in a very minimalist atmosphere. (With songs from this force, you do not need a circus to entertain yourself). <br /> <br /> The shots of the crowd were also incredible. How many artists can affect the Beatles' original fans (now in the 50s and beyond), make young children jump on the front lines of "Can not Buy Me Love" and impact everyone in the medium? <br /> <br /> As I watched, I also realized that after the tragic death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney instantly became a last-minute idea. Paul not only lost John and George (no matter what their final relationships were, it must be difficult to lose someone with whom he changed the world), but he also lost his wife Linda and never seemed to really get the recognition he received for the murder of Lennon. I agree that Lennon's murder was horrible, but only now did I realize that Paul was something forgotten after that. I was very happy that I found love again in Heather. <br /> <br /> As for those who complain about the quality of the audio / video, I have no complaints; Both were very clear in my set. I think these same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format comes out; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> The only thing I regretted was not having bought a ticket for this show when I had the opportunity. Thanks to this video I could enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember his murder and then his music. Now I have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney, because, if nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first. And let's hope another lunatic does not change this, because McCartney's catalog is pretty good.
