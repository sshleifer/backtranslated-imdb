['I must say that I thought I had seen it all. I&#39;m an extremely jaded movie buff. This movie did not surprise me, by any means. I am beyond that point. But it took me to certain emotional places I did not know I could go to. I had no idea that I could ever find (ick) the idea of erotic bestiality. Never never never. Forever. Forever. But you have to go. He did it. I have to give credit to the director. He pulled it out. <br /><br /> During the first 40 minutes this movie is a TOTAL drill. We start with some very explicit images of two horses that have sex. After five minutes of this I began to wonder if buying this movie was not a mistake. Then, an old man in a wheelchair talks to another old man about two people who will get married. Then a nervous boy shaves. Then we see (briefly) a hot girl getting with a butler (but this is very brief). At this point, I was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake. In fact, I fell asleep at about 40 minutes and forced myself to finish it the next night. <br /><br /> We finally get the good of it when a girl (who knows who she is or who is in this movie) has a dream about a girl from the Victorian era who is being devastated by a beast in the forest. The scene continues for quite some time and is really the meat (hehehe) of the whole deal. It is beautifully filmed, superbly edited and delivers the products. They try to wrap the plot at the end and somehow it makes sense, but in a way it does not either. Oh good. I would definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes completely redeem it.']
