I grew up in southern West Virginia; I am about the same age as Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys", the book that forms the real basis of this moving film. <br /> <br /> And that's why I relate closely to the issue of coal mining in West Virginia and the amazing effect that Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) in all of us. The Rocket Boys made great lives for themselves. I continued to obtain my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering. All because Sputnik woke up many young people to the "science gap" that the US they had in the United States in those days of the Cold War ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it will touch the core of your being. <br /> <br /> Everyone: get it; Look at it; I recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
