['I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I were browsing the Hastings store because we had the need to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled upon this good movie. We had no idea what it was going to be, but it was spectacular. 2 thumbs up. I liked how the movie was shot, and the actors were very funny. If you&#39;re looking for a fun movie that also makes you think, I suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie. I would tell you some of my favorite parts, but that could ruin the movie for you, so I will not. This movie is definitely on my list of the 10 best good movies. Do you really think that nothing is inflatable?']
