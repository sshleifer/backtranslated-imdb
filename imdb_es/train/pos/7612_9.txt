Okay, I'll be honest, when I first saw the trailer for the show, I thought it was an advertisement for some sunscreen product. With all the people walking on the beach. Despite this, I decided to see it, thinking it would be a new show that I could laugh at. But I was seriously surprised. <br /> <br /> From the first 10 seconds of the program I was hooked, why are you lying in the trees, why did the plane crash, etc., etc.? <br /> <br /> Not every day a show that combines intelligence, humor, action and suspense is presented. But 'Lost' handles all this. With an excellent cast and crew, beautiful venues and pretty decent special effects, 'Lost' will catch anyone tuning in, and it's a must-see for anyone who's fed up with corny sitcoms and horrible reality TV. <br /> <br /> Lost is Tuesdays at 10 on Channel 4 (United Kingdom) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
