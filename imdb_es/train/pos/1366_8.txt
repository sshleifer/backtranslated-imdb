Am I the only one who saw the connection between Camus' discussion of 'the myth of Sisyphus' and Mary's life? In camus version, a man is doomed to spend his eternity with a giant rock that must climb a hill. unfortunately, every time he reaches the top, the rock slips and ends at the bottom so he can start. There may be a vulture pecking in your eyes, I'm not sure at this time. In the film, Mary spends her life struggling to unite her life. Unfortunately, every time he gains a balance, he falls and loses everything. The case in question would be the party he organizes where he gets intoxicated, offends his falafel lover and is practically attacked by Liev Schrieber. In case you question this theory, observe how this scene ends with your attempt to climb a flight of stars while the books fall from nothing, preventing your progress until you finally faint. The next morning, when he wakes up, he is still on the stairs, never having reached the top.
