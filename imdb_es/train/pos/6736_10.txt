['Riding Giants is a brilliant documentary that delves into the world of one of the most underrated sports and brings to the surface a very human and raw emotion that only the director Stacy Peralta could capture. Everything, from the structure, to the players, to the incredible footage, to the style in which it was filmed, only reinforced the beauty and power behind the sport of surfing. Of all the surf movies I&#39;ve seen (Endless Summer, Billabong Odyssey and Step Into Liquid) this was the most consistent and relevant. Beginning with the early ages of surfing (a brief history lesson) that lasted all the way to the infamous Laird ride, Riding Giants delves into the mind, heart and soul of the sport than any of these other documentaries. How do you do this? Giving us the whole story, from beginning to end, without fictions or jig jagging from wave to wave. <br /><br /> To begin this movie was structurally sound. In the other movies I&#39;ve seen about surfing, sometimes you find yourself jumping from one person to another, from one wave to another, from one event to another, without any knowledge of why or who. In Riding Giants, we have a very small cast of veterans and rookies. This allows you to deepen more in the mind of each one. In addition, instead of just riding waves, we are given more history and a more personal vision to the world than before. This is what really attracted me to this movie. I was impressed that, instead of showing all these big waves (because it&#39;s a big wave movie), we listen to stories and see firsthand what these surfers had to overcome to get to those waves. I loved the information about the &quot;beach bums&quot; or surfing parents. I am still amazed by the amazing stories of Greg Noll and his early adventures in the hard deep blue. Then, to see him in person, talk about what was going on in his mind, only more fuel was added to the fire. The simple structure that Peralta followed allowed me to continue and move away with more knowledge of the sport than with any of the previous films. Peralta shows so much emotion and passion that you can not help but be amazed by what these brave people have done and where the sport is heading. <br /><br /> Add an intense and creative cinematography to the immaculate structure, and you will have an almost perfect film. Using techniques that I last saw in The Kid Stays in the Picture, Riding Giants creates some scenes that almost seem to jump off the screen. While it is not 3D, it is the flat dimensional sensation you get when you put two images on top of each other. In this movie, it worked. It created more depth in the scenes, and really not only increased the value of the impact (man, these waves were huge), but also the danger that these guys constantly faced. If they broke differently or if they maneuvered badly, these waves would kill them. Some died, but it did not stop the sport. It only created more emotion and more passion to do it better. It is this love for the ocean and sport that brings me to my final point. <br /><br /> The human element Many of my previous adventures in the world of documentary surfing left me with beautiful waves, but very little about the people. The films knew that people were watching the waves, so basically they would go from one wave to another and maybe in a brief second about the person. This movie was the direct opposite. Peralta created this masterpiece while still giving us the waves, but devoting much more attention to the surfers and the immortal question of why they do this every day. What is rushing through their minds, what pushes them to go further, and the bonds that are formed while they are out there in the blue savage. I felt that after seeing this film I not only knew more about big wave surfing, but also about the emotional side of sport. This was an element that did not develop in the other films and took Riding Giants to a new personal level. <br /><br /> In general, this movie was brilliant. I have never witnessed so much passion, devotion and love wrapped in a structurally sound film. From start to finish, I was impressed. I would be very happy if this film won the Oscar this year for Best Documentary, and to see a new renaissance in the world of surfing and open more doors for films of this nature. <br /><br /> Grade: ***** out of *****']
