['I saw two movies during the weekend, one was &quot;kaal&quot; and the other was &quot;waqt&quot;. Both films are made in &quot;Bollywood&quot;, but they are worlds apart. The fundamental difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with &quot;Ankhen&quot;, one of the best Hindi comedy films. His casting of the charecteres is perfect. The story apparently taken from a game of Gujerati is impressive, the treatment is excellent with some exceptions. In Bollywood, when you put a movie, the first thing that a Bollywood director is prone to do is register a musical director and this guy (mediocre Malik in this case) is obliged to collect six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah has to use them to appease Finacier and grandma, who simply can not get enough of these numbers. No musical director can produce good songs without truce as this film clearly demonstrates. None of the songs has melody and are clearly intrusive to the storytelling, except the background music and the westernized version of Bharat-Natyam. The duel and the role play Father and Son is a good performance of Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His scenes of risk are clearly outstanding. A good director is surrounded by good actors and is willing to wait until a good story appears in this super movie. Then we have a producer without taste and class, such as Sharukh Khan, who will bend down to throw away and promote a garbage like &quot;Kaal&quot; to enrich himself at the expense of Art improvement, and surround themselves with limit talent and recover. The investment before the word gets out These are the Bollywood lobsters that take advantage of the unsuspected audience to obtain the &quot;Film Farce&quot; awards granted by Bollywood Chamcha and most of them are in the media.']
