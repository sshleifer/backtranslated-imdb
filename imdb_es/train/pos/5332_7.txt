In light of the bad reviews, or the car crashes, I feel in a position to start up and make a transmission to give merit to what corresponds, and make a service. I'm not sure that people have a license to say that it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to have SUSPENSE. This movie kept the suspense, is a long for me, despite any defect that may be. How many movies can say that? Not even many big ones. Due to the simple premise, you do not know if people will leave the life-threatening situation, which lasts the entire movie. Yes, the suspension was tight, and on some hits the shock absorbers did their job. It is not just a movie for television, but a movie for all the action; there is no point where you stop, deviate or turn into a conversation. It would be hard to make a movie like this, always on the road. Only duel, or speed, is this that I remember. The best thing about them was the constant tension. <br /> <br /> ACTING is not bad: the Judge is as good as ever, and the others are. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury is out of it can sometimes be, or seems to be a little bad. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily so. His first judgments are not always correct, but I think the main actors were right to participate in this film. <br /> <br /> STUNTS are mostly great, especially for a television movie. Its only flaw can be the remarkable and, once again, apparent and slow speed. But we all know how deceptively slow the cars of the Grand Prix can be. <br /> <br /> I liked that THE PRINCIPLE said "inspired by a real story". Then you will not go, how much is it true? You know what the base is. The usual "based on a real story" makes me think that it should be true. But maybe that is my mistake. <br /> <br /> HOW TO KEEP THEM: It is a good idea for the critic to suggest a tow truck to lift the rear wheels. Only a few centimeters would do. A doubles driver could do that at 100 mph. It is strange that they have not called an expert in automobiles, or a car electrician or a mechanic, to see if there is a way. <br /> <br /> I hope this review has reversed that this movie is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And help it to become an uncontrollable success. <br /> <br /> The quality of the image is a bit soft for a DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have been ripped off after the baby, but in a strange way. The idea of ​​saving lives was treated intelligently in a joke conversation to vanish it. I guess we know why. End of the movie. The suspension of disbelief came out through the upper window with the baby.
