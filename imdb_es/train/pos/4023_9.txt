This is an extremely well made movie. The acting, the script and the camera work are first class. The music is also good, although it is mainly at the beginning of the film, when things are still relatively happy. There are not really superstars in the cast, although several faces will be familiar. The whole cast does an excellent job with the script. <br /> <br /> But it is difficult to see, because there is no good end to a situation like the one that presents itself. It is now fashionable to blame the British for making Hindus and Muslims confront each other, and then cruelly separate them into two countries. There is some merit in this point of view, but it is also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did in the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British would simply see tensions between religions and be smart enough to exploit them for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> The result is that there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is the case. Very unpleasant to remember and see on the screen. But it never looks like a black and white box. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope of a change in the younger generation. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is a kind of redemption when Puro has to make a difficult choice between a man. that has ruined her life, but she has also really loved her, and her family that has repudiated her, then seeks her out. But at that time, he does not have an option that does not cause him much pain. <br /> <br /> This film conveys the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their serious flaws, and also that both can be worthy and caring people. . The reality of partition makes that realization even more heartbreaking, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India-Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to "Mr. and Mrs. Iyer." <br /> <br /> In the end, we were glad to have seen the movie, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the United Kingdom and the United States could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would surely be in a better position.
