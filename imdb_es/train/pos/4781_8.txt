['MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive David Lynch fanatic. He is a modern genius, because he is not only a filmmaker. Their stories and their style have a spell that crosses the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise for me, with its easy to follow plot and its sunny sets. However, Lynch is there and, although this is far from being the best, it is a film that should not be missed. The late performance of Richard Farnsworth is one of the reasons. <br /><br /> 8/10']
