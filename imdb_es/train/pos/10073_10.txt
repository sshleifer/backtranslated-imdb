One of the great things about many of the excellent Chinese films you can find, if you're lucky, in video stores, is that they are very accurate accounts of real and real stories. Goodbye, my concubine, the emperor and the murderer and this movie are perfect examples. Filmmakers take a true story and work hard to create a film accurately without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience, the hallmark of Hollywood and especially of Disney films. <br /> <br /> In this story we follow the last years of a famous local street artist nicknamed King of the Masks for his mastery of the Art of Change in Sichuan. Along with having lost her only child many years before, she looks for a male heir to carry out her rare and dying art in a society that prohibits women from having that kind of work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. Everything is fine as he happily prepares to transmit his art. But finally it is discovered that the son is a girl. From there, the story becomes very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera, a regional operatic style related to the Peking Opera. Farewell My Concubine fans should look closely at Master Liang's portrait of a man who plays the female role in Chinese opera. It can help them understand that the players in these feminine roles are probably not homosexuals or castrati, but rather people who have been psychologically conditioned to not realize their own sexuality.
