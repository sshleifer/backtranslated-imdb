This film is very entertaining, and any criticism is based on personal preferences, not on the quality of the films. Apart from the excessive blasphemy common in some Murphy scenes, the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor. It has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes. <br /> <br /> As a seeker of lost children, Murphy's character begins to search for a missing girl, which leads him down the path that others believe he was. "chosen" - - to protect the Golden Child. The young man is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from the forces of evil, but whose life is in danger, if it were not for the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystic assistant / guide / protector. <Br /> <br /> Also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the members of the audience who are interested in reflecting on deep thoughts. One of those scenes is where the monks of the mountain temple prove the golden child, which Murphy's character must protect. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose, and the child is evaluated at his choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy that is based on the idea that there are two good things. and the forces of evil in our world that most people are completely unaware of. As we accept this premise of the plot, we must put aside our contact with a perceived daily reality, and prepare ourselves for the earth and walls to crumble, and reveal a kingdom of evil that hopes to destroy us. <br /> <Br /> This is an excellent movie, with a good plot, good acting and, for the most part, a pretty decent dialogue that combines a serious theme with a healthy balance of martial arts fights and humor by Eddie Murphy.
