I know that it is now fashionable to hate this movie. I've seen hundreds of horror movies, including the original 1963 Haunting, as well as most of Hammer's films. This movie is not restricted and does not stop at all, which is probably why many modern viewers have not liked it. However, many viewers can accept out-of-control movies such as Scream because knife murderers are easier for most people to believe than demons or ghosts. In fact, this movie had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times and each time it improves. The director of this film has made a series of interesting and stylish films and was not trying the kind of realism of the sixth sense. The Haunting lets go and it's certainly not boring. Perhaps this film could attract more fans of John Carpenter but more to a traditional plot structure. Old Haunting was also a good movie from 1963. It was even more terrifying. See The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
