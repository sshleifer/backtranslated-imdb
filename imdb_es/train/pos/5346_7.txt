Carol, the young woman at the center of history, is transplanted to a foreign land, Spain, at the height of the Civil War conflict at the end of the 1930s. For this girl, everything is new, in its strangeness. The war and her father are her constant concerns, while she has to immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in New York. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe directs this film according to the numbers. Carol's family is obviously divided, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is an air force pilot with the leftist faction, the rest of the family's sympathies are with the Franco regime and the fascists who won the conflict. . <br /> <br /> The story does not add anything to what has already been said, much better, but it is an easy movie to watch. It shows the magnificent landscape of northern Spain. Do not expect much action, since most of what happens is about Carol and the young people she befriends. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. María Barranco is the mother of Carol, Aurora, who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, the teacher who befriends Carol. Carmelo Gómez plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left behind when he left for America. This actor, who usually has leading roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, as it remains an enigma throughout the film.
