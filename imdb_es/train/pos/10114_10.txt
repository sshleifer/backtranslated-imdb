"The enchanted world of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary about the life of man that brought us films like "Glen or Glenda", "Bride of the Monster" and, of course, "Plan 9 from Outer Space". This exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries, such as "Look Back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion", failed. Round off his surviving entourage, many of whom have died since filming, and give an honest review of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that he looks back in the darkest corner of yesteryear Hollywood, sentimental in his treatment of the director (even the disturbing music), this documentary is a must for anyone who loves the director who failed in his day. The two full hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively recreate Ed's life and premature death for the viewer. It looks best at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater.
