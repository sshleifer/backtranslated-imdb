The Secret Fury, in many ways, a romantic thriller drama (directed by Mel Ferrer) features top-notch directors in Colbert and Ryan; it remains disconcerting, if not altogether, until the end, when implausibility conquers the suspension of disbelief, as often happens in this genre. However, for some viewers, the highlight of the film will be the image of the crazy Leah of Vivian Vance, the immortal Ethel Mertz in "I Love Lucy". Interestingly, Vance had very few roles in the cinema; her real home was Broadway, where (among other concerts) she studied little for Ethel Merman. Here, she contributes a winning turn as a waitress to play a minor role in an infamous scheme; Observe your heart half-heartedly, trying to ward off the smoke when you're smoking a furtive cigarette in the hotel's clothing storage room, a transgression for which you finally pay the maximum penalty.
