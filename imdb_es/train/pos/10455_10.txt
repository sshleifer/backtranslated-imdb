['This has to be one of the most sincere and moving girl-to-girl movies ever made. While &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;Say Anything&quot; provide beautiful portraits, this film eliminates the useless subplots and divergences of Hollywood. This film focuses purely on seeing the sprouting of a beautiful romance. Never doubt for a second that the film will lead the romantic couple of these two people. Almost immediately you feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it&#39;s just a joy to see them find you. This movie is based mainly on dialogue. But, every conversation between these is also very intriguing. What makes this couple so romantic is how real it is. How in all that conversation, although often they have no real relationship with something critical, you can feel the nuances as these two become more affectionate and trust each other. This is exactly the way I would dream that I met that special person. And what makes it so true is that it&#39;s not even too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if he had had enough confidence to strike up a conversation with that person he noticed somewhere at random. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film is developed. It simply adds to the romantic nirvana sensation that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I see this movie, I do not think I get tired of that.']
