According to the story of my family, my dad, Milton Raskin, played the piano for Dorsey's band. After Sinatra joined the band, my dad practiced with him for hours and hours. Then, at one point, my dad told Sinatra that it was really good to be tied up with such a small group (band), and that he should venture on his own. By then Sinatra had enough credits "to his credit" to do just that! Dorsey never forgave my father, and the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have some photos and records about it, and also the University of California Berkley. <br /> <br /> I've seen almost all of Sinatra's films more times than I'd like to say, and his films never get old. . .
