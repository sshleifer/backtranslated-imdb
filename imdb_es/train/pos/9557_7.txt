I love this anime! I was laughing at my head with all the jokes and violence (mainly the "fianc√©e" of Akane Ranma, who is reticent but of bad temper) is so slapstick nevertheless, Ranma deserves but does everything possible to compensate. .. awkwardly. The main character, Ranma, goes to China to train and fall in the damn spring of Jusenkkyo and becomes a girl when she is splashed with cold water. From then on it is pure chaos one after the other. Among the standouts are the deranged brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy Shampoo, the perverted Happosai, who cause problems for our heroine. However, it is Ranma's selfish father, Genma, who ends up being the culprit of the disaster most of the time. If someone wants an anime that is fun, this is the one. It's nicer and better with Japanese dubbing.
