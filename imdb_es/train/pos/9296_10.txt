['I love this movie. It&#39;s weird, funny, violent, surreal, played in the head of a madman, and it&#39;s definitely not your usual comedy. <br /><br /> If you do not find the movie funny, I guess it&#39;s not for your taste, so it&#39;s difficult to write a review. <br /><br /> For reference, some other comedies that I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (that only got me the second time). There are others, but my taste is definitely unusual, and I&#39;m willing to accept that most people just do not like that kind of thing. I do not apologize for having an unusual sense of humor, at least I have one. <br /><br /> The scenes and the characters in this particular movie are well organized, the verbal humor is funny, the situations are intriguing, the acting is very good (as you would expect from the cast), although the interpretation demands made by the script are not particularly high The general package makes it fun, fun, observable and violent entertainment.']
