This is a wonderful movie with a funny and intelligent story, and the dynamics of cultural differences and the theme of what is important in life make this a very unappreciated movie. Do not let the cynics of the world prevent you from seeing this. Keaton has wonderful moments and I am surprised by the fact that comedy is never appreciated, because actors like Keaton make moving from humor to seriousness seem tremendously easy. Great movie everywhere!
