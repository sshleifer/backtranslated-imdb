"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown on cable. Not having seen it for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy. Based on the Broadway success of James Van Druten, which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early 1950s, the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned the play into a charming comedy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, judging by some of the comments submitted by IMDb, the big problem seems to be the pairing of the two stars. Who had collaborated in "Vertigo", released the same year. The film audience did not think about the age difference when this movie was released. In fact, most of the older male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women. <br /> <br /> The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a charming comedy that has enchanted the audience. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty, as it is clear that the camera adored her no matter what she was playing. Like the witch who becomes human, her Gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays editor Shep 'Henderson, is also at his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows here why he was at the top. <br /> <br /> In the supporting roles, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester, who plays Queenie, is a welcome addition to any movie, as she demonstrates here. . Nicky Holroyd of Jack Lemmon, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend a winter night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".
