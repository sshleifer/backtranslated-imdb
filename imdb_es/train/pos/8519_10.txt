Amazing ... This may have been a poor attempt to redo the already recreated Omen Movie, but I'm sure I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The last man who commented is a fool. This movie was one of the best. kind, and dark music, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would have applauded this movie. <br /> <br /> Great recommendations from myself to see or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I collect horror movies and soundtracks, so listen to what I have to say, not that other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that does not fascinate me, the endings. <br /> <br /> According to the Prophecy it is all inaccurate, including the final conflict, and left behind. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is ... There are great films ... and they should be seen, before the Great Depression falls on us and before the Democrats. Take the Presidency too. <br /> <br /> Signed ... Jacob Eder ...
