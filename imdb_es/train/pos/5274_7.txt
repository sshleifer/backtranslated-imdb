Yes, I loved this movie when I was a child. When I was growing up, I saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another copy on VHS because the old copy had been spent. <br /> <br /> My family received a VHS copy of this film when we bought a movie. New VHS system. At first, my mother was not sure that this was an appropriate film for a 10-year-old child, but since we had just bought a new VHS system, she let me see her. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie Does every little child dream? The film contains a fantastic scenario, great muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, big bad monsters and jokes that you will only get when you grow up. Then, a couple of days ago I inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time. At first, I was bored, then I started thinking about how much I loved this movie as a child and I kept watching. Yes, the experience was not as good as I remembered it? The acting is pretty bad, the story is pretty bad, the jokes were not fun anymore, but the women were still pretty. Yes, I have grown. Even though the cinematic experience has changed for me, I still think it's worth 7 stars. For the good old days you know?
