A beautiful postcard from New York. What I enjoyed the most was being able to see this with my whole family and not cowering while waiting for a stupid humorous joke to appear. Never did. My teenagers liked it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we were able to sit down with the children and that EVERYONE enjoyed something. This movie told a story that felt comfortable but not old or finished. The end came with a turn that we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and you are willing to let a story unfold, then this is for you. As a man, it takes a lot to maintain my interest when it comes to romantic movies and he did it. I recommend it and we need more of these movies to see.
