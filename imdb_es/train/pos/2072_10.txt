I was about thirteen years old when this movie came out on television. It is far superior in action than most movies since then. Martin Sheen is excellent, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as a villain is excellent. <br /> <br /> When Sheen "tests the water" on his Ford '34 (COOL) along the mountain road, it's spectacular! <br /> <br /> The ending is grand. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed by the low vote you received. I imagine that younger generations have more interest in much of the garbage that comes out these days. <br /> <br /> Good taste eludes the masses!
