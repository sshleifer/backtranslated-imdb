This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's terrible. But it's so good! It's probably better if you do not see it waiting for an exciting plot and something incredibly smart and entertaining, because you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to see it so you can see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair / bad English, a real whim awaits you. The more you think about the movie, the worse it gets, unless you have a competition to detect most of the holes in the plot / problems, in which case you have hours of entertainment ahead. I would only recommend this movie to Smap fans, bored or insensitive. And even then, the latter should be a little careful, because Goro's Japanese fans were a little upset about that, they thought it was selling. (It was not really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).
