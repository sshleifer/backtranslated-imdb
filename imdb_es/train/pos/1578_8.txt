Rosenstrasse is a moving story of courage in adversity. The women of the Reichdeutch find that their Jewish husbands have been locked up pending deportation. An aristocrat disowned by her family, Lena Fischer, is among the mafia as is the sister of General Gudarian. But rank and privilege deserve no special consideration. <br /> <br /> Nor will service to the Reich as a detained woman whose husband is in the Ostfront learn. In one of the most horrible scenes in the film, the guards take the wedding band that her soldier husband gave her. <br /> <br /> So that I do not think that this is typical of German brutality, today in the United States we have Lady Bush ordering the arrest of Madres Estrella de Oro (mothers of members of the US service). US killed in action) because their mere presence is offensive. Unfortunately, little has changed in the 60 years from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, eight-year-old daughter Ruth escapes capture. <br /> <br /> Waiting in the cold at Rosenstrasse Lena At first, Fischer is reluctant to understand Ruth by responding in a way that we consider to be typically German. Even Lena Fisher's brother, Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who knows and opposes Holocost, warns Lena against this. but Lena chooses to embrace the idea with an American rebellion that even changes the name of Ruth, the name that sounds more Aryan, Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The siege ends favorably on Rosenstrasse, but Lena laments: What happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter, Hannah, searches for her mother's past and meets Lena, 90, under the pretext of writing a personal history of the war. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that Hannah wanted so much. Looking for the family, but never noticed the fate of his grandfather, the last known to have served on the Ostfront.
