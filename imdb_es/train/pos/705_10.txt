I came across An Insomniac's Nightmare while looking for unconventional independent films, and I'm happy to say I was NOT disappointed. This crazy journey of half an hour made me wonder until the end, and the end was excellent, one of those NOOOOO moments that really stay with you. I have shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree. The little ghost girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She scared me a lot, I can say that. Nanavati did a great job putting this short together. All the pieces fit in their place and it can be said that she is a great writer of what she did with this script. So well written It is, without a doubt, the strongest part of the film. The direction was excellent and the performance was nice, but the most important factor here is the strength of the script. Good job for this girl, I can not wait to see more!
