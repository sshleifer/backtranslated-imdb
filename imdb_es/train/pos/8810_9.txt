The first time I saw this movie was aired on the now-defunct Trio Channel a few years ago, and I recently saw it again, commercial-free, at Sundance. I was impressed the first time and found it even more attractive on the second visit. Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect (Hysterical commentary by Amos Gitai stands out as a sore thumb), but taken together, 11.09.01 is a total success. The best of the show: the incredible final segment of Shohei Imamura, which contemporary critics, such as the mute Mick LaSalle, misinterpreted in some way as an attack on 'the terrorists', but now it is revealed as a controversial polemic against war; The opening article by Samira Makhmalbaf that manages to combine the deep empathy for the victims of September 11 with a prepotent concern for the children of Afghanistan; and the amusing crusade of children by Idrissa Ouedraogo for Osama Bin Laden: a search almost as serious and successful as that of REAL Osama. The segment of Youssef Chahine is a noble failed experiment that at least has the courage to remind the public that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creations of US foreign policy and the CIA, and although the study of Sean Penn's character seems out of place, still A piece of cinema effectively bittersweet. In short, an essential vision and a much better view than the reactionary World Trade Center of Oliver Stone.
