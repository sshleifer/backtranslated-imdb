"Stairway to Heaven" is an outstanding invention of film making, probably never duplicated. I classify it with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", although it is a type of film totally different from "African Queen". "Stairway to Heaven" is a psychodrama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are totally unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of black and white and color images, such as "Oz", but the importance of contrast goes far beyond the simple but beautiful effect achieved in "Oz". In "Staircase," the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful. <br /> <br /> Another bright aspect of "Ladder" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. How could someone have conceived a better way to stop time? literally? And then there is the Ladder itself. <br /> <br /> If you have some imagination, you will agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real gem.
