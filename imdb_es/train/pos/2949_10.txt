This is the most fun stand I've seen and I think it's the most fun I've ever seen. If you do not choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity, then this is not your cup of tea. But honestly I do not know anyone who has seen this that he did not like. It's been 17 years and my friends and I still quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the farts game, from Aunt Bunnie to the ice cream man, Ralph and Ed to LEAVE! There are so many individual and collective scenes of hilarity here that if you have not honestly seen this movie, you're missing out on one of the best stand-up of all time. Take either Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin or even the greats like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will get over it. I do not know how or where Murphy got part of his material, but it works. That is reduced. It's funny like hell. <br /> <br /> Could you imagine how this show should have impacted people who were used to Eddie Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and others in the SNL? If you listen to the audience when you break your first joke or when you say the word F for the first time, you are in complete shock. <br /> <br /> His first time he says that the word F is when he makes the sketch about Mr. T being a homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey, boy, hey, you look so cute in jeans, now come here, and fuck off!" <br /> <br /> The crowd erupts in laughter. Nobody expected the dirty mouth that he unleashed on them. But the results were simply impressive. I have never been harassed by a relentless comedy like I was in this stand-up. In fact, the next time my stomach hurt so much for laughing it was not until 1999, when I saw SOUTH PARK: MIGGER LONGER AND NO CUT. That comedy was raw and without apologies, and it was for the jugular, as DELIRIOUS did. I do not think it's possible to see this piece of comic book history and not laugh. It's almost twenty years later and it's still the funniest thing in the video. <br /> <br /> "I took their children to fish last week, and I put the worm on the hook and the children put the fishing rod back in the boat and they hit their heads in the water for two minutes. Gus, normal kids do not do that Gus shit, then they started moving their heads this way and the ***** ***** came up with fish, then they looked at each other and said: Goonie Goo Goo. Can you believe this, shit?! "<br /> <br /> See again and get ready to laugh. off! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
