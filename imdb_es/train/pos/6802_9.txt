You'd better watch this episode from the beginning, because if you start seeing it later, you'll be confused about what's going on in Clark's life. <br /> <br /> However, that is the turn; Clark is stuck in an alternate reality. Lana is dedicated to him. Lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he strayed to miss Clark in the pilot of the series. Marta is married to Lionel. Almost the only constant is her most loyal friend, Chloe, who still believes in who she is. And, oh yes, he does not have superpowers. He is in a mental institution to place himself in a fantasy world where he has powers, and is ridiculed for believing it. Apart from Chloe, there is a mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black man who in the alternative reality is also a resident of the institution, who believes he is from Mars. <br /> <br /> Clark must remain faithful to everything he believes is the real reality, and the psychiatrist of the institution can not brainwash him, in fact, he is the fourth escaped from the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode is amazing and shocking. In addition, it provides a new twist of the usual type of episode "Smallville".
