This is short and to the point. The story writing used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. The performance is on the whole map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has been running for almost 7 years and will end in mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat what has already been said about the sets and graphics. Considering that this is all voluntary, non-profit, it's pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> If you were classifying as a professional production, you would have to give it a 5 for a good story, but terrible. However, as a production based on fans, I have to give it an excellent rating, since with the exception of some other efforts, this is in a league of its own. By total volume, I do not think this has been matched. Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire.
