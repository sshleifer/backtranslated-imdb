What a funny movie! If you are a fan of Giallo, Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. To begin with, it is difficult to make mistakes with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful, especially Bouchet, the innocent with big eyes, like the guilty woman who fears for her life. The scenes of deaths in Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially nice and have enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders is quite unexpected and really makes the movie have a good start. The murderer, the Red Queen, is one of the most exaggerated and interesting killers I've seen in an Italian movie. The sets of the 70s and the fashions are wonderful. In fact, all the images are interesting, with the laugh of the Red Queen running across the bridge at night, being one of my favorite moments in the movie. The complicated plot kept my interest in everything. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score may be the best I've heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I could not get it out of my head for two days. <br /> <br /> The only two problems I have with the Red Queen Kills 7 Times are presented at the end of the movie. First, the person responsible for the murders is too easy to detect. If you have seen more than a couple of Gialli, you will have no problem determining who is behind the murders. Second, the ending seems too hurried and, as a result, it is a bit confusing. Definitely I am not someone who needs every point of the plot explained, but I admit that I can not explain everything. A second visit could clarify this.
