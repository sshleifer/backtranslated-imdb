When I got my N64 for the first time when I was five or six years old, I fell in love with it, and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved it! The graphics were great for their time, a good plot, excellent fields and more. all, the best music I heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the plot completely, but I think that Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser, and Mario has to rescue her. The object of the game is to obtain 120 stars from the curses in the castle. Each had about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are safe parts of the castle, where you can get more stars. But, of course, you beat Bowser. * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser in * Let's start with the characters. Mario is the main character, and he gets useful tips from Toad, so it's basically one of your only alliances. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end. The main villain is Bowser, and there are other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really great. <br /> <br /> Next, how about the? Does the graph say that the game is more important than the graphics, and I completely agree? But with its great argument, there are excellent graphics. Especially for your moment. I have many other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics do not. Compared with Super Mario. Bright colors, great effects and amazing sound effects. I found the graphics in the water courses very good. Along with those of Bowser's world, it has the best graphics of the game. <br /> <br /> Now, the music. This is my favorite part of the game. Growing up, when I played at a young age, I gladly left the game all night so that the music put me to sleep. Especially the music of Jolly Roger Bay, which was peaceful and wonderful. There are others who are also great, especially in, once again, the worlds with Bowser, they are the ones who stay with me the most and are my favorites. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite pastime as a developing player, and I love it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) PLAY THE GAME!
