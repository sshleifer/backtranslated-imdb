Lost is one of the guys ... he's so charming and full of suspense, emotion and emotions, all at the same time. I've never seen a television series like this before. It is full of emotions of the jungle and has a good script. The actors have moved life on an island in such a natural way that I feel lost on the island while I see it. It is an excellent work narrated in a very intelligent way. The series is like a movie that describes the life of the survivors lost on a desert island. I am tempted to watch one episode after another and I recommend this series to all lovers of television programs. Look at them to see the magic of being lost in nothingness.
