This filmed presentation of "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is a more beautiful and interesting version of Coleridge's disturbing poem. The amazing cinematography, combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 of world famous artists, and the magnificent narration of Michael Redgrave, are worth to see this excellent visual work. <br /> <br /> In the television age, this type of work is an invaluable tool to induce young students, as well as adults, to explore and learn the value of great poetry. As far as I know, this type of work is really weird; That is regrettable. As a student of world literature and a former university professor and academic advisor, I believe that more fantastic epic poems such as Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" should be "translated." Although I am not a film critic, but as an avid reader of classical literature, I am pleased to recommend this excellent production without any reservation at all.
