['Legendary director Sidney Lumet presents one of his best films in his historic career in this tense and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes one of the dysfunctional children. With a cast of the A-list fronted by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has captured not only elements of failed crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Ordinary people. <br /><br /> Many viewers may be confused and disappointed by the construction of the plot that Lumet has gone here. Instead of showing it in a linear way, it has traveled the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery that went wrong from different points of view, all out of order. Personally, I found this very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next. The script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally attractive to see and Lumet obviously has fun directing a style in which he normally does not go. A lot of action and suspense to keep the audience going for two hours straight, this is a rare movie that does not. I disappoint for a moment']
