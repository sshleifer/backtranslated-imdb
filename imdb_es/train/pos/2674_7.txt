If the redundancy of getting off the ship, the ship, the bus, the bus ... is a way of wasting time, then you should go back to the Hollywood movies that wrap this part in a single montage to get to the shots of money . and in doing so, it leaves you disconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life. The long travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and sense of "wait in line" that the characters must endure. Frustrating? yes. Vital? Indeed. The limbo of that trip is the key to the "uprooting" of this Turkish family. Beautiful movie with great acting. Sad, but it's worth it.
