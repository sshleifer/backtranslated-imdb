The line of the story was quite interesting, but the characters were quite flat and, at times, too extreme in their thoughts / behavior. More extreme than necessary. Also, I think something went wrong in the casting. John Turtorro really does not satisfy me playing a semiautist chess player, not to mention the Italian player. The reasons were not very detailed either. <br /> <br />
