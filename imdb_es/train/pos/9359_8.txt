The feeling of this movie was incredible. The performance of Adam Sandler was very inspiring. When he played a very restless and fragile character, he took his skill to the limit and really worked on paper. His character was really interesting. I can see myself reading the script of this film and not being so interested in the part that Sandler did to me. For someone who plays mainly comedy roles, he achieved a serious role with what appeared to be his own peculiarities and contributions. I especially loved the scene in which the characters of Adam and Don rode the motorized scooter through the city. I became familiar with the moment, because it seemed that Don was witnessing something that Adam does to get away from everything. With his video games, music and many other things he does to prevent him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter with his headphones seemed an escape from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth seeing.
