Apparently, this is the second remake of this movie, which was filmed before in 1911 and 1918. And, in many ways, it reminds me of the later film, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films refer to a cocky braggart who arrives at one of the best schools in the world and, ultimately, show the hard blow by slowly learning about teamwork and decency. In this film, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob", is played by Frances X. Bushman. And, in a secondary role, is Jack Pickford, always remembered as Mary's brother. Of these three, Pickford is the best, like the cute loser who becomes Tom's friend: he actually has some decent scenes and a dramatic moment right before the Big Game! All the standard clichés are there and the movie, because it was done many times before and since then, offers few surprises. However, it is a nice movie and a nice visualization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, for a better and quieter university film, try Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN: the football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is much more pleasant. And nice to the annoying Tom Brown. THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college photo you can find of the time. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a minor image is that William Haines played essentially the same nasty and grandiloquent character with the same argument over and over again (as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others), and if I've seen a of these movies, you've seen them all. Well done, but certainly NOT original! And, because it's just a replay of his other movies, anyone who gives the movie a score of 10 is REALLY advised to watch these other movies. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just watched and watched ¡¡This little movie was the best rated movie in IMDb since 1920 !! Talk about overrated! There are dozens and dozens of better films: how can this movie be number one is something that nobody can imagine.
