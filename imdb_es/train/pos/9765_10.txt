I watched this cheerful little movie at the age of 10/11 in 1979 when it was aired on CBS. I did not know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from the children's point of view, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars, because being a kid at that time, I found it a bit "feminine". <br /> <br /> The climatic scene in which Gazooks tickled the lights of the day out of everyone was a bit annoying at the time, but you get over that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When I rediscovered it in a video of Blockbuster in 1995, I had to visit it again! I still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit "old". I do not know where the other critic came from here who was not on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's out there. It could even be on DVD, at least I hope it is. I want to share it with my children one day! 10 stars here, it's still a great movie for kids. (final) <br /> <br /> 08/09/2009: I finally found a copy on VHS !! Woo-hoo!
