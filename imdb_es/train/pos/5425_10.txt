This, and not some Southern Soap Opera, slightly overrated, was the best epic that came off the best year of Hollywood, 1939. I will not repeat the obvious: Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. offers excellent comic performances. However, I want to mention two other less understood elements of this masterpiece. The magnificent sequence of final battle, while the marvelous Sam Jaffe laboriously climbs to the pinnacle of the temple to sound his bugle and warn the regiment, is simply grandiose. Never stop captivating me. Another underestimated element in the film is the performance of Eduardo Ciannelli as the Guru. This is not a caricature of Fu Manchu, but a well-drawn, articulate and historically informed villain ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya? He defeated the armies left in India by Alexander the Great"). In fact, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and a certain well-known figure of the 1930s (a German, not an Indian). Gunga din, anti-Nazi tract? Not quite. But still, a tremendous, funny, moving epic.
