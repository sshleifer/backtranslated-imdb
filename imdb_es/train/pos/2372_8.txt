I just saw this after my mother brought it from America for me, I was afraid to see it after all the negative comments here, but I have to say yes, the acting is cheesy, some of the effects are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But you have to remember that this was meant to be 1898 not 2005, and for such a low budget, I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed this version much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I read the book so many times and I found myself saying "ah, yes, that's in the book" almost all the time, with the other version almost nothing of the book existed. <br /> <br /> Very well done, at least trying to make a true version.
