I was very surprised with this movie. I was touched by the lives Paulie had on her way to find her "marie," the girl from whom she was separated. The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as I thought it would probably do. In fact, I hoped that the jokes of "Paul wants a cracker" will damage this film, but even that was done in a very humorous scene that becomes very moving when Paulie is at the press conference of the research lab. So if you want to see a good movie of "talking animals", take a look at this, much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a touch of surprise at the end that is also done very well.
