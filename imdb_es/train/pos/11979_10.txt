I try to see him every day most of the time, and although I've seen him for the past 4 years, I have not seen all the episodes. <br /> <br /> The program is about Danny Tanner, who is the guy who does it. News for sports. His wife is killed by a drunken driver's car accident and asks Jesse, an Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession with his hair. Joey, an adult girl who makes comedy and voices cartoons all the time to take care of her three girls, Donna Joe, call her DJ, Stephinie, who is the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> Everyone lives under the same roof with no one to help them. <br /> <br /> Later in the program, Jesse gets a girlfriend and then marries her and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (This starts to happen in the new seasons) This show is amazing, if you like the life of The Suite of Zack and Cody, Raven, the world of Boy Meets and Designing Woman, you will love it. (Begins to improve in the final seasons) Look at it, you will love it!
