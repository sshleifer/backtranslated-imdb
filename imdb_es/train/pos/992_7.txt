I had no expectations; I had never heard of Jamie Foxx; All I knew was that the movie has some strong character actors in it. I thought it was very entertaining; It was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to keep my interest. For me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is fantastic (true, this is not his best role). I thought that the persecutions and the pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done. I did not expect much and I was pleasantly surprised.
