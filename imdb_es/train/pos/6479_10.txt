This is a fantastic series first of all. It's very well done and it's very interesting. As a great fan of the Second World War, I had learned a lot before watching this series. One of the best things to do this is all the interviews with people from the past when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking. It is nothing against men what is interviewed in today's programs, it is just that most of these men were not really involved in the higher echelons of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the narration of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about World War II, but I really believe that only enthusiasts (like me) will want to buy it or see it more than once. My only real complaint about this whole series is that some of the facts are not as accurate as we know now. Especially with information about the Soviet Union it is exaggerated or simply inaccurate in some places. That information is now different, now we know it due to the fall of the USSR. In general, a fascinating look at the Second World War and a must for any professional historian or World War II staff to be serious.
