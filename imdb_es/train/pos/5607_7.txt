Once I saw The Tenant and I interpreted it as a horror movie. It uses many of the tropes of the genre: the sinister apartment, suspicious neighbors, apparitions, mysteries, hallucinations. The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, seemed to be surrounded by evil and secret forces that tried to drive him crazy. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw him I challenged this initial interpretation. If this movie is a horror movie, it's just horror in the sense that a Kafka novel is horror. In fact, this film can be understood literally as a lonely man who goes crazy slowly without any external influence. <br /> <br /> Polanski made three films in his career that deal with madness: Repulsion, which does not particularly interest me. I like it because the development of madness in heroin never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, in which the heroine goes crazy by the forces of evil; and The Tenant, which could be the best study of paranoia that has been done in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with her and little by little he becomes her: she dresses her clothes, she puts on make-up, she talks like her. But is he being possessed by a spirit, or is he simply letting his unbridled imagination get the best of him? It is this hesitation between what is real and imaginary, and what Polanski never solves, which makes this film so fascinating. Many events in the film can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as to normal causes, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> Although this is not my favorite Polanski movie, however, it is a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms. And technically speaking, it is also wonderful. Suffice it to say that he collaborates with film composer Philippe Sarde and legendary cinematographer Sven Nykvist (DP of Bergman) in the making of this film. A slow pace and sometimes uninteresting segments can make this film difficult to enjoy, but nevertheless it is an experience.
