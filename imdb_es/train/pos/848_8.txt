The turning point in "The Matador" reaches the middle of the film when Danny, an unsophisticated man from Denver, is sitting on the balcony of his hotel in Mexico City, enjoying a moment of tranquility. Someone knocks on his door and, knowing that it is Julian, the hit man, refuses to answer. But he really? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, the director of "The Matador", presents us with a character, Julian Noble, who does not show redeeming qualities. In fact, we've already seen it in action, doing what it does best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real bar in Mexico City, he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living. <br /> <br /> Danny, who has come to sell his show to a Mexican company, but seems to be competing against a local team that seems to be in front to get the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls prey to the charisma and charm of the intelligent Julian. It is not until some time later, on a cold winter night, that the killer appears at Danny's door asking his friend to return a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It is at this point that the secret that unites them is revealed in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, acting against the guy, makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble. Just seeing him walking through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots gives the correct impression about his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, interprets the straight part of this strange couple. Hope Davis appears only in a couple of scenes, which leaves us sorry why he did not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall is presented as the link between Julian and his assignments. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard leads with style working with his own material. The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and the clear cinematography of David Tattersall enhances everything.
