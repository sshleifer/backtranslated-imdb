This was a favorite Christmas Special that I would like them to release on vhs or dvd, since my 33 RPM was lost, and all the cassettes I made are also gone. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a great John. The Denver fan, but he was very impressed with the music, which was mostly traditional favorites with a touch of muppet (especially Little St. Nick!) It also contained some little-known songs (originals?). <br /> <br /> Although it was made in the late 70s. This show had a timeless feel. Hoping to find a copy soon!
