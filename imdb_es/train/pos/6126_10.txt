I saw Jack Frost for Â£ 4: 00 at my local store and I thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie, so I bought it and he was right, it was good. For starters, this movie is about a killer snowman, so there's something to laugh about and it looks fun compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The performance was good and the lines that Jack Frost said made me laugh "I just took you off for smoking" and "The slower worlds ** of the snow cone" How funny and funny is that ? The story at the beginning was quite funny and silly too: "Jack be agile, Jack be quick, Jack took out his eyes with sticks of candles". If you're looking for a B-Movie comedy horror that is full of puns, then check out Jack Frost. 10/10
