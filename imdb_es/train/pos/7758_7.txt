An exaggerated melodrama typical of his time (mid-1950s) and appropriate matinee food. Rock Hudson, the giant that everyone always falls in love with, plays his usual stereotyped role, but while in Giant, he did it the same year, when his material and his supporting stars (Taylor & Dean) were above the Average, in this film is simply not good enough to raise the caliber beyond a soft story of how difficult it is to be rich and happy at the same time. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, who makes his way through the film in a drunken stupor, and Dorothy Malone, playing a poor poor little girl all over) end losers and Hudson receives Bacall, who is rather Wood in this part that does not have enough character or ingenuity for her to get going. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the happy good ending and the unhappy evil, that is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested to read that the film is based on a true story that vindicates the plot. Like other films of the time, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Maybe the movie could be remade: Stack's character would sound truer if he hid Mitch's homosexual feelings when he married. The Far of the Sky by Todd Haynes improved greatly in All That Heaven Allow, also directed by Sirk. Maybe Haynes could remake Written on the Wind and give us a really memorable movie.
