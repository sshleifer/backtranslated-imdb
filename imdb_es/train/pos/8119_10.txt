I think the first 20 minutes of this movie is perhaps one of the most exciting films, with the brilliant musical score working to create tension in a devastating climax. What movie buffs did about this in the 1930s, I can only imagine it. The 'Times' said at the time: 'A miracle has arrived on the screen'. Look at it and be amazed.
