Who does not have unresolved problems with parents? And what parents do not have unresolved problems between them? <br /> <br /> I know, that sounds heavy. But this is played for laughs in the film, improving both comedy and drama. I've always liked Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a little concerned that his star qualities were too big for a small movie, I loved it from the first scene. <br /> <br /> Especially entertaining It was the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person. And Peter Falk's monologue about being a father and a husband who sacrifices and works hard was the perfect balance point. Without the scene acting so well, the film would have seemed much less nuanced, and the character less interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul and Peter!
