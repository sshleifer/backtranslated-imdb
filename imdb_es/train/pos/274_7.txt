I see most of the films in which Nick Mancuso is, because, frankly, I love the boy, although as he gets older he's usually chosen as the bad guy (long-time fans should keep in mind that for some reason he's blond in this movie). It's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot (but most movies these days are not exactly original), but Rick Roberts is attractive as the imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac is just as attractive as the daughter, and Mitzi Kapture makes an good job, if that was his goal, to be angry and, sometimes, hard enough to like. Nick still has it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. However, much of the plot takes place off the screen (such as motivation, previous behavior, good and bad times) and the things that seem obvious to the characters never reach the audience (that is, to me). The final scene leaves everything that is desired in the category "but what about ...?", And in general, I can not say that I have cared much about any of the characters. That said, it was what it was, a pretty entertaining way to spend the afternoon, and I still like Nick.
