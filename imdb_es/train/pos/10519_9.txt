I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and besides being a feature film (a real fan wants to see as little as possible and that can only be achieved in a miniseries) it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the rich girl, a little clueless but well-intentioned, and Jeremy Northam is Mr. Knightly with his poise and nobility. I was not thrilled with Ewan McGregor, although I liked him a lot as an actor, but I did not feel like the movie was going to spoil. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen there were things that I would have liked to see included that they were not, but that would have made it much more permissible for a feature film and, as expected, I felt that they really summed up the story. all right. I have seen all the adaptations of this book and I felt that this was the best!
