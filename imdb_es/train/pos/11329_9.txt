The combination of the magnificent black and white photography and the plot 'Eugene Onegin with a twist' made this a real coup de grace for me. The atmosphere created by the shots, mostly very dark, in contrast to the occasional very bright overexposed white, was exciting. There was a magnificent moment in which transparencies were shown, apparently conventional, but the actors' faces revealed the character and the situation in a subtle but instantaneous way, accompanied by Lensky's heartbreaking aria from Tschaikowsky's Eugene Onegin opera. <br /> <br /> For me, the best thing about a good movie is that you should take advantage of the opportunities that medium offers, which means that history is often less important than images and atmosphere. Last year in Marienbad is a good example of a movie of this kind. . Krisana is in the same mold.
