I discovered that Gray Garden is an exciting movie, an incredibly intimate image <br /> <br /> to the eccentrics who basically have the right idea: to forget society <br /> <br /> and live in a ramshackle house without heating and an immense <br /> <br /> breeding cats and raccoons, pursuing their own interests instead of <br /> <br /> mundanely, all the time chatting with the camera. <br /> <br /> Great Edie and Little Edie are the two madmen that the Mazles Bros. <br /> <br /> have chosen to document. They look like characters outside of a Fellini movie <br /> <br />, just strangers, if that makes any sense. Old Edie is almost completely prostrate in bed, a pile of dirty papers, clothes and dishes <br /> <br /> growing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She <br /> <br /> walks around the house, always wearing a baboushka headdress <br /> <br /> around her head, completely covering her hair. <br /> <br /> We never saw her hair throughout the movie, nor did we get a clue <br /> <br /> that she still has a lot. However, at the age of fifty-eight, it is still beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> At Gray Gardens, we have the feeling that both women <br /> <br /> lives have become much less than they once were. The little one <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the saddest of the two. While his mother, in his previous years, married, formed a family, lived luxuriously and even made some recordings (the scene where, at 77, sings <br /> along with a recording of "Tea for Two" that he made decades ago is <br /> <br /> one of the best scenes in the film), Edie left his promising career as <br> /> <Br /> model to take care of her sick mother. At 58, she still longed to find her charming prince. If anything, Little Edie is still a little girl, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of glamor and fame, and of domestic and romantic happiness <br /> <br />, which have not yet been fulfilled . <Br /> <br /> The highlight of the film includes the opening moments, where Little <br /> <br /> Edie explains her dress to the camera, the "tea for two" sequence, <br / > <br /> the birthday party, the climactic argument, the food delivery scene <br /> <br /> and the scene in the attic. Everything is incredibly <br /> <br /> sincere and unpretentious. And it has become even more remarkable <br /> <br /> since everything is real. <br /> <br /> I suggest seeing the Gray Gardens with the Kenneth <br /> <br /> Puce Short Moment of Puce. The Criterion DVD costs $ 35.00, but is worth <br /> <br /> every penny.
