['A financial and critical failure when it was launched for the first time, the critics turned around and declared that this film is one of the best of the Director. La Ronde likes the film to develop quickly as the guys from a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) chase, fall in love and fall in love with some of the most extravagant women and beautiful views in the movie (Audrey Hepburn Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Much of the script was improvised or rewritten on the day of filming, which gives the film a breeze. Ben Gazzara is excellent as a chief detective chasing Audrey Hepburn after dropping the singer Colleen Camp and seeing taxi driver Patti Hansen aside. John Ritter, ineptly, follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has some girls he is chasing (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has some great performances from a great cast. The standouts are Audrey Hepburn (she does not have a line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead) and Colleen Camp has one of her best roles as the country maniac singer Christy Miller. It is a pleasure to see her shooting her lines in a delivery of rats and tattoos. Highly recommended! ********* stars!']
