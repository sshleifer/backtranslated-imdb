My dog ​​died recently, and this was a movie that I loved when I was a kid, so I had to see her to try to cheer me up. <br /> <br /> (Beware of the dog, I mean Spoilers). This movie is not It's not just for kids and it's far from normal. It was set in New Orleans in 1939. In the first place, the dog was not represented as an extra member of the family in this film, but as an adult with his own life complicated to deal with. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, Charlie is not very different from his dishonest and brutal business partner, Carface. He is driven by money, greedy, and has just escaped death row, as he states at the beginning of the show. The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others; Anne Marie and her partner, Itchy. Carface will not even hear the fat, ugly dog ​​with the big glasses that are closest to him. <br /> <br /> Carface tries to kill the hero, because he wants 100% of the profits in his business and will not settle for just 50%, a very unusual way to die of a German shepherd mix. Also, being eaten by a prehistoric alligator that ends up forgiving your life because you can sing is very unlikely that you are a dog or not. This is a caricature, and that's why it's logical here. <br /> <br /> Carface's revenge method is through murder, while Charlie believes that success is the best revenge, which is financial success. After surviving the death, he starts a business taking the funding source of Carface, a very talented girl who has the ability to communicate with animals. They win a lot of races, and Charlie tells him he will give the money to the poor. Indirect: Charlie and Itchy live in a junkyard, and therefore are poor. Use the money for your casino / bar / theater, and not for the other "poor". The reason that Anne Marie has the ability to talk with animals is that she has compassion and listens carefully. She teaches Charlie the ethics by pointing out his game, lying and stealing. Charlie tries to compensate by buying his clothes. He added the ethics that his business needed, while Charlie took over the administration, and Itchy provided the construction. <br /> <br /> Carface uses violence and property damage to knock down Charlie's businesses, which are not protected by the government. Charlie loses everything and all that is left is this girl. In the end, he had to choose between his life and his. First he grabs the clock of self-preservation and places it when the girl begins to sink. Both the girl and the clock were sinking, and he had to choose which one, and he chose the girl. <br /> <br /> The great part of this film that focuses on a person's ability to learn from good with evil over time. And a child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of his pet's death is that he never shows anyone dying! The clock symbolizes his life, and the clock is shown submerged and stopped. All the deaths were suggestive, even for the villain. I have not cried during this movie until now, and I have obtained much more than that, that I had to write it and share it with you.
