A simple movie at the beginning, a simple movie at the end. It has that endless and faked clich√©, but, most television movies have that form. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job of being an ex-con / drifter. The marriage between her and the woman she works for, I think it's a little weird, but, I think for the period of time established, it is, however, credible. <br /> <br /> Now, I saw the edited version of 'tv', even though the movie was made and shown on 'tv', it seems a little weird too. But, I feel that if I saw the whole piece, I would most likely give it the same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, it's not his best role, but still ... it's a good job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
