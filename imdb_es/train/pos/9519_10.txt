Tom Hanks has been in such successful films as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. For the most part, their roles have been good for those we encourage. In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivan is a bit different. <br /> <br /> In the film Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, it shows the story of a man and his son. on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What's different about this little road trip is that Sullivan is a hitman who is now being hunted by his former partner. His boss or former boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him almost more than his own son, Sullivan's partner, Connor (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> After a job done incorrectly due to Connor, the only Witness to his mistake is Sullivan and his son, who was not supposed to be there. Then Connor tries to get Sullivan and his family out, but only gets the wife and the other son Peter. Sullivan overcomes success and runs home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting. With his wife and son dead, Sullivan heads for the road in search of answers. <br /> <br /> The story follows the two of them while Sullivan tries to do things well in memory of his wife and son, and of Michael, who feels that way. He is to blame for all this. He feels that his curiosity killed his mother and his brother. Tyler Hoechlin does an excellent job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also the feeling of being still young. His loss of innocence is well represented when he travels from city to city, leaving nothing behind. <br /> <br /> Mendes' previous movie was American Beauty, which received five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. This film did not fare so well at the Oscars, it only won one award for the best cinematography, but received five other nominations for music, sound and Best Actor in a supporting role for Paul Newman. This photo is a great story that takes you on a journey through the Midwest and to the legend of Mike Sullivan: husband, hit man and devoted father. This movie is a sleeping movie that must be seen for years to come.
