A question that must be asked immediately is: Would this film have been made if the women were not aunt and Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis's cousin? <br /> <br /> The answer is: Probably not. <Br /> <br /> But, fortunately, they are (or were) Jackie's cousin and aunt. <br /> <br /> This Maysles brothers documentary about the existence (one might call it life) of Edith B. Beale, Jr., and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie), have the same appeal of a clash of trains: you do not want to look, but you must do it. <br /> <br /> Great Edith and Little Edie live in a magnificent mansion in East Hampton, New York, which is slowly decaying around them. The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle. <br /> <br /> Magnificent oil painting leaning against the wall (with cat feces on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them when young women compete for space on the walls next to old magazine covers . <br /> <br /> Living alone together for many years has brought down many barriers between the two women but has erected others. <br /> <br /> Clothing seems to be optional. Edie's favorite disguise is shorts with pantyhose thrown over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped around her torso and head. <br /> <br /> As Edith says "Edie is still beautiful at 56". And indeed she is. There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that was once there. <br /> <br /> There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Your eating habits are (to be polite) strange Cream of ice cream in cookies. A dinner for Edith's birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served in fine china with plastic utensils. <br /> <br /> Time is irrelevant in your world; as Edie says "I do not have watches". <br /> <br /> His relationships with men are very strange. <br /> <br /> Edie feels that Edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness. She says: "If you can not make a man propose to you, you could be dead." To which Edith responds: "I'll take a dog any day." <br /> <br /> It's obvious that Edith does not see her role in Edie's lack of male company. At the beginning of the film, he states that "France fell, but Edie did not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's hard to hear exactly what is said, both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other. <Br> <br /> There is a strange relationship with the animals throughout the film, Edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food.The cats (and there are many of them) are everywhere. <br /> <br /> At one point, Edie declares that "the hallmark of the aristocracy is responsibility." But it seems they can not take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a movie Hard to see but well worth the effort.
