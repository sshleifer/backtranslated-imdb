I loved this movie. Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he is in virtually every German film that counts. But also because he is not the main actor. Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to see Julietta in 2001, and who really carries this film on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> A family moves from Italy to Germany in search of "the German dream". (This is my own invention and ironic ...) of cheap labor in the steel and coal industries. However, they end up opening a restaurant and the trip that the film takes to this point is only so poetic and at the same time fun and charming. From this point on, the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with her brother and her mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can be shaped by the choices you make. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie does not say which life (from Gigi's or Giancarlo) was more successful or more complete or more interesting. It simply gives us a rewarding insight into how the search for identity should be when it comes to two countries and mentalities. and this aspect is not driven by bitterness or disdain towards either of the two countries, which makes it an excellent film for each and every one of the countries that face the tensions resulting from immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin has moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also gives this film a great measure of its credibility and emotional precision. The icing on the cake are fantastic performances of the whole cast, especially Metschurat and, this is what I really must underline, the little boy who plays the young Gigi. The performance of that child would be a difficult act for anyone to follow! Great movie, go see it.
