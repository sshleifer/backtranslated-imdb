['Six degrees had me hooked. I expected it to come and I was totally disappointed when Men in Trees replaced its place in time. I thought it was paused and would go back to the beginning of 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it ended. We could relate to the characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and we had our favorite characters. There was no one in the program that I did not like and I felt that the performance was excellent. I always like to see programs recorded in cities where local areas can be identified. For my part, I would like to protest the cancellation of this program and ask you to return it and give it another chance. Give it a good space of time, do not keep moving it from this day until that day and announce it so that people know that it is on.']
