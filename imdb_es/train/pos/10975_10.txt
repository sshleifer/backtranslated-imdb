The words of the daughter are poetry: "I can not continue another year, I have to go to a hotel room." "I lost my blue scarf in a sea of ​​leaves". "The marble faun is moving in ... he just gave us a washing machine, that's the deal." "I'm pulverized by this last thing." "... raccoons and cats get a little bored for a long time." "... any rat's nest, mouse hole that I would like more." And there is wisdom in the words of the mother: "... yes, pleasure is all mine." "This little book will keep me straight, straight as a dye." "You always have to do everything correctly." "Where the hell did you come from?" "... bring me my little radio, I have to have some professional music." "I'm your mother. Remember me?" The mother / daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film. This is a movie of Mother's Day.
