This really is a great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dance of Fred and Ginger is among the best in its history. But basically, all the Fred and Ginger films are the same. Once the singing and dancing ends, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the secondary plot of the film is the reason why I see this again and again. He joins this movie, he does not subtract it. He has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is on my list of the ten best favorites of all time. It's great to see him as something more than a cowboy. Okay, he's not really a great actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. It was very nice and could reach the top on certain occasions. All the films of Fred and Ginger had secondary plots that depended on other actors to complete the space between the musical numbers, otherwise, the film would have to be reduced in about half an hour. I just wish more people would appreciate Randy and I felt the need to defend him.
