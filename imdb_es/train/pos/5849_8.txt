Damn, this show was amazing today and even today continues to eclipse the cartoons. I can not wait to locate some of the DVDs to share with my little one and see the same sparkle in their eyes. I already introduced Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles) and I laughed when he said one day: "Dad ... I'm sure you saw some amazing cartoons when you were a kid!" How good is that. <br /> <br /> Come on Hollywood, dust off this and give it a live action attempt. It could not be worse than Spiderman 3 was ... Man oh man ... 2007 has been pretty scarce so far for summer movies. <br /> <br /> Ok, I'm going to take a break now <br /> <br /> Regards
