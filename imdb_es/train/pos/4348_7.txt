Paul Reiser moves away from the focus of comedy to write a warm and humorous story about the family: what we see and what we do not see, what we expect and what surprises us. WHAT ABOUT MY FOLKS does not set new standards for the film, but it's a well-told little story that reminds us of the significant links that the family represents. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, sometimes pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) in the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she leaves! His daughters, along with Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately begin searching for his whereabouts, leaving Sam confused and hurt and disgusted to fix things on a road trip with his son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who they are from each other and what each one means for their father and son status and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and presents the now workaholic Ben with the pleasures and fun of living. The trip ends with a phone call about Muriel's whereabouts and why she left and the regrouping of the wisest family draws the warm end of the story. Everything is not what it seemed: it is better and, well, different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser are playing like the professionals they are, but in many ways, the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs in the movie. Well worth seeing. Harp grady
