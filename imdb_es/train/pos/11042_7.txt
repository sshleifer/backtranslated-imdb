In a penitentiary, four prisoners occupy a cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit fraud and was betrayed by his wife; the dragon Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protege, the late Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six-month-old sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an old newspaper hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and deals with black magic. They decide to read and use their content to escape from prison, when they find the truth about Danvers' fate. "Maléfique" is a low-budget, original, intriguing and claustrophobic French horror film. The story is practically in the same place, it has no clichés and it grabs the viewer's attention until the last scene. I am a big fan of French cinema, generally romances, dramas and police stories, but I noticed that recently I have seen some good French horror films, like "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("Signs of evil")
