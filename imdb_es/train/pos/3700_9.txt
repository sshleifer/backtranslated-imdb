Cameron Grant is one of the best directors who make films for adults. His only rival is Andrew Blake. Celeste is dynamite throughout the movie, but the sequence of the DR office with her and two other women is simply amazing. Almost as good is the performance of Asia Carrera with the construction worker. I recommend this movie and I gave it a 9. It's almost as good as Cameron Grant's DESIRE ELEMENTS, which I gave him a 10.
