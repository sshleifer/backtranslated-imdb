By chance I saw this movie twice or more and I found it well done! World War II had just ended and the so-called "Cold War" was about to begin. This film could, therefore, be defined as one of the best "propaganda", the patriotic films that prepare Americans and, secondly, the people of the "Western NATO bloc" that has not yet been formed to face the next threat. The film celebrates the power of the USA UU Throughout the centuries, while projecting towards the current war, which had just ended. Pleasant and fun is the way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Columbus and the beautiful "espisoda" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from a drunk local Indian. You must see it (at least once, out of curiosity of propaganda fashion through time)! :)
