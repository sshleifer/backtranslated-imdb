['Starfucker (which reads Starstruck in my box) was the most amazing movie I&#39;ve ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in my life. So, why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy demonstrates why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting aspect of a darker side of Hollywood. I forced some others to watch the movie and everyone agreed that it was an excellent movie.']
