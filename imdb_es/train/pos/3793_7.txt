['This is the first American film to successfully adopt the naturalistic style used by Europeans, particularly the French and Belgians, for at least a decade, is not it time? After three high school girls in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn during the last days of her summer vacation between the first year and the second year, she does what all good art should: discover the universal in the particular. Although the concerns of the girls are apparently conventional (children, sex, popularity, money, freedom and clothes) we can see how they are configuring all their lives, the universal interface between character and destiny. <br /><br /> Naturalism is everything, complete. The film breathes, stays in the moment, lives in real time. The story tells itself. The medium and its artifacts, for once, are not the message. The film, without hesitation, sincerely transmits the childlike perspective of its characters; it does not impose its own adult or moral meanings. The details arise on their own, they are never mentioned, and therefore seem more real and powerful for their underestimation. Although great efforts have been made to capture the real social reality of Crown Heights, part of the largest black ghetto in New York City and one of the most dangerous places in the US violent. UU., The theme is childhood in the ghetto, not the ghetto. itself. <br /><br /> Documentary images of the practice sessions of a band, Jackie Robinson Steppers, punctuate the film at regular intervals with an explosion of color, movement and sound. Otherwise, the camera remains very close, very intimate, as a patient, astute and discreet observer. The language is rich, spontaneous, transparent acting. Some scenes stand out, like the girls loitering around, each of which reveals their deepest fantasies. Lanisha&#39;s confession of her acceptance of a death by random violence is the most shocking, one of the ghetto&#39;s deepest scars. The fact of sharing with her mother her confusion and fear of the hard challenges of adult life is equally moving and beautiful, without sentimentally affirmative. <br /><br /> Social realities are respected, not propagated: the three girls are being raised by single mothers, only one, Lanisha, has an active father in their life (and, not coincidentally, of the three is the most emotionally stable and empathetic with the others, and the one of greater self-esteem). Two of them suffer from asthma, a disease that prevails disproportionately in the center of the city. The shots, an accepted daily occurrence, only interrupt their conversation momentarily. Only one of the girls, Joy, feels hope, feels that she has control over the future, while the other two, in varying degrees, have already accepted despair. <br /><br /> This is, by far, the best dramatic American movie I&#39;ve seen in years. See it, see it, see it']
