['The fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. This movie is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed. The museum scene is like a good music video. The sexual scene apres is a very familiar scene in all our adult lives. but the movie would have no interest for me without Keith Gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. almost everything I know about acting comes from studying mainly their eyes. He had the most convincing face. Your character has the qualities that I look for in a boy, sensitivity and dedication. Keith Gordon is beautiful. By the way, I wish he had shaved his beard now, since his lips, Adam&#39;s jaw line and Adam&#39;s apple were his prettiest set next to his eyes.']
