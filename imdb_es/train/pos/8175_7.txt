['Before I start, I&#39;m afraid of dentists. This movie gives me the creeps and it even makes me tremble. That&#39;s what I love about this movie. The movie is a bit boring. For that, I take away 3 stars! <br /><br /> * Spoiler alert * <br /><br /> The film revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone, who has just discovered that his wife has been cheating on him. Soon, he begins to hallucinate and begins to torture his patients, killing coworkers, and even tortured his wife to death and killed the man with whom he was having an affair. <br /><br /> * End Spoiler * <br /><br /> The movie is very bloody and bloody. I would recommend it if you are in gore. <br /><br /> I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your usual dentist every day!']
