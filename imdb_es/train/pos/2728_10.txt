Simply one of the best! Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Impressive black and white cinematography (which should have won an Oscar), a haunting Quincy Jones score and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly matched assassins. This movie was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and was not even nominated for Best Picture, while Dr. Doolittle was. Go figure! <br /> <br /> Although you do not know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and in the process of appeasing the pain of tracking down these guys below. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no defects in this. 10 of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake in second place. Highly recommended!
