My girlfriend and I have something for robots. So I try to find movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Big. They hit the roar and hit each other, with the fate of the nations in the balance. It's pretty cool. You have to forgive this film for its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his team of technicians could put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. It is very hard not to like this movie. For those big robots. They looked like Transformers and fought like professional wrestlers! He made my girlfriend smile. And that is enough for me. And a special mention must be made to veteran actor Paul Koslo: as the Russian maniac Villano, whether he is relentlessly trampling his helpless opponents after they have already surrendered or complain that his proximity to him in a bar has provoked his vodka. he knows "like blood" (a line he offers with a deliciously cheesy sub-Bela Lugosi accent) is clearly having a ball and the movie benefits greatly when it's on the screen. This is an ingenious little movie that deserves its cult reputation.
