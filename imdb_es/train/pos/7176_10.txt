Okay, you want to prove to someone how comfortable he is with his adolescence and the shameful and manic changes that are in it. Then, get your immediate reaction by watching this documentary about children who make relevant horror films in the suburbs of the 80s. More than any other film I have seen, the film is about the sexuality and ego charge of a way that is completely human, never boring and reddened by the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discolored by the world of frantic adults by fear. The peculiarity in youth is accredited for everything from madness to perversion. Little tycoon Darren Stien seems to be coming to a deeper understanding of his triumphs and doubts as the patriarch of the world of strict children. What you find in yourself and in others is not always beautiful, but it shows how you can improve and reconcile with age. What it does mean change without reflection. I love this movie.
