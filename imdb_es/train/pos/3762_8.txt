Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two San Dimas drugs that are sent on another trip of their lives, since someone from the future feels exactly the opposite of the way it was presented in the first film. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that your trip is "somewhere" between heaven and hell and ends up being both. When they meet Grim Reaper, they have the opportunity of a life after life to play with him and have the opportunity to return and prevent two evil robots from ruining the future they were supposed to have. In addition to the roles that have ... er ... perfected, they also play (and revive a couple of additional sales in the process) some classic games (I even have my original copy of Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason why I liked this movie more than the original is because it's about "how could it be" instead of "what it was". Without spoiling the movie, I can not give you more information about this (I guess you'll have to see them both and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
