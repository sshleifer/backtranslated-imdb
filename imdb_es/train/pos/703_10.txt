I rated it with ten just because it seems so impressive what a young man of eighteen can do with a video camera. It's not epic, but it's very attractive and I never got bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go to the countless bad movies that are broadcast en masse, then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know that I will line up at the local cinema for its first major release. Damn good job, and well worth the money. What a script! It may be low budget, but it exceeds half of the main photos I've seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen. Serious congratulations to her, I can not wait to see more.
