Has Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprint for the cinema of the first category. This is the best performance he has given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys or bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on people who think they are executing it. Pacino's performance is not only convincing, the eulogy at the funeral of the dead child is incredibly powerful, but the film has a sharp and harsh realism that enhances good performances without resorting to tricks. This excellent portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of excellent movie viewing without undue violence, overheated sex or boring language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they cross effectively without crossing the line. A movie like this restores my faith in Hollywood. I do not grant many tens. He deserves it richly!
