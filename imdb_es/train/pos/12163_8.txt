I found the film quite expressive, the way in which the main character was lost, but at the same time much clearer about certain things in life than the people who made fun of him (his roommate, for example). <br /> <br /> He was tortured and you loved seeing him tortured! He had a perverted side that was frightening, but we were all happy to see him come out of misery again. <br /> <br /> It was like a game character or bulldog through a mined land or the enemy and we love to see him attack or shoot a sniper, but in the end we are glad to see him survive ... <br /> <br />
