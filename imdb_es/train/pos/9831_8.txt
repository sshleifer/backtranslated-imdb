We have high expectations with this. . . Because it's Zombie 3, the official sequel to Zombie 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . but nevertheless . . . is co-directed by Bruno Mattei (from Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti, but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and filmed in the Phillimines as Night of Zombies and looks like Night of the Zombies (Hell of the living dead) a lot. as a result, it's more like a Hell of the Living Dead companion than Zombie 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis, who produced Zombie 2 and its editor Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi gave Zombie 2 its magic. . . Zombie 3 is not magic. . . It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But over the years, I've come to accept Zombie 3. I could swear I saw a version in which a soldier was bitten in the arm and went to the hotel room. . . there was a cut of Fulci without meaning and that of Mattei / Fulci is the one on DVD.
