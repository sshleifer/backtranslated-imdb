Fatal Error is a really great movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are in the film. The cast of the film acted very well. Robert Wagner played his good role. The relationship between Saboto Jr. and Turner was nice. Maybe there is a big age difference there, but they are a unique couple. The two actors really worked together pretty well. The music in the film is very good for Ron Ramin and fits very well in the movie. There are a lot of things that happen in the movie that you do not know what's going on and what will happen next, and this movie keeps you from start to finish. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr. and Janine Turner, watch this excellent movie!
