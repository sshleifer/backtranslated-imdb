Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It seems a story of loss, when in reality it is a story of being alone. Some people will never feel loneliness at this level. <br /> <br /> The character of Cheadles Johnson reflected the exact opposite of Sandler's character, Fineman. Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings, Fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada is a wonderful additive for the cast and Sandler takes out tears. Cheadle had the comic role and was a great defender of Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see the Oscars somewhere here. A very thin film. If you have ever lost and you have felt lonely, this movie will assure you that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
