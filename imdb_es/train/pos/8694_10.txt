It was in 1988, when I saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Austrian television). At that time, he was already a big fan of Spitting Image (since when he won the bronze rose of the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course I recorded all the shows on tape and saw it again and again, especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember that scene when Ronnie stood in front of a painting by Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and told himself "I need to shave." Or the funniest thing of all, when he played ball with his dog, but vice versa! <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Spitting Image seems to fall into oblivion; It was one of the most fantastic and intelligent television shows in history. Compared to other satirical transmissions, it was definitely the best of all. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been almost 20 years since then, and I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... somewhere?
