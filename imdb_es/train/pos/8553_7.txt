['I just saw the movie. I was afraid that I would be disappointed. Although I was quite surprised at the end. The American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all time. Yes, it will not be true if I say that I enjoyed it as much as the originals. The beta house along with the two previous cakes definitely lost something that the first two cakes had. It is not going to become a classic as the first two already did. but what the heck is still fun with many good times and I think it should be the first movie to choose if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. The beta house deserves 6/10, but I gave it 7/10 just for being another portion of PIE.']
