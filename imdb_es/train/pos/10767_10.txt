['Of course, I would have to give this movie 10 out of 10, since my uncle was the main screenwriter of Once upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego wrote scripts for more than 50 years living in Italy. He was a great storyteller and someone suggested that he write his stories. So did Rodolfo Sonego. If you check your biography, you can see how many movies have been made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor who starred in their stories. My uncle visited Australia and my city in 1968 to find places for &quot;A girl in Australia&quot; and created a great movie about a surrogate girlfriend after the Second World War. You can see his humor in all his films. I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently. COOL']
