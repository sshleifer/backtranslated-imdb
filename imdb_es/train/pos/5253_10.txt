I really do not understand why people get so angry and watch this movie! Remember, folks, this is a SNL movie, not everything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction! The Ladies Man is a hilarious film, although sometimes stupid, with a crazy cast and, as usual, wonderful performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are incredible, but it's a comedy! I really do not understand how someone could not laugh a lot during this hilarious movie. Anyway, all I ask is that people take this as it is: a SNL comedy, silly and irreverent. Nothing that will win prizes, but nonetheless, some modern golden comedy. "Apricot 10-4!"
