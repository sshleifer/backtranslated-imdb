I loved this program ... intelligent acting, intelligent dialogue, a great story with real people ... give it back or make it available online ... I really miss it ... I hope Davis really shines in this program. I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... It really makes sense in this insane world. Get rid of those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance. Please, bring it again. When it went out, I saw it online and I liked how I could see it with minimal interruptions, in fact, ABC online makes it easier to enjoy the programs when you miss them in prime time ... past are days of endless recordings. When you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
