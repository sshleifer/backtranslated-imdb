Although some criticisms were clearly warm with Luke, I found the story totally fascinating and even if some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boon', so what? It is good to see a warm and moving story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience sniffed and surreptitiously wiped their eyes. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert are passionate about each other, although, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. However, I felt that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, perhaps is also a pantomime villain. As it is rumored that he was, in fact, Victoria's real father (as a result of an affair with his mother, the Duchess of Kent), it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess, trapped in the suffocating palace with courtiers and politicians to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great queen of England, who thrived as never before, during her long reign. I believe that word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this movie looking more pleasant and wonderful.
