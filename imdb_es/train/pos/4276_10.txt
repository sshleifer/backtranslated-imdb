At first glance, Who's Singing Over There seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy? with only an unusual, silent and slow type of camera: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Starting with two singers in a desert landscape, then a bus and a wonderful group of actors, hide a jewel! <br /> <br /> Folded history, and a false rhythm makes you think, yes, it's comical, but it only lets you guess that it will be a smooth movie. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny for instantaneous, subtle dark cynic in others, its development surprises you throughout history. Very cleverly and ingeniously presented, all the characters are important, and the actors give them a full life. <br /> <br /> And what is surprising, is based on deep observation, the great mastery of camera work and has great significance. , and really everything, the general direction and how the details are also presented, which simply makes you forget that it's a movie: it's like seeing a kind human society, which you do not yet know, filmed by a friend behind a camera. . <br /> <br /> And you are the one behind it. It's simple, and just exceptional! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong; in no way that would mean that the script, the quality of the image, the musical score have a kind of amateur style, no, no! It is a great art! <br /> <br /> Why does it flow like a river? From the top of the mountain, to the sea, with all the different types of terrains and pilgrimages that a real river will face on its journey to the sea. From a small thing to a mainstream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image that I used is the best way I can find to explain all the charm that Who's Singing Over There has. For me, again, I take the hammer: simply exceptional ... <br /> <br /> I have seen that the Director is the one who made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know is quite famous. But since I had not seen him yet, I had no idea about this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers wrote dithyrambic comments about that movie, I totally agree. <br /> <br /> European Eastern Cinema is not well known because it rarely translates, but I am lucky to have this copy in its original language, with good subtitles in English. In general: deep, delicious and exceptional ... <br /> <br /> For the types of fast and empty explosions and special effects, avoid it at any cost, it can be too subtle and good for you! <Br /> <br /> But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, I suppose you will not regret this, and if you buy, you will have a good company in your personal DVD library, with nothing less. who deserved big names like Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry among some of my favorite directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** A movie is never really good unless the camera is an eye on the head of a poet Orson Welles ***
