First of all, I have to give it to the people who got this. September 11 is such a sensitive issue that making a film that dares to be controversial requires a lot of guts. It is a pity, although not surprising, that the film has been banned in the United States. <br /> <br /> That said, I think the movie is excellent with a couple of weak moments. The film begins with the Iranian segment that reminds something of the work of Majid Majidi (the "children of heaven" absolutely beautiful and "the color of paradise"). Like those 2 movies, the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of Afghan refugees in Iran. Absolutely beautiful clip. The same goes for the Sean Penn clip, which is also excellent. But just as some of the clips are beautiful, others are absolutely brutal. Alejandro Gonzales Iñárritu makes the Mexican clip and, like his heartbreaking "Amores perros", he does it as brutal as he can. Most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds in the background. Those sounds are from the reporters and their commotion when the second plane crashes, those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families, those who were angry ... and he combines this with the flashes of people who they jump from the towers. A clip that is very difficult to see and one that you will not forget. <br /> <br /> Some clips can be very difficult for Americans to see, since some of the clips can be interpreted as "you are not the only ones who are suffering". In particular, the Egyptian and British clips that not only say that but change the tables and say how much suffering the United States has caused to other people. <br /> <br /> I will also make a special mention of the clips from Bosnia-Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although the latter may seem terribly out of place, in fact it is not). <br /> <br /> However, not all clips are great and I make a special mention in the clip. of Israel which, in my opinion, is extremely weak. While the idea was good (a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, but his story is affected by what happened in New York and is something that many of us who live in countries at war we can relate). it's terrible. The video ends up being just an entertainment reporter trying to get some time on the air at all costs, a guy who says he is a witness and who hopes to be able to go on television, and that the soldiers and paramedics shout "just because." The clip does not capture the drama of such a situation. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see it, then you should, that is, unless you are conservative, in which case 'D better stay outside, as you might be offended. But if it is not, then you can know how many of us live until September 11.
