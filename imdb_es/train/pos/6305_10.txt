Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most charming movies I've ever seen. A gorgeous deal, tight editing and wonderful direction. A caper movie that does not get stuck in the standard tricks. <br /> <br /> You can not say much about this movie without spoiling it. The label line says it all - 5 guys. 1 safe. Without brains. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead an incredible cast. George Clooney must be congratulated for producing this gem. <br /> <br />
