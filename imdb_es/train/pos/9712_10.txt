Another criticism compared this company with a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also very aptly. Another review exposed the differences between the comedy we enjoy in a noncritical way and the black comedy, which is also worth considering. <br /> <br /> Look at the whole thing, the three series. In the end, all the characters are tied together and the pieces of the puzzle fit into place as well as a Douglas Adams novel. The details and complexities are amazing. Completely postmodern. Maliciously funny and surprisingly tragic. It is not for children. Not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity. Provocative of thought. At the same time, literal, figurative and surrealist in disturbing forms. The darkest comedy I can remember. <br /> <br /> And quite possibly the most wonderful thing I will ever see.
