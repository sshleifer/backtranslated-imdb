What are the odds that a "Siren" helium balloon will travel from Yuba City, Ca. (November 8, 1993) and land 4 days later, (November 12) at MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada? ? (Approximately 4000) miles). It's a good movie. It is based on a real story. This film helps not only children to cope with losses, but also older people. I hope everyone enjoys it !!! Rhonda
