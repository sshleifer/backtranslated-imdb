... this is a classic with so many great dialogues and scenes that nobody should miss. Good story, funny situations from rich to rags, Mel Brooks is not a bad track, maybe it's not perfect, but it's funny; D Do not pay attention to the qualification, it is BS. Look at it, then look at something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If you do, I do not think we can be friends XD At this point, I recommend the fourth season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" to all Brooks fans;) Vote 10 against the ignorant views of inchworms! I have to do 10 lines here to post a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P
