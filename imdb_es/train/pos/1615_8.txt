Wonderful romantic comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry a man with whom she feels comfortable (Danny Aiello) until she falls in love with her stubborn and angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is clear with many great lines, the performance is wonderful, the accents (I have been told) are perfect and the cinematography is beautiful. New York has never looked so good on the screen. A must see for Cher and Olympia Dukakis, both are fantastic and deserved the Oscars they won. A beautiful, funny movie. You must see it!
