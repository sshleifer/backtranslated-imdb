When I saw this movie for the first time, it was a long time ago on VHS-Video. I liked this movie, because it was fun and exciting. A few years ago I saw another movie called: * The Incredible Adventure of Andy Colby * In this film parts of * The Wizards of the Lost Kingdom * used were used. They called this film "KOR the conququerer". I started looking for the movie "KOR" for many years, because I wanted to see the whole movie, not just the parts that were used in the movie "Andy Colby". No store had this Kor movie to rent and no store knew this movie. Many years I saw my old VHS tapes that I had at home, and what a wonder ... I have had this film for many years, but the film had a different title, because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was glad to find this tape at home and this time I had much more time to see KOR the Conquerer again. The music is excellent during the hole movie, but the best part of the filming in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR is drunk walking through the green forest. The background music had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy, who played Simon in the movie. Both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.
