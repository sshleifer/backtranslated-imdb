The movie surprised me. Personally I had herd mainly buzzing. Well, finally, after owning the DVD for months, I did it in a sleepless night. While the film was dragging, the additional footage was used for the purpose of the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from the addition to the game would have been less realistic if some scenes had been left out. The best thing about the film is its consistency with the relationship. There was no emerging pop or characters threatening the relationship. That is, we usually see that the girl meets the boy by a surprising twist of fate, they leave, something we saw coming breaks them and then they are together again in the last five minutes of the film. But this movie did not follow that mold. In fact, we experienced the relationship and its failures, and although the characters had moments of love, they did not have dramatic breaks, they went to assemble and made a montage every 15 and then they reunited in love. I did not feel that the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romantic movies. The story was unique and true to reality, the way I felt that these people in the film were the most credible I've seen in a romantic movie of modern times. And it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and that in the current world series, so fate prevailed a bit there as well. It's not "My Fair Lady" but it's a happy and honest movie. I will simply say that I like it.
