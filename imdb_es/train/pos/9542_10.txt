Do not be fooled by the silly people in the title, this is a sweet trip! A true successor of Tetsuo the Iron Man and Ichi the Assassin, this gem begins with a bang and leaves the blood fat until the credits accumulate. It seems that the aliens are taking the bodies of the people and modifying them to turn them into war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their kind. The winner of the battle eats the loser alive. That's mainly for the plot, but who cares when the gore is so good? I have no idea how many slime cubes were used, but it is unpleasant to see. There is an interesting and effective use of stop-motion when takeovers are in progress, and loving care is lavished on all creatures and make-up effects. The CGI is a bit limited, but in reality that does not detract from the general quality, at least for me. This was really a funny and moving movie that deserves a lot of praise, and it really has earned its place in the Cult Classics stack. Find it and look, you will not be disappointed!
