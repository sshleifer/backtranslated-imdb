['Even though this movie put Davis on the map because of his brilliant and intense acting as the illiterate waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this film is strangely unsatisfactory to me in general. The acting is fine in most aspects. What I can not understand for my life is how or why Phillip, a sensitive and well-educated young man, would take the constant abuse that this vagabond constantly attacks him: his naive tolerance seems ridiculously incredible in certain aspects. Yes, I know he is a sensitive intellectual, introverted, with club legs. But Davis is such a poisonous witch that no one who cultivates her would tolerate her attitude or her actions and make her credible. Davis is amazing in his role: yes, he may overreach in his histrionics from time to time, but it&#39;s a vividly creative representation any way you look at it. Too bad she was not playing the moll of a gangster. His character would have been completely credible as a vagabond among low-life people!']
