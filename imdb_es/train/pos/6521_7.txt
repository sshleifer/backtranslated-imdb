['Taken in the context of the time it was made, it seemed like a worthwhile movie. While the details may be &#39;dramatized&#39;, the general story was a good introduction. Also, I discovered that seeing the actors I met was a real pleasure. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as an outcast coward? I leave you the rest of the star to see you. As for the secondary casting, this film (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many of the best actors of nice character, but a great recognition for the right hand of Andrew Jackson, Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with beautiful boats and a competent performance around the world, I recommend it for anyone who has a taste for the camp, or an eye for a double period piece, set in the dawn of America, and made in a period in which it is excellent. The names, and the best character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.']
