This tends to be belittled by many Kurosawa critics and fans, but I thought it was wonderful. It is an episodic study of multiple characters of the poorest of Tokyo, who live in a city literally made of garbage. Although it looks like an atomic bomb strike, the film has a kind of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound of the insane young man who drives an imaginary cart through the neighborhood. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories fascinating, but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car. When they do not look for food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build the house of their dreams. An exciting and beautiful movie.
