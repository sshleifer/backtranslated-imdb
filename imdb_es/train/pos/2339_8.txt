I love this program. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction programs, so if it looks like them, I did not realize. I like the quality of the storybook of cinematography. I even like the love story, although while I'm enjoying it I wonder how the hell that part of the story can really develop when you see that Ned can not touch Chuck or ... well, you know. I even like Chuck, I do not find her annoying at all, and I generally hate characters that are too sweet, nice and perfect. I even like the narrator's voice, even if it annoys one of my family members and shows some resemblance to some Walgreens commercials. I could explain the other things about Ned's problem and how the writers will deal with it in the future, but I prefer to look, wait and see what story the writers are weaving.
