The debut feature of Miss DeCarlo has everything writers can find, from the Franco-Prussian War to the Civil War in the United States, the great American West, San Francisco in its heyday, ballet, opera, vaudeville, bandits Stage coaches and a Chinese. trash. Just when you thought that the plot could not be more complicated, it does. It is magnificent, tongue out on the cheek. The character of DeCarlo (here called Anna Marie, NOT Salome, that's the role she dances) is loosely based on the career of the famous Lola Montez, who was the mistress of the King of Prussia and caused a revolution when she gave him the jewels of the crown. . She escaped to the American West. There is a city in Arizona called "Salomé, where she danced", based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced the role of Salomé there. Stagecoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who fall under his charms are not historically accurate, nor do I suppose he is the Chinese sage with a Scottish accent, but he is one of my favorite classics at the camp of all time and DeCarlo is incredibly beautiful in everything.
