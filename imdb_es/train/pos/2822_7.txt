The movie Torrent was the first and the last for Greta Garbo. It was his first film made in the United States at MGM, the only studio in the United States where he would work. It was also the last time that someone else received an invoice over her in the credits, being its protagonist Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the popular work of the Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibáñez Entre Naranjos. It is a couple of misfit lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who can not meet, mainly due to the machinations of the mother of Cortés, Marta Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mattox is an evil woman who has some fixed ideas about who her son should marry. Remember that this is Spain and that arranged marriages were still quite appropriate at that time. Mattox has in mind Gertrude Olmstead as his daughter-in-law, she is the offspring of Mack Swain, a man who became rich in pig farming. Swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the piglets before they become large and old pigs to be slaughtered. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibáñez had previous novels The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse and Blood and Sand previously Filmed with Rudolph Valentino at the head. It could have been interesting if Valentino had done this with Garbo, but he could have been beyond filming when this was done. In any case, one of the contenders for Valentino Ricardo Cortez is filled with the male protagonist. <br /> <br /> One reason why Valentino did not want this film is because clearly the main character is Garbo, unlike the other two works mentioned above. . When Cortz does it with great impatience, he is doing what Mattox and his "advisory" banker Tully Marshall tell him, he leaves Spain and goes to France, where he becomes a great opera star. And he leads a pretty scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When she returns to Spain and tries to rekindle things, Mattox is even more outraged. She has a political career in mind for her son. Cortez is now running for the Spanish Parliament, which is curiously called the Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a flood and a dam that breaks causing all kinds of havoc in the field. Cortez, in fact, challenges the Torrente in a rowing boat trying to rescue Garbo from danger. When they get together, they have a brutally frank discussion, the brutality that comes from Garbo. <br /> <br /> Special effects here, however primitive they may seem now, are quite remarkable for their time. They look very similar to the shots used in the 20th Century Fox movie, The Rains Came, which came out in 1939 and won an Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately for Torrent, it came out a year before Oscar made his debut. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to reveal any ending so you'll have to watch the movie to see if Cortez and Garbo come together. at the end. Garbo, with good reason, won excellent reviews for his performance and at a time when exaggerated gestures were the norm in the silent screen performance, he was very subtle in his role. So she would be the rest of her career, she had a remarkable face for close-ups. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo would continue to work much better than Torrent, this film is still an appropriate debut for her on The American Big Screen and holds up very well for today's audience.
