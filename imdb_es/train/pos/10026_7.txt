Without Kirsten Miller, this project should not have been completed. However, with the amazing beauty and talent that is Miss Miller, I would definitely recommend it. It seemed as if the other actors were just playing at their strong performance. Wagner's sad attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes did not stop him from entertaining himself. Most of my criticisms are related to the writing and the plot, the group of talents gathered did a heroic job of saving what should have been a disaster. The charismatic delivery and time of Miller were impeccable and credible. She plays that thin line between assertive and bossy, but never offensive, in fact, is the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen, but unfortunately I was lucky enough to rent it before it was lost.
