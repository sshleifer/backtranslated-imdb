Although we know how the story ends, this is an exciting movie that is played almost like a political thriller. During the calm before the storm, we know Hugo Chavez as a charismatic man, bigger than life, who has an unbreakable connection with the mestizos that make up 80% of the population, but who had previously been excluded from the political process and the oil wealth of Venezuela. He seems as devoted to them as they are to him. He travels through the country at an agitated pace, reaching the peasants, addressing large crowds, hugging and kissing ordinary people, accepting letters on pieces of paper and listening for requests for help. People are excited that one of their members has reached the highest office on earth. There is an electric feeling of hope and optimism that indicates that the change to improve is reaching the draining neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. The Castilian elite of pure blood, which is a small minority but previously controlled all wealth, is full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most hilarious funny moments of the film is when an image of Ann Coulter, at a meeting of residents in an exclusive gated community, complains about the mestizos, "they have no concept of struggle or sacrifice." Minutes later, a speaker tells the meeting that "be careful with your domestic servants, you could be supporters of Chávez." Duh! Of course they are. <br /> <br /> In a nightly interview with the film crew, Chávez reveals something of his soul when he tells his grandfather's story. He can be a sensitive and poetic person, although with a roguish, even clownish sense of humor (as we saw when he addressed the UN and called Bush the devil). <br /> <br /> Then the storm begins to accumulate. As the organizers of the coup demand a massive protest and cynically manipulate their supporters to change the route at the last minute and march in the presidential palace, knowing that he is surrounded by supporters of Chavez and that violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot falls into place when the snipers on the roofs begin firing on Chávez supporters, some of whom return fire. The local equivalent of Fox News shows this return fire and claims that Chávez supporters are massacring the protesters. Then, the camera goes back and reveals that there are no protesters, the street is empty! The protesters took a different route. Needless to say, the images of the empty street were edited by private television stations with anti-Chávez rage (which had been transmitting a constant barrage of propaganda that called Chavez mentally ill and sexually obsessed with Fidel Castro). Immediately after the coup, we see The ringleaders and their masters of media propaganda openly boast on television about how they had manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents alike. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers continue to be at the center of this chaos, a situation that changes rapidly as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. Chávez finally gives up to avoid the bloodshed, but refuses to resign and is taken to a coastal island where a plane waits to take him. Where? The United States? How can the remaining cabinet members avoid the arrest and defeat of this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-rich businessmen who are closely related to the Bush administration? Watch the movie and discover it! <br /> <br /> If your only knowledge of Hugo Chavez and Venezuela is from the American media, then you do not know anything. He is not a "tyrant not chosen" and he does not "rule by decree"; he is enormously popular, since he was elected and reelected several times with more than 60% of the votes (something that George Bush Junior has never achieved) and the devotion he inspires in the common Venezuelan people and ultimately is the reason why the blow fails. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The ability of the filmmakers is to be discreet and let the story unfold through the voices of Venezuelans at all levels, from the neighborhood to the presidential palace, the tumultuous scenes, the chaos and confusion from which emerges a coherent whole that is tense, fascinating. and in movement. Do not be surprised!
