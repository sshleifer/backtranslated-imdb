Mario is invited to the castle of the princess peach for cake. When Mario arrives, he discovers that Bowser has kidnapped her. Mario must save the day again. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can explore whatever he wants. He can simply wander, climb trees trying to find 1-UPS, find secrets in the levels and more. You can spend four hours on one level. There are no time limits. There are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star gates, in which you need a certain number of stars to enter. Once you enter these stargates, you must go through a stage and fight against Bowser at the end of the stage. To reach certain worlds, you need a number of stars to enter. You enter the world through a painting. There are so many things to do and so many hours of play, I do not see how anyone can dislike this game. It's great. This launch title is the game that assured the players that the N64 would have a good life. All the 3D platform games we know have something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the best games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It's hard to find used because nobody is selling this baby for $ 5 at the pawnshop. A perfect 10.
