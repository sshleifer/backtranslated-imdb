I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent. The film is diamond among the coals during this time. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaws. This movie should have made them stars. Shame in the studio for not putting everything they had behind this movie. It could easily have been a franchise. DVD release is a must and a worthy remake would revive this movie. Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it in the list, no matter how late you see it, look at it. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself another favor: read the book (the same title). It will leave you speechless. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think they have done it.
