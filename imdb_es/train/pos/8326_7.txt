While "I.Q." by Fred Schepisi It really does not have important qualities, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with the PhD candidate in Princeton mathematics, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and his friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. <br /> <br /> Obviously little of The film is historically accurate, but that is not the point. It does not pretend to be anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of the most famous Robbins movie of 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A film about Einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also on his political activism, namely, how he wrote a letter on behalf of Scottsboro Nine and went against nuclear weapons (he came to the point in that the FBI kept a file of it). <br /> <br /> So anyway, this is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
