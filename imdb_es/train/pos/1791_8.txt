This is not a deep film; most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "proven and true", but it was well acted and made some interesting points about what we might regret (our "mistakes" as the film calls them) as we look back on our lives . I had not read the book, so I did not know much more than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories of a long time ago that she has not really shared with anyone. Fortunately, they have a top-notch cast ... Meryl <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays young Lila, and then Meryl appears at the end of the movie as old Lila ... In addition to an amazing resemblance (duh!), the younger actress did a great job (perhaps not quite the caliber of her mother, but who is she?) Everyone else in this movie was fine, although I wish there was more than Glen Close and he thought Buddy's character was a bit too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more a girls movie than for boys, but a good one to watch with your mother or your daughter, and maybe start a dialogue. How difficult it is to really know a father as a "person"!
