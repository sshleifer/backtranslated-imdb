This show has come so far. At first ALL in the cast from Eric to Fez, all were new actors and actresses, new faces and just looked at what they had achieved. They stayed with the show and it was a success. It's one of the best shows ever made and it's probably the funniest comedy I've ever seen. It will be sad to see it end, but if they finish this program, I hope to God that the end of the series comes with one of the biggest hits that any season finale ever had. I do not care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Go swing, get one last hit. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they leave, let everyone know it will end, as in Friends, and that the end is huge. I say Donna and Eric get married. I say that Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again. I say something interesting happens between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for a long time, but, of course, it will not work for him. ONLY CLOSE THE BIG TIME GUYS SERIES! <br /> <br /> That show of the 70 will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you as friends. You're the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
