John Travolta, the biggest honkeytonk in the world, and a mechanical bull ... what more can you ask for! Yes, you probably will not have many surprises or deep meaning in this. However, I have always found it quite pleasant to see this romance redneck. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley's and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you could expect an unconditional partner to have. The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, bull riding and, of course, the necessary fights. It has a good soundtrack from 1980, with "Looking for love in all the wrong places", "The devil went down to Georgia" and "Hello Texas" by my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Get out your cowboy boots and have a skating boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (From 4)
