This is a really fun (and sexy) movie, which is not only silly but has a great performance. It's the kind of movie in which the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you're connected to everyone in the theater. I saw him at the Boston Film Festival, and I found myself often laughing out loud with everyone else, and also touched by some of the most serious parts of the movie. It's a unique movie about two doctors, and I do not want to reveal anything, but there are some powerful and very funny scenes, in addition, the dialogue is great. The character of Wood Harris has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also fun and sexy in their roles. If you have the opportunity to see it, go, you will not be disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves a prize.
