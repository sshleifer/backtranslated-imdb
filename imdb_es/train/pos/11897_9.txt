['This is a small horror movie that fans of independent films will really appreciate. He has good acting, a lot of blood and a decent plot. One will remember movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It is obvious that the budget was not so big, but the film really makes up for it with the atmosphere and the solid performances of the actors, which seems to be missing in many of the big budget movies with special effects of today. The film really moves forward and there is excellent direction and good camera work. There are no wasted scenes, so the length of the movie is a bit short. Also, it seems that the ending leaves an opening for a sequel, which would also be very interesting. So take some popcorn, turn off the lights and enjoy this one.']
