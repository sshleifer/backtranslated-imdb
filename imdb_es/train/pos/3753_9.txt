This short film that inspired the next feature film, Spatula Madness, is a hilarious piece that faces similar caricatures that give rise to multiple writers. The short film is starring Edward the spatula, who after being dismissed from his work, joins the fight against the spoons of evil. This premise allows a fun content near the beginning, but is barely present during the rest of the function. The 15-minute run time of this movie is absorbed by a strange comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately there is not much more under it. The frame that is configured does not really have time to show. But surely it follows its plot better than many high-budget Hollywood movies. It's worth watching this movie at least a few times. Take it for what it is and do not expect a deep story.
