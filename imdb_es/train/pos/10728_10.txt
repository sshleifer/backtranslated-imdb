The perfect space of the fantasy movie. A group of children accidentally climbs into space and has to go back down, but they do, sure. This would not be a family movie if everyone died. Then everything will be sad. You do not want Kate Capsaw, the protagonist, to offer a Golden Globe, but unfortunately, she and Lea Thompson did not win any. That stinks so much. I can not say enough, this movie is great, Lea Thompson-lord, a perfect girl for this movie. This movie is the best insurance. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overrated and the space camp was underestimated. It should have been the other way around <br /> <br /> excellent 10 / 10- 0r maybe 11/10. I'm not good at math
