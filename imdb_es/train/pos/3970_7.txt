This is a film that at first glance seems to be J. Edgar Hoover, who gives himself a pat on the back for fighting the Klansmen, chasing the Indian killers, hunting the famous mobsters of the 1930s, fighting against the Nazis in the United States and the South. America during the Second World War and the Communists in New York in the early fifties. Of course, in 1959 we did not know about Mr. Hoover's obsession with keeping secret files about honest Americans, bothering people like Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., but worst of all is his secret love story with his deputy director, Clyde Tolson (If you want to know more about that topic, I suggest watching the movie Citizen Cohn). Leaving aside Hoover, this story of a life in the FBI told by Jimmy Stewart is a decent but outdated movie. Vera Miles as your devoted wife is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. As much as Hoover controlled the production and always made sure that the FBI was seen without fail, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side, quite an achievement considering that Hoover was always looking over his shoulder. The background score is also nice. I have read recent articles online that suggest that this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the best movie stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show it a long time ago and I hope they show it again.
