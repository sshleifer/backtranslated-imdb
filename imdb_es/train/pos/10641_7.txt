This Dolph Lundgren vehicle is a fun backward action movie, it will not win any prizes and is not very original, but it offers the products you would want to see in a Dolph Lundgren movie. Our dolph man is a former soldier who is now a teacher in a high school in the inner city and when the terrorists take care of him, it is up to him to save the day. Surely the script is not going to win any Oscar, it's very fun and has a fair share to share. Dolph Lundgren gives a good performance, but it comes alive in the action scenes, and the rest of the cast are not the best actors, but they keep it well. In general, detention is a nice action movie, but you've seen it a million times.
