I saw this film at the International Palm Springs Festival in 2005 and from the 14 films I saw there I would rate it as number 4. The 900+ theater was full and in the end it received a standing ovation. This was Peter Falk's classic if you are a Falk fan and exhibited a lot of chemistry between the characters of Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The title of the movie seemed too long and strange for me. I'm surprised that this has not become a general release. This was much better than most of the trash thrown at you by the major studios. Maybe too adult in the sense that it was geared towards the baby boom and the senior public. Many people could relate to situations in this movie. This will probably enjoy a kind of rebirth within a few years, when people remember this movie and consider it as a kind of jewel. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and I would definitely recommend it.
