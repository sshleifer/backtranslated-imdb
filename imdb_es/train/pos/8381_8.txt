['I&#39;ve loved this movie since I was young! It&#39;s excellent. Although it may be too much for the average movie viewer if one can not interpret certain subtleties in the movie (for example, our hero is called Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander he is shot in the heel with a rocket, as well as Achilles in mythology he was shot in his heel). That&#39;s just a small fact that is fun! Anyway, great movie, good story, it would be great to see it remade with today&#39;s special effects! Interestingly, Gary Graham had an average success, starring in the television show Alien Nation. This movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!']
