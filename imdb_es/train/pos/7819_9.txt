What movie I never imagined that Richard Attenborough could have a movie like that in him. Gandhi has always left me indifferent, apart from the performance of Ben Kingsley, and I have never considered Attenborough a particularly good filmmaker. But Cry Freedom kept my interest like few movies in recent times. It is a fascinating and fascinating political film with excellent performances by Kevin Kline and a young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Kline plays Donald Woods, an editor of a South African newspaper who befriends civil rights activist Steve Biko. It begins as a difficult friendship, because Woods sees Biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites. But Biko, with his kind words, optimistic attitude and total transparency, beats Woods and presents him with a reality about Apartheid that Woods knew nothing about. <br /> <br /> Biko is a decent and law-abiding citizen who is altruistic. She opposes all prejudice and the system that holds her people back. One night, from an illegal meeting, she is arrested and beaten to death. The authorities try to silence the matter because Biko has become a great personality in South Africa. But through Woods' efforts, the truth comes to light. But what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare when Woods and his family become targets for the secret police. <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting structure. In fact, it has two narrations: first it narrates the life and the death of Biko. It's an amazing first half, completely dominated by the charisma of Washington in what may be your best performance so far. <br /> <br /> The second half, no less interesting, recounts Woods' attempt to escape from South Africa to publish a book. about Biko. Woods has become an enemy of the state, a forbidden person, which means he can not meet people or leave his country. He is also constantly spied by the police. Kevin Kline also offers a great performance in this second half. <br /> <br /> Although the first half is quite simple, the second half does interesting things with the edition, giving Biko flashbacks and events that show the repression against black South Africans. Some may argue that this is to make it more interesting, but for me the second half is just as captivating, as Woods and his family design a bold plan to escape from South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last minutes were so heartbreaking. I was in tears. The score of George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa certainly had something to do with that. Although I've never been very fond of Fenton (I can not stand his Gandhi score), I do believe that the Cry Freedom score is one of the most beautiful ever composed for film. The film, thanks to the music attached to the powerful images, sometimes reached incredible peaks of emotion. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch by Denzel Washington. This is a movie to be appreciated in its entirety. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit. This film deserves a place next to films like The Pianist, Life Is beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
