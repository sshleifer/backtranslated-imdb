Can I be so simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say "I liked it"? It's pretty funny in parts, it has great stars and it's great to look at. The songs (there are about two that are then repeated) are forgettable, but they receive a healthy ironic treatment (like the terribly handsome Mr. Fairbanks who explodes in the frantic Wagnerian version of the tender ballad that Miss Grable has just played); There is not much dancing with all the crinolines of 1861 around Miss Grable, and the comedy could be a little clumsy, but the result is still very stimulating. The photography (including the real outdoors shots that are exciting) is amazing, playing with different shades of heavy exuberant gold. Miss Grable is a little past her best and on the plump side, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental comedy "olde worlde". It is quite in the line of "Down to Earth" with Rita Hayworth, and that tends to be rather rejected by many. So I guess several people would consider "That Lady in Ermine" as obsolete and suffocating. But it's a fairy tale, and these tend to move in a certain paste anyway. My suggestion is: simply enjoy the work of art, the costumes, the ingenious script and everything that this film has to offer, and stop complaining. The film has been released on DVD in Germany, with a German and English soundtrack.
