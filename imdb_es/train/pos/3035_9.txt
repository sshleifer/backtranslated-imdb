['MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man ... General Douglas MacArthur. This is, of course, the story of one of the great military figures of the United States, and a figure that was familiar to me from the first moments of my memory. Although there is a continuity problem (there may be others), for example, MacArthur&#39;s speech depicted in the film as his 1962 speech to the United States Military Academy about accepting the Thayer award did not contain the phrase &quot;the old soldiers they never die, they simply vanish. &quot; (That was in his speech to Congress after his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two did not meet face to face!) Gregory Peck is impotent as the general who swore he would return to the Philippines In the Second World War. The film moves quickly and easily with the General, his family and his staff from the beginning of World War II until the end of his service career. This film would be of much greater significance to someone familiar with World War II and the Korean War. However, Peck&#39;s description of this great man who fought against the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can be memorable. &quot;In war there is no substitute for victory.&quot;']
