It's not a bad martial arts movie. The fight scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without dirty language and too much blood Scriptwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line with the story that works. It would be great to see more of her in the same genre. She likes art and having strong promenant women. It was definitely worth seeing. I recommend the film to all lovers of drama and martial arts.
