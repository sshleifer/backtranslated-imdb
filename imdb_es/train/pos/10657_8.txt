Jeopardy has the feeling of being a film of values, one of the films that the studios took out among the big budget / box office. It's only 70 minutes and he does not have many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a tough lady once again when she meets a fugitive convict while seeking help for her husband trapped in the Mexican desert. The majority of the film is focused on how he treats his captor, who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help. Some psychological battles there. <br /> <br /> It's a surprisingly effective little movie, its short duration makes it tense, and that Stanwyck is great should go by without mentioning (but I'll still praise her).
