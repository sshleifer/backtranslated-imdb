After watching the WW1 spy thriller, rather careless, Madam Lili (1969) starring Julie Andrews on TV this afternoon, I suddenly thought I had seen a much higher WW1 spy thriller. All I could remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It only took a short search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. Once I recognized the title, the memories came back flooded. It is, by its time, a reasonably well-crafted story that revolves around real events such as Kitchener's death and the German offensives of 1918. He also has a spy who is much more credible than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, the first and strongest memory was of the well-produced battle scenes and of men and horses with gas masks. If you have an interest in war movies and particularly in World War I, it is a movie that is worth seeing if you have the chance.
