In my opinion, this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it had been 10 years earlier. I doubt he will benefit from modern technologies, but he would look much better if they had lasted at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> The artists and animated did a great job. In my opinion, this film can present the best artistic background and one of the best character designs. The animations are extremely smooth and realistic. During the duration of the movie, you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a great job. It can also boast of being one of the sexiest animated female characters, if not the sexiest, who drinks easily with the typical anime girls. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are a couple of bad things about this movie that will make it not so. So attractive at this time. First, the plot and the execution are comparable to contemporary adventure films, and are very outmoded by modern standards. Second, due to the duration, it would benefit a lot with 20 additional minutes of dialogues. Finally, the scenario is not so popular at this time. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a great alternative to another short story about Conan the Barbarian, but not a novel.
