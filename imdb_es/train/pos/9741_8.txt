I was pleasantly surprised to discover that How to Lose Friends and Alienate People was not such a 'disgusting' comedy as the trailer had made me wait. I quickly became absorbed in the development of the narrative and remained absorbed at all times. The rhythm of the most visual humorous content was, I thought, successful. (I mean I have the impression that I witnessed Pegg's attempts to restore largely lost control 'in real time', so to speak). At other times, time was allowed to share the reflection of the main protagonists (ie, Pegg and Dunst). how the events were affecting them and what had brought them to where they were now. All the characters were well chosen, to some extent interesting in themselves and, in general, quite pleasant. (Any seemingly ruthless ambition shown tended to be moderated by a corresponding resistance capability). An entertaining film, with intelligent script, brilliantly directed and superbly represented that I would recommend widely.
