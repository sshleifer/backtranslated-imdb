Just a comment on the accents of New Orleans ... <br /> <br /> A previous critic observed the following: "This movie could have been filmed in New York or in another big city in the north because it presents us with characters that speak more as "broklynese" that maybe a southern accent that can be heard in that part of the country. " There was also another comment in this regard from an English critic. <br /> <br /> Many people in New Orleans, in fact, sound "broklynese". I have never discovered why. (It is mentioned in "A Confederacy of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole). I always appreciate the films that are made in New Orleans that include this detail, as it did. Very often it's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent.
