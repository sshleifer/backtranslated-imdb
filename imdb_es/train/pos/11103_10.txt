"The Godfather" of the television, but aside from his acclaimed and mafioso characters, the two do not resemble each other. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families: in one family, he is a loving father, but not as perfect as a husband, and in the other family, he is an intelligent and ruthless buyer. After the analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems actually stem from his mother Livia, who is suspected of having a borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character; however, Bracco and Marchand are not as well known for their equally talented performance as the psychiatrist and the mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and he's quite convincing and hooked. Chianese, the only recurring actor who actually appeared in a Godfather movie, plays Tony's uncle and his nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed the characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "fine" but not remarkable (with the exception of Iler's impressive performance in the third episode, "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are not convincing and exaggerated, but the show is too strong for them to retain it. Even though the program continues for more than six seasons, it stops having a boring or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (of four)
