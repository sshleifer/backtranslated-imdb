'What I like about you' is definitely a show that I could not wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show: "The Amanda Show". She is a very funny person and seems to be realistic. "Holly" is a person as similar as she is capable and has a personality "out of place". I enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around, so sometimes it got ruined. But that's what made the show so fantastic. <br /> <br /> I especially loved the show when the character 'Vince' appeared. Nick Zano is very HOT and funny, just like 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was great, each character had its own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting. I especially loved 'Lauren'; She is the best! She helped make the show more fun and you never know what she is going to do or say next. In general, the show is really good, but the reason why I did not give it a 10 was because there are no new episodes and because the episodes could have been longer and deeper.
