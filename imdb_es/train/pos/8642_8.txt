A surprisingly effective thriller, this one. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a successful and professional couple, he a writer, she a photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California and, in an act of compromise, Mulder accepts the decision on the condition that, on the way, visit sites of historical interest in relation to the famous serial killers. Her idea: he writes the words, she takes the pictures, and the end result is a great-selling coffee table book that will give them life. To help finance the trip, they decide to share the car and announce the fact. As bad luck has it, Brad Pitt sees the ad and, shortly after killing his landlord, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, meet the couple of writers and begin their journey through the countryside. Inevitably, mischief occurs. <br /> <br /> Pitt is outstanding as a genuinely inspiring Early Grayce and is backed by Lewis who plays his usual white garbage character, which seems to be his default setting. Duchovny and Forbes also do a convincing double act and, as the events get out of control, you, as a spectator, are absorbed by their situation and can feel the tension. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, sinister and beautifully photographed. This deserves recognition beyond its current status. One of the best movies.
