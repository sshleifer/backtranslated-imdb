I'll give it to you directly ... this movie is amazing. Foreign gay movies are fast overtaking American gay movies as production, acting and history. While so many indie gay films from the United States are grainy, bad sound, amateur acting, trite stories and a surprising lack of nudity or eroticism, high quality foreign gay movies have appeared like this one from France. The cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful, meaningful. The story is adult and complex (but it is not difficult to follow for anyone), the performance is intense and professional. Both tracks are fantastic, as is the entire cast. the boys are more than attractive and there is a lot of frontal nudity. You follow these guys all year, from their meeting to the end. All the little nuances of a relationship, the details of falling in and out of love are there beautifully realized. It left me wanting more. Check it out!
