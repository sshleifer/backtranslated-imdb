This is an entertaining look at the Gospel presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course) who sings a lot and also narrates a bit. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is quite nice. Also keep in mind the blonde representation of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blonde hair ... Anyway, it's a fun presentation of the biggest and most important story of all.
