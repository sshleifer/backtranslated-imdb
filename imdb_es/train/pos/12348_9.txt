It helps enormously if one is familiar with the culture and the period of time in which this film takes place. In the first place, these women are NOT geishas, ​​they are oiran (prostitutes) in the Yoshiwara type "green houses", around 1860, more or less ... This should help to clarify some details that may confuse those who do not they know. The film deals with themes of loyalty, love and, perhaps most importantly, how people face adversity, both their own and that of others in their immediate environment. That, in addition to the scandalous photography along with the beautifully fascinating music, makes for a lovely journey. Just plug it in, suspend your disbelief and enter your world. You will not be disappointed.
