There are some spectacular photographs, incredibly beautiful, of a variety of landscapes and animals, from the arctic to the tropical and everything that is in between. The techniques of the camera are varied and are located from close-ups to aerial work. The editing is tremendous and the commentary is also accurate, with the right tone and some dramatic and revealing facts about our world. Where the film falls a bit is trying to cover and integrate four themes: seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal histories and hunter / hunter interactions in multiple environments. Eventually everything becomes a little bitty and disconnected. In general, it's worth seeing, especially considering the topics covered, but do not expect Oscar material.
