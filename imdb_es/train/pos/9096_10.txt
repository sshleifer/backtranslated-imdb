Lovely! I saw National Import in Philadelphia in October with my children. We all liked it so much that we saw it for the second time with my parents. I have not heard them laugh like that in years! It was the first time I remember seeing a movie that my parents and my children could enjoy. It's really nice and we can not wait for it to come out on DVD. They need to make more movies like Domestic Import. It's refreshing to go see a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and not be ashamed). I have not seen such a nice movie since My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as the mother. She was also at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in this and it's very funny. I remember it from WKRP.
