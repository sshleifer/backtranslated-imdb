At two and a quarter hours, this is a reflective film, sometimes slow, interrupted by vast battles of swords. The battle between darkness and light is represented by the constant motive of the blazing sun and is magnificently demonstrated by a three-way fight between "demons", bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse. <br /> <br /> Get ready: after an impressive sword fight under the skies filled with lightning, at the end of this image you will have to scratch your head with puzzlement.
