A deplorable social condition triggers the catastrophe: an impoverished Giovanna has ended up in the gutter, but she still has an ace up her sleeve: beauty and youth. Bragana, a fat-belly gas station tenant who has been working for years, picks her up from the street and offers her her bed and home along with her clumsy affection. But the physical contact that Giovanna is now exposed to only causes her disgust, so she does not see a benefactor in him, but a torturer from whom she has to get rid. <br /> <br /> The arrival of Gino, a young migrant worker, finally gives him the desired opportunity. And she does not have to ask twice: in the first encounter, she gives him the sensation of being physically desired, and a little later allows him to seduce her without offering any resistance. <br /> <br /> The development However, the association must submit to the strict rules developed by Giovanna. Gino's desire for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave the place with Giovanna and start a new life away from the fat is left aside. Giovanna points to another objective: kill Bragana, inherit and, in addition to that, collect the insurance premium. In his hands, Gino degenerates into a sacrificial tool. Being completely at the mercy of this woman, he becomes a cold-blooded killer. <br /> <br /> But unlike Giovanna, she questions the crime committed morally. The fact of taking the place of Bragana, which includes sleeping in a dead man's bed, provokes a deep hatred towards himself. And later, after she has learned of the next payment of insurance money and seems to see through Giovanna's cleverly contrived plan, she also executes a physical separation from her lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute. <br /> <If the Visconti film ends at this point, it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a fresh, calculating, unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism. But then the latest sequences cause this carefully constructed construction of ideas to collapse. At last, Giovanna feels remorse for what she has done, and by the intransigent revelation of her most intimate feelings, manages to inflame Gino's love again. His violent death by an absurd traffic accident not only leaves him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate. It also affects us, although we realize that none of the characters that act should be responsible for their disaster. The culprit is simply the state of a society that determines the path of the individual unalterably from the beginning. <br /> <br />
