I just came back from a screening a couple of hours ago, and I was very happy with the movie when I left it. It's very intense, and the closest I've been to crying in a movie in quite some time. That is a credit to Adam Sandler, who offers a magnificent performance on many levels, and who probably deserves an Oscar for it, if he did not leave so early in the year. Don Cheadle offers his excellent habitual performance interpreting the heterosexual man before the perturbed ones of Adam. <br /> <br /> There is some humor, but most of them are really fun compared to the moments of tears, since Adam deals with his loss and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays two levels very well ... when he is mentally stable, it is fun and enjoyable, but when he is, well, less stable is powerful and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it for anyone who likes it intensely. Mental dramas about the difficult friendship and loss.
