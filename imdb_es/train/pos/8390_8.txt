My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. The cinema and the alternative cinema (small room, with uncomfortable seats, the public had to wait while the film rolls were changed) were a perfect combination. <br /> <br /> Many cliches were used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really funny. The sound was also brilliant (sometimes, going back higher than the dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I loved the way he introduced himself after the war. Very funny! <br /> <br />
