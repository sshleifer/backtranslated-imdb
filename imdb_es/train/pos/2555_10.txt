The movie was not that great. The book is better But the movie was not that bad either. It was interesting to say the least. The plot had enough suspense to continue watching me, although I would not say I was really interested in the movie. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are handsome enough to keep watching :) They have some pretty scenes that should attract the romantics. In general, I would give a 7 or 8 to the movie. It was not bad, just a little missing plot.
