My daughter really bothers me when I refer to Drew Barrymore who looks like she's been hit in the face with a frying pan, not to mention her Dudley Dooright chin that Jay Leno would die for. How wonderful, then, when I discovered in "Fever Pitch" that I really like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This movie is probably best characterized as a sweet and light comedy. To be absolutely stereotyped, the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and the vulnerability of Jimmy Fallon, and the kids will like it for all the masculine ties and the representation of sports mania. <br /> <br /> My hatred for sports wife, my teenage daughter, and we all found something that I liked in the movie. That says something in itself. It's a nice way to spend an hour and a half more or less, and probably also a good date for the appointment.
