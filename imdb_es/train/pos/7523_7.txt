I watched this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it's a movie and not a movie, as it was apparently filmed by HBO to be shown on its cable network sometime this year. This film features Page as a bondage and fetish fetish actress and a bachelor party actress who had enough talent to become a true actress. Page was a little more than that and the film touches some of its other roles in modeling, but not enough to balance the career of the pinup icon of the 50s. This movie is supposedly based on the book "The Real Bettie Page "by Richard Foster. It is shot in black and white by the feeling of nostalgia of the fifties. I have the book called "The life of a legend of Pinup Bettie Page" that has many great pictures that relate the career of Page and I must say that this film is reproduced in the film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of the famous photos. precisely. The same Mol with the black wig and brown contact lenses of Bettie Page is Bettie Page. Not only does she look like Bettie Page, she also has the smile and characteristics of her personality that were reflected in the perfect camera. And his body is as close as possible to a replica of Page. Fantastic casting. The story is a bit thin and tabloid and it certainly could have been much better. But this is a very good movie for television. I would rate it with a 7.0 of a scale of 10 and I would recommend that it be seen when it comes out on TV.
