I swear, that zombie was killed like twice, and kept coming back. I gave this film a 8. Let's face it, this is exactly what the other critics say, that is, a "camera", filmed. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to the full realization of indy movies. The fact that Todd Sheets has made more than 700 zombies appear in this film is a tribute to his talents. Yes, history has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies over and over again, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a fun and bloody horror movie, one to share with your friends, or to make fun of the people that really interest you in LOL. Gentle people, I guess everyone liked bits of trash like "Titanic" or "Twister" instead. Peace, and support for the realization of independent films !!!
