They come out of the left field, and REALLY is not what you're waiting for. But I love that. The most memorable experiences of the movie come from surprise, if you ask me. If you have not been told about the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange ... a surprise awaits you. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic, but it does not stretch so much that it's palpable The special effects come out of nowhere (seriously, it's like a strangely dark romantic comedy until they do it, then WOW) and they're great . The general cinematography is easy for the eyes, the editing and the sound are of very good quality, and the twisted history develops without clich√©s. While none of these aspects makes it a blockbuster, "what the hell?" ALONE factor makes it a cinematic treasure. <br /> <br /> The people who hit this movie do not make sense. It's one of those often overlooked movies of the 90s you've never heard of, or you love it so much that it startles you by mentioning its title. <br /> <br /> I'm in the last group.
