Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once throughout the film did I find myself looking into space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the movie, although I think someone with more glamor or enthusiasm would have been better, but she did a great job. All the supporting actors were also very good and helped the film. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this movie THE HISTORY is great, and very realistic, it does not move around the bush, it is very direct when sending your message. I think more movies should be made like this, I'm tired of seeing the same candy movies over and over again, now they're hard to digest. Everyone should see page 3, it's a great movie. -Only my 2 cents :)
