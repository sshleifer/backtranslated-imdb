On the day of the great study system, the most difficult casting decisions were made. All the old people, all the Americans, James Stewart appear as Hungarians in The Shop Around the Corner. If he had been filming the movie, Kralik's part would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart had some of the same problems in Mortal Storm, also with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was her most frequent protagonist on the screen, she made four films with her. But it is only this one where none of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward met Stewart when he was a troubled player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend, Henry Fonda, back then. <br /> <br /> I think that only Clark Gable could be an American in a non-American cast in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were also American, so nothing stood out. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart, then you will see a good film by Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is quite simple, a man and a woman who work in a department store in Budapest do not get along in person. But it seems that they are carrying out a correspondence with some anonymous admirers who happen to be one another. The employer, Frank Morgan, also suspects that Stewart has made a mistake in talking to his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the tracks are fine and Frank Morgan is separated from his usual confused person, the two players that best come out are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when it takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. It becomes very scarce. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is great as the little officious worm who constantly kisses Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I've met many like Schildkraut in real life who are in the office politics 24 hours a day. Sad that pays a lot of time.
