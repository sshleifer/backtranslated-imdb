I always said that animated Batman movies were much better than live action movies. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the animated films, but anyway, this is the poorest, and it is quite disappointing. . <br /> <br /> "Mask of the Phantasm" will be classified as the best, then "World's Finest", then "Sub Zero", then "Return of the Joker", and finally this will be in last place. <br /> <br /> In this new animated film, there is a new and mysterious batgirl in Gotham and Batman intends to discover if she is friend or foe when the search for revenge begins. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce becomes involved with three young women, he begins to investigate them and discovers who the new batgirl is. <br /> <br /> The tone in this film is unusually light, considering that most of the films are somber and gloomy, which was quite disappointing. Bruce acts strangely out of place most of the time, the villains are reused from the latest movies and, while the action scenes are exciting, they are really nothing new. It also lacks the dramatic impact that the other films have, especially that of "Sub-Zero", which had a great dramatic development and characters. <br /> <br /> Everything in the film feels pretty recycled and the secondary characters are charming, but nobody is worth to bet on it. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I really enjoyed this, had a great time, and the identity of the new batgirl is amazing, but this was not as exciting as I 'd expected. <br /> <br /> (** half of ****)
