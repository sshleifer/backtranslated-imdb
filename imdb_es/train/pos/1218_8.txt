This caricature was strange, but the story actually had something more depth and emotion than other cartoon movies. We have a girl in a camp with low self-esteem and hardly any other friend, except a brother and sister who are as miserable as she is. It reaches the lowest point and, when the opportunity arises, it literally makes a pact with a demon like the devil. I discovered that this film is very true to life and when things can not be worse, the girl sees what she has done, feels remorse and then changes, and then helps this mystical and dark creature to learn the human quality of love. The twins also get better, helping the small bears and then they also get a sense of self-worth. A very positive message for the children, although some elements of the film were strange, it was and still is a very nice movie. The music of Stephen Bishop (songs by Tootsie) made the film even better.
