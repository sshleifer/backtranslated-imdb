This is truly one of the best movies about love I've seen. Very often by nothing less than "Before Sunset", which technically is not another film, since it is about the same two people and the same romance. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. Ok, that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the protagonists of the movie. As I read the other reviews, I am pleased to know how many other people are crazy about the films based on dialogue as well. And this is what makes "Before Sunrise" so good. The dialogue is perfect. It is so real, so attractive and fun. It's not a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, because you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one in the cafeteria, where they try to make a phone call. His best friends, with the other pretending to be said best friend. It is perfect. It returns you to the moment you fell in love for the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I must say that if you have a choice, look at "Before Sunrise" before seeing "Before Sunset". If, like me, you saw "Sunset" first, it's hard to get rid of the grief and sadness of the two young lovers throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Once again, the best romantic movie in my books. . Wonderful performance, excellent script, and beautiful places. Young love, at its best.
