Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty. He was harassed, and picked up in high school. A group of children made several jokes, and these jokes were REALLY bad. The last joke ended tragically. <br /> <br /> cue to 5 years later. The gang of children meets again for a meeting. One of them installed him in the old high school. The school is now abandoned and they have to break in. For some reason, the Concierge is still there, but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start partying, and looking at their old lockers, and they see something from Marty. A girl feels sorry for Marty, but another boy calms her down. <br /> <br /> Once the deaths begin, it's great. Each death is creative and bloody. We see a figure in a jester mask, hunting them one by one throughout the school. It seems that Marty has returned to take revenge. After they kill the first person, they discover that they are locked up in school. They start looking for an exit. <br /> <br /> Now, there are a number of illogical things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a 5-year meeting. Second, after the first child dies, a girl receives blood on her. They all flee in panic, but she runs to the bathroom and finds a bathtub. Your friend has just been murdered, and she decides to take a bath? More importantly, why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom? Anyway, the bathtub does not seem to really work ... and she dies of a horrible death, this is a movie from the 80's. It's a horror slasher. WHO CARES YOU if you have some illogical parts? I, for my part, no. This movie has really big deaths. The end ... there is a turn. Having recently seen Haute Tension, I can compare the two. The only way they are similar is that there is a turn, which left me disappointed ... THEN, right after the turn, there comes a big, if not the best death, in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the last murder, the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy, and it was the perfect way to finish the movie. It has me going "wow ..."
