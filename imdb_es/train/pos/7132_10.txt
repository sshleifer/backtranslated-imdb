A moving movie. The usual excellent performance of John Thaw, who passed away recently. A man who was always so simple. He was one of the 10 best actors of England of my time. <br /> <br /> He can be remembered for his famous role as Inspector Morse. Like Jack Regan in the 70's Sweeney television series and as a lawyer in Kavanah QC. A must for the whole family and a great DVD for my collection. The shooting will bring some memories for people who remember Britain in times of war and certainly those who were evacuated from London to escape the German attacks. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and the boy William performed very well and were faithful to Michelle Magorian's book.
