This is simply one of the best versions of Dicken's classic tale. The script follows very accurately the story originally written by Dickens, and captures a perfect balance between a movie atmosphere and a game atmosphere. Spectators interested in any of the formats will find enough history rooted in the style of presentation of their choice. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of Scrooge, and is very convincing in character development. Instigated by the visits of the ghosts. I discovered that he was able to earn me to the point where he sympathized with the old miser, something that is rarely done in other versions. The excellent work done by the supporting actors contributes enormously to this production, which is simply the funniest of all the versions of Christmas Carol that I have seen.
