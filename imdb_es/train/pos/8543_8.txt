This was one of those movies that I probably would never have chosen, but one day I came to the IFC and I said: Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I had changed the channel, I would have really lost a treasure. <br /> <br /> The issue is depressing: a young author paralyzed in a climbing accident convalesces in a low-class rehabilitation center. It would have been so easy and tempting to make this a tear manipulator. But, that does not happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez, after he himself was accidentally paralyzed. There is no Hollywood happiness here. All the patients in the room come from very different backgrounds, but share a feeling of helplessness, of being at the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a kind of "lone wolf", forced into a shameful dependence on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is fine as a former man of ladies whose family is falling apart; but William Forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay to take away his independence. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
