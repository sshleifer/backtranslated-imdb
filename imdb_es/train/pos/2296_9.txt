_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be, but an impressive tribute to Actors French and its cinema. <br /> <br /> Backed by a solid reflection on cinema and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film in which most of the famous actors they play their own role (not to mix with living their life in front of the camera, the film is not a voyeur) is rather vague and follows the actors in a series of episodes that make the film quite funny. When Andr√© Dussolier leaves the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play her role (great actress, it is hilariously serious, especially when, in the role of Dussolier, she complained about herself), when the actors run to each other in the street, asking for autographs and fighting. and gossip happens, we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each (or others) have played. <br /> <br /> Actually, for those who do not know the actors (most of them are at least 50 years old) or I do not know French cinema, this movie has less interest, since most of the references will be lost , but still offer a good track of reflection on aging, acting, public life ...
