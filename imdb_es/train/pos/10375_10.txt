An Australian field rules player (Mat) goes to town the night before a major AFL test match, where he will be picked up by his cousin. And then things go wrong. <br /> <br /> His non-worker cousin has been mixed up in a drug business that involves the local moneylender / drug dealer Tiny (who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitely Australian). It goes without saying that Mat is entangled in chaos, and it is not long before the thoughts of tomorrow's game deviate from his mind as the frantic events of the night unravel. <br /> <br /> Professional Shakespeare from Western Australia. Actor Toby Malone plays a country girl, Mat, and successfully plays a role well below her age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny, and an entertaining role as David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops who follow the events. The roll is fast, often fun, and a very valuable one hour use.
