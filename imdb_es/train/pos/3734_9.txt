The dehumanizing effect of war is a subject that has been studied in movies; as well as the dehumanizing, equally dehumanizing, but life-saving, dehumanizing effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated as garbage but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and reserve judgment on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified ; as is the trial of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting vision, by focusing his account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played by Colin Farrell in an outstanding way), who understands that all power ultimately governs by consent and lack of awareness among the powerless in his own complicity. . Around this character, a captivating and captivating plot has been built, and it is also an advantage that the action never leaves the United States (while Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just another movie of a similar type, lost the focus once the action changed to Asia). While this is not a film of amazing originality, it is very well made and it is a captivating visualization: the best film of this director that I have seen, and among the best of its kind.
