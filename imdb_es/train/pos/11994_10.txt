As for many here, I can not stop praising the cast and team that developed Talespin and others that they did throughout My Childhood. I, like all those who commented here, have enjoyed the quality not only of the animation but also the quality of the story. The lines and the characters. <br /> <br /> To classify this work of art as a "caricature" I could never do Talespin Justice. In fact, it is an insult to classify it as a "caricature". Talespin is an animation and nothing. less, it is evident that it is the greatest work of genius that has been produced in Disney to date. When Disney "extracted" it from the air, they did not realize what they did and I am sure that their souls have been tortured by repentance since then. br /> <br /> I'll take a moment to explain, from the first one that is ducktales to the last one I think is Darkwing Duck, Disney has been plagued by flaws due to political correctness and has taken a quantum leap backwards from, They prefer Quantity over Quality now, not to mention Monkey's full room for the story, I could not make My children see the numbing "Comics" they throw now for fear that they all turn into a Simpson homer sometime in the future and 50% of the blame would be on me for allowing them to see it, I could not let that happen, so I have ALL the programs of the late 80's in the mid 90's on a hard drive so that one day My children can not be corrupted by today's "Cartoon Hunt" and to savor the last part of my childhood and to hold on, I owe it to Talespin. <br /> <br /> To me, Talespin is undoubtedly the best animation ever produced in the world because of it's depth, charm, wit, compassion, emotion and lack of really bad quality and the story lines that many have today. Do you see any of that content in "Ed, Edd and Eddie or anything else you can imagine?" the garbage produced today can be compared to the indecipherable Hyroglyph that represents a Picasso of 3 years. <br /> <br /> The next time you see an episode of Talespin; take a look at the wood grain in any wooden object or building such as Higher for Hire and get away from the quality of the workmanship and the effort put into this Animation, even the backgrounds of a shot were made as if they were used one and Again, The Buildings looks faithful to the Art Deco movement that was popular in the period of time described, even the vehicles are true to life, it's okay, not all the episodes were fantastic in the animation, but the scenes of higher quality were covered by the higher scenes, so overall it matched everything at the end of the episode and you probably would never notice it unless you were focused and paid attention to the details. <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about this is what I like to call "Deliberate errors" or "Intentional errors" in each episode and some have two. For example, in sheepskin, where Rebecca says "You're ready for something Baloo" and Baloo responds "Who, me! As innocent as a schoolboy" look into Rebecca's eyes, I won "spoil the rest of the Baloopers but stay Attentive next time. <br /> <br /> All the comments of others are accurate and 100% correct, I have nothing more to add that others have not already said here Disney, get up and smell the coffee. Asleep for more than a decade, stop producing garbage and return the quality to the animations and stop producing "cartoons." We have seen the proof of what you can do and we want to recover it as quickly as possible
