I thought that this movie was pretty good. Some parts were corny, but that's understandable, since it was made more than 55 years ago. I thought that the best performance in the film was given by Michele Morgan, who played Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also very good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good at this movie. If you have a craving for a silly and exaggerated musical comedy, Higher and Higher is the movie for you. <br /> <br />
