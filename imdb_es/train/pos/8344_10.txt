This is one of my favorites of all time. It's so simple and sweet - definitely a romantic girl movie comedy. I really like a movie full of good dates and this has it ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters "Are you thinking about what I'm thinking" and Ed says "Now, what are the odds What happens? In my opinion, a movie is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and enjoy the same amount of fun, and with this, you can do it! I also liked the way Walter M. portrays Einstein. I think all the characters fit very well and the story flows very well. There are so many times that I find myself smiling along with the movie and quoting my favorite phrases while I watch it! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a romantic comedy to feel good from time to time.
