After several extremely good grades to the point of SUPERB, I was extremely satisfied with the film. The film was dark, moving, anger, pain, guilt and an extremely convincing demon. <br /> <br /> Initially I had expected to see many special effects, and like the caress of a lover, I was surprised. With the subtlety and the rectitude of it. Brian, again I am impressed with your art with the storytelling and your special effects care. You're going to go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, the award for best actor, was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> In general, the performance, the story line, the high quality footage and the impressive effects, was fantastic. I wish it was longer. I look forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
