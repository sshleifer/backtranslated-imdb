This movie is light, funny and beautifully filmed. The beam is absolutely magnificent, and the colors convincingly recall Vermeer's paintings. <br /> <br /> This is a sentimental comedy in all its splendor, well above American and French standards, and possibly better than the English. <br /> <br /> Each character is playing, and the performance is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is splendid, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series, Stéphane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in his strange role and Geneviève Laroche is the perfect best friend. <br /> <br /> It could continue for hours before you find negative comments about this movie, so give it a try and add your own review.
