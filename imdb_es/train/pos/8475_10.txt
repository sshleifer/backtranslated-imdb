This is a fantasy movie for children based on the Legend of Boggy Creek, although I do not know why they called it Back to Boggy Creek like it was a sequel. This film has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy for children. Dawn Wells is the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around Boggy Creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid. Yes, it is very silly and the plot is corny, but this type of film is perfect for the group of 8-12 years that was addressed. It's a harmless children's rate with a G rating and, at least, you do not have to worry about leaving your children alone while they see you. Strictly for the set of 8-12 years old, older children will get bored and think it's boring.
