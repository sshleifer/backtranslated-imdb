In War, Inc. we find the logical extension of the current subcontracting of all war-related activities that we are currently carrying out in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with the pranks of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater abroad, you are already halfway to your home to fully appreciate the satire of Cusack's last piece. Cusack plays a corporate hit man named Brand Hauser who is in Turichistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while he hopes to gain access to his ultimate goal. While there, he is intrigued by the reporter against the establishment played by Marisa Tomei and persecuted by the overly sexualized pop star played by Hilary Duff. They present us Hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon who is actually running the whole operation for him (and who played hilariously with Joan Cusack). While some moments are played properly at the top, they are not always the moments you expect, and small details often surprise you. All directors become solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes, but otherwise, he does a very good job and goes a long way to dispel his Disney image. Tomei is fun but discreet, while Cusack himself almost all the scenes they are in. To be fair, they are given good material. The writers deliver a good script with twists and turns enough and visual gags to keep you laughing all the way to the predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the ending is the only thing that prevents me from rating it higher as the story revolves and turns the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your broad and physical comedy, it's probably not enough here to keep you interested in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you like sly comedy and broad satire, this is for you.
