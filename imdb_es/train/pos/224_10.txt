['The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite films of Feel Good. I saw it for the first time when it was the Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it came out and I loved it since then. I ended up watching it 6 times in theaters, and if I was playing today I would go see it again. <br /><br /> Now, many of the criticisms here mention the wonderful performances of the leads. Matthau was brilliant, but he had the misfortune to be nominated against the Oscar-winning performance of Jack Nicholson of Randall P. MacMurphy in &quot;Somebody Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest.&quot; Burns won, although Richard Benjiman also deserved to be nominated. Smaller roles were played to perfection, such as Fritz Feld in an audition for the commercial of French fries. <br /><br /> Which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film, the direction of the much underestimated Herbert Ross. Ross, who previously brought to the screen a play for two people, &quot;The Owl And The Pussycat&quot;, and made a full movie, does it again. Open the works without looking like a photographic play. He fleahens out of the story and the characters. <br /><br /> Here we are 20 minutes in the film before arriving at the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the special comedy. Although there is a dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is totally new. A few years ago I saw in the Broadway revival of the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful. But I think Ross and the screenwriter, dramatist Simon, improved on that. It&#39;s just a wonderful movie.']
