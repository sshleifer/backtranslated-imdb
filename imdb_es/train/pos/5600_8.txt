This is my type of movie. I'm fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that. But it is also a dark comedy. While I see it mostly as a horror thriller, there will be others who could see it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But either way, it's a fascinating descent into madness. The end took me by surprise, but what an ending! It leaves the viewer a lot to think about. <br /> <br /> Powerful presentations, a complex and detailed plot, a great script full of horror and humorous scripts, and a mysterious atmosphere make it worthwhile to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think I'll have to see this several more times to understand and understand all the subtleties that are inside. But it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a task to be done.
