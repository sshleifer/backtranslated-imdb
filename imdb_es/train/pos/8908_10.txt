First of all, I had not seen "The Blob" since I was 7 or 8 years old and seeing him as an adult was an incredible experience. You could write pages about his influence in horror movies even today. And even more could be written in their social subtext with the 50 "fear of adolescents." But this little simple tale of interplanetary horror is still a scary movie, if you let it be. <br /> <br /> Sure, it seems cheesy as they all come out in our modern world. But "The Blob" accumulates in some really frightening moments when a band of children tracks the unstoppable creature when adults do not believe them. In fact, there are even some pretty gloomy moments in your candy-colored world. And Steve McQueen offers much more than the story on paper deserved, that viewers really get caught up in the moment and believe in it. <br /> <br /> In short, if you can remove the filter of postmodern irony, There is much more to love here than meets the eye.
