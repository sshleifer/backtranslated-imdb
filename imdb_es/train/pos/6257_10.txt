This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely incredible. I saw him tonight on the Turner Classic Movie channel. I think I'll see if I can request a copy on DVD. The images of the film are not blurred and choppy as one might think of the silent film of B25 in 1925. Set in Iran in 1925, the people of the nomadic tribe in the documentary leave their home in the desert and cross a raging river , men, women, children, animals ... Then, on a snowy mountain, pass all Barefoot. It is to sink or swim and climb or die. In search of grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man carries a mule that is too sick to climb the mountain. The children in the documentary all look happy and healthy. They had such a hard life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran still live like this. It makes you appreciate modern life in the USA.
