I have to admit that I enjoy bad movies. I love them, I see them all. Especially the horror. My friends and I met after a hard week at school and worked, rented some crazy tapes, ordered a pizza and had fun. This had a large box, so I expected less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a housing project that is built on a nuclear facility that has knocked down the layers on the ground, and the other underground layers are simply covered. The inhabitants of this neighborhood find the facility covered when some children fall into a hole inside a cave. This awakens some zombies. <br /> <br /> As of this moment, it is a disorderly city. The bloody effects and the action never stop until the end credits end. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's not a great art, but this one, with its joking dialogue and its most important gruesome things, was our favorite of the night. In fact, it was one of the best "party ribbons" I've had the pleasure of seeing. And you could say it was made without money, with a group of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it is a wild journey.
