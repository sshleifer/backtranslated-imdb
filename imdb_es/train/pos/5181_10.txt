['I really enjoyed this film in general, but there are four things that stand out: the perfect comic timing of Sam Raimi as the skilful character of the camp (?), The wonderful characterization of Alan Arkin of the camp owner and, best of all, the cinematography. The beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes attract me to the film as a sunset on the shore of the lake brings me to my own memories of summer. <br /><br /> The dialogue and the mood feel very natural and credible. Some critics criticize the lack of a more &quot;deep&quot; script. For me, it&#39;s exactly that lack that makes this movie work. The characters and their problems seem real and that&#39;s why I&#39;m worried about what happens to them. <br /><br /> The conclusion is that all parties come together to create a whole that feels good.']
