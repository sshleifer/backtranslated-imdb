WARNING!!! TONS OF DEAD CONTESTS! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS SERIES! OR CAN, WHAT IS. <br /> <br /> There are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and leaves with another; Liars, cheaters, maybe even some words that can not be pronounced. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought the show had gone old and wanted to stop watching it, or the people who wanted their hero (or Villian) to stop at their last breath, this movie was the I had <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a parody of Wizard of Oz. Then you see a child named only John Doe, who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, who leaves and leaves Freddy's territory. A woman who resides in a hospital / place to take the children off her feet meets this boy, and at the same time, has a dream about a man, a water tower and the promise of a secret floating in his mind, She returns to Springwood to discover this frightening vision, and soon discovers that she is Freddy's daughter, and we soon discover that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a kind of host for him. And beyond that, fear ensues. This movie seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of humor and appearances, like Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and Breckin Meyer, a very young young man who plays a silly teenager who sees a psychotic view of flowers and "In-a-gadda-da-vida" from Iron Butterfly, is caught in a parody of Super Mario. This movie will make you hate this movie or you'll like Krueger even more. The best of the best.
