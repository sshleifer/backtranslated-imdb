This 1939 film tried to capitalize on Michael Curtiz's much better film "Angels with Dirty Faces". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how domesticated these children were compared to what is happening to young people in inner cities of the United States today. <br /> <br /> The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they were well paired. The children of Dead End have larger parts, since the plot focuses on them instead of the elderly. <br /> <br /> In a way, it's funny how the arson was used in the same way that some scrupulous landowners did in later years, right here in New York. It was the fastest way to change a property without taking into account the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many weapons around there is a new reality. The little children in the story seemed like simple pranksters instead of criminals. How the times change!
