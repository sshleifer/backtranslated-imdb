I love Monte Carlo and I really enjoyed this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very nice, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as the bewildered girl rejected with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as the bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a total idiot. Cybill Shepard gave a very good performance as an ignored and nice housewife. Enchanting ensemble cast A lot of talent, intelligent script, lots of activity and beautiful places. Just a nice pick me up for a sad day. Especially in the winter, when a trip to Europe is not anywhere on your horizon.
