['This movie had an interesting cast, it did not have a list of actors, but the actors that were in this movie did a good job. I&#39;m glad we have high school movies like this, the story is basic, the actors are basic and, therefore, the way they run it, does not need a budget of a million dollars to make a movie, just a mixture of common actors and a basic plot. I liked the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else and also what I found interesting is that they did not close a cafeteria to place the equipment and they did everything from a police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen did a great job in interpreting their roles in the situation of the hostages. This was a great movie and I hope to see it in the near future.']
