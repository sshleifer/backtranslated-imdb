The plot is really horrible, the atmosphere really depressing, unusual for a low budget production like that, and at least for a German production. A little bit of Indian spirituality, mystic thriller and mixed slasher movie. The development of the plot and the characters are excellent, the scenarios are very close to reality, without any study environment. It could be perfect, but, unfortunately, some things were a bit disappointing, which does not typically have to be for low budget movies: <br /> <br /> 1.) The cast is sometimes only average. Almost all the actors look like a layman. Some of them do a good job, or a very good job, but others act like the actors in the disgusting shows of the German court! But I was very disappointed with Mathieu Carri√®re's performance! His performance (in many of his old movies, his acting was fine) was below average! But that could be the reason why today he participates in soap operas or German television series on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) Dialogs are sometimes found at the telenovela level. <br /> <br /> 3.) The bad sound sometimes makes it very difficult to understand, what the characters say. I saw it on DVD and I was glad to be able to rewind and listen to it again. It is caused by the whole (big rooms like in the hospital or with the group esoterically) and, sometimes, by the strange dialects of the actors! <br /> <br /> But in general, it is an interesting movie that is worth seeing. , far beyond commercial films, which are often more terrible.
