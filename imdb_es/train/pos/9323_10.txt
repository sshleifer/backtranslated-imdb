For me, this movie was powerful. I do not want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend years ago; We were like brothers. This movie brought me some vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I could not cast my vote for this film, which would have been a 10. I received a message like "No votes have been placed ..." And yet I saw in the statistics that there was. I will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> Minor glitches that I overlooked. It was the relationships between the characters that got me. Beautifully acted and real situations. I've been to a couple of them. <br /> <br /> A little movie jewel. Like "Spring Forward" is another jewel overlooked. I am very happy that you are still making films like these; on the relationships between people, well written, developed with sensitivity, with action and first class management. After all, is not that what it is about?
