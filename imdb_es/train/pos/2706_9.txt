['I saw this movie at the Brussels International Film Festival. I also met the director of the movie. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I&#39;m sure he thought that his would be his masterpiece, his triumph. <br /><br /> Well, if you take the movie seriously (as Mr. Wood did), it&#39;s really one of the worst movies you&#39;ll ever see. And this is great. The great joke of I woke up early The day I died is that it does not even try to be a decent movie. <br /><br /> This makes the movie very, very good. The script is full of nihilism and anarchism, a lot of black humor. The role of Billy Zane is absolutely excellent. You see, this is high art ... or low trash. <br /><br /> **** / *****']
