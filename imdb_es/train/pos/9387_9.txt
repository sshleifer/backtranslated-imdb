As others have commented, I checked it after Siskel and Ebert considered it one of their 10 best films of the year. What a gift Then I went out to buy it, only to be able to lend it. <br /> <br /> The best offer? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is at the top of his cabin. When Cage looks down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Yoakum pushes his gun into Cage's face with "Does that look like I'm scared?" Much of the humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> There was really a sense of fun in this. The constant sighting of the "Welcome to Red Rock" signal causes a moan and a smiling head movement. The music created a hunt, a spooky quality for the movie that reminds of "Twin Peaks". However, unlike "Twin Peaks," he does not ruin things by going too far in the extravagant, and he needs to "outdo" himself. <br /> <br /> I admit that I see credits between 15 and 20 times. You see, they had "Thousands of nothingness" (perfectly chosen) from Yoakum playing like a freight train curved to the desert floor. . With mountains covered with snow in the distance. This was amazing, fluid framing. Also, I have never seen a better unification of sight and sound in the film. In addition, it fully fits the story.
