The music of Albeniz permeates this film. From time to time it is played with the original instrumentation (for example, piano, but never with full orchestra), but often it is returned to work with several contemporary sets (for example, guitar) and treatments (for example, jazz piano). Only from time to time music is the only focus of the film: most of the time the music takes place in several dances, often flamenco, but not always. I guess there are 12 ?? 14 scenes, which are not linked by a plot. Not all scenes will reach heights for an individual viewer. In my case, almost half reached the pinnacle, although the rest went very well in its own way. Those who worked for me moved me to the aesthetic delight of goose meat; In fact, the final scene left me crying with joy. And in a very magical way it takes you to the depths of Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The movie is practically speechless, although each scene carries a title of a piece by Albeniz. Watching this beautiful movie sharpens my complaint that virtually none of Saura's films is available on DVD in the United States. I think here particularly in its flamenco version of "Carmen", a spectacular work of art that is available in Europe but not here (European DVDs will not be played on American DVD players). This is a scandal.
