Modern, original and romantic history. <br /> <br /> Very good performance of Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman does a good job imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as the shy and bored employee. For men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and is very understanding. I forgot how beautiful she is. It is not difficult to imagine that John fell in love with her. Some unexpected twists in the story are good for suspense. Although I expected a happy ending, the last part of the movie was a big surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: huit points.
