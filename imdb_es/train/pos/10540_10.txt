['I can only agree with the taximeter that this is a fantastic movie and should be seen by a wide audience. The imagination on display, the visual interpretation of the script, the humor is constantly surprising. The two drivers are great and they really take the movie. My advice would be to not even see a trailer, just renten the film and look at it without expectations. I hired Blockbuster, so it&#39;s available in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it, but I think most people will have an opinion and that&#39;s always good, unless it&#39;s just &#39;that was stupid&#39;. I loved this movie, you just do not see gems like this every day. This should become a cult favorite. Try it, you can feel like me.']
