I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby will be released on DVD someday. The episode with the brother of the eccentric genius of Hilton, George (played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne), is a classic hilarity. It reflects the classic rivalry between brothers and the love between brothers whose lives took different paths, but both ended happily. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad brilliantly recovered the chemistry they shared on The Cosby Show for many years and by putting them on a more middle class paper, they show the dimensions they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> The list of comic dynamite ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius!
