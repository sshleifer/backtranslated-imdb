['The first time I saw this movie was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, it instantly became one of my favorites. <br /><br /> A River Runs Through: these are two brothers who each take a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the oldest of the two brothers and is on the path of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the rebellious younger brother who travels a road full of obstacles. The film follows these characters and each one follows its own path. <br /><br /> There is no problem in this movie. You will be entertained all the way through. The acting, the direction and the script are perfect. The two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score. They both trap you in the world that Robert Redford creates for you. <br /><br /> This is a great movie that is destined to be a classic. Surely it is in my book. If you have not seen this movie, definitely watch as soon as you can, as it will stay with you forever.']
