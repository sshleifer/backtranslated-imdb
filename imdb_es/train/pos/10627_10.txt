So, what constitutes a true independent film? We regret to say that what the general public tends to perceive as an independent film is nothing more than an intelligent marketing tactic. <Br /> <br /> That's why we should be happy that there are movies like "I hate a minute". On the other side of the board, this film highlights its contradiction with its own staff (independent horror film). I love him or hate him, "I hate" he is not afraid to be what he is, and when he sees this movie, he has the real feeling that Kallio (the director) not only made this film to spray fake blood all over the world. Place, he is in this to tell stories. Good ones. You can find this movie in the horror movie section of your video store, but do not be fooled, this story is about love, about good people pushed to the limit and that light so far at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect a fight, or an Evil Dead scam, get away from this movie. But if you explore the finer points of the horror / suspense genres, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell produced this movie, and I'm sure he's proud to tell someone that it's not "Evil Dead." Bruce has never tried to count on his "ash" image, and obviously he did not get involved with "Hate" so he could do it either. <br /> <br /> My advice, however, for all Dead-ites who ravenously devour anything emitted by Mr. Campbell is to review this movie anyway and see what else they try to show you Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell. <br /> <br /> The performance is well done, although none of this film is of the caliber of Oscar (perhaps intentionally), it is good to see compassionate performances in a horror movie. Very often, the actors of films like these do not even seem to try, with "Hate", it seems that all the actors took their characters very seriously, without resorting to the typical typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> Technically, "hate" is as competent as independent cinema. The editing is fast, the cinematography is good given the budget and "Hate" maintains a fast pace, without any point of bog down or bad climax. <br /> <br /> In general, Hate can not I've taken a look at all those multi-million dollar fake Indians, but personally, I do not see any problem with that. It's a movie of people who really care about the medium. The people who put their hands in their pockets, took out their coins, threw caution to the wind and made a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this.
