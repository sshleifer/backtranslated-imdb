It was an excellent piece for the series of puppets because this movie showed all the series, from one to seven. And it was a woman trying to stop the new puppet because she had never imagined that the puppets would have pain. In addition, he showed some of the master series of puppets that I did not see and that I see as bad as the second part. He showed a torchlike appearance that can turn things and human beings, which is great, and showed the return of the puppet master of the first part. He also showed small aliens from part 4 which was also great, showed episodes of other people that could be good for them and he did. So thanks to this Puppet Master it will be a great success.
