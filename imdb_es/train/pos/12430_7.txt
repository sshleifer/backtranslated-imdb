Normally, I do not watch action movies due to the fact that they are generally quite similar. This movie had many scenes of stereotyped action movies, but the characters and the originality of the premise of the film made it much easier to see. David Duchovny doubled his normal acting approach, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and made a great performance. Great deal all together. A must for boring people with the same old action movie.
