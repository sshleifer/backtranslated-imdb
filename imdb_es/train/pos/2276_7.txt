If you have read Mother's Night and enjoyed it so much (as I did) that you only have to see the film, understand that you must understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing: that beyond its history is Vonnegut himself , and that You can not put a human mind on the screen. His whit and his humor can not be transcribed by a script or even by the best performance. I think this film exceeds the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical satire moments found on the page are not on the screen. Does this mean that the movie loses its mark? Of course, no. In my opinion, the film is successful because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those who are too lazy to turn the page). It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of the true artistic treasures of the United States and presents it in an unpretentious setting. I have seen other versions of films from Vonnegut's books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and loses control of his own trade. I would not place this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one that is well worth watching. By taking Vonnegut's "voice" out of the movie narrative or trying to insert it as best he can, Mother Night tells her story brilliantly and retains the fundamental lessons of the story without confusion, distraction or disappointment.
