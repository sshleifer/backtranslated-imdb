I just watched The Drugs Years on VH1 and I love it. I think it reflects the history of drugs very well and, most importantly, IT HAS A STRONG MESSAGE TO ALL GENERATIONS. There are stakes, there are deaths of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and abuse. It completely covers the timeline and the evolution of drug use in the United States in a good or bad way. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate its creators because this is exactly what it takes to play on television these days. I'm waiting for the release of the DVD. You should definitely see it !!! This movie is awesome ... GREAT TIME!
