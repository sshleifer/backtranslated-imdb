I had mixed feelings for "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it, but in the end I liked it. I would not call it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is vulgar and unforgivably stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially women, would not like it or even hate it. It is the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way in which two anti-heroes treat every woman they meet would seem unspeakable. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it somehow reveals itself as a lovely little gem. I love how Blier was able to get away with it. The film is very entertaining and very funny: it is well written, everyone's performance is first class and the music is sweet and melancholy. Actually, when I think about it, two friends did something good for the women they met: they prepared a woman on the train (the charming and docile blonde Brigitte Fossey, who began her film career with one of the most impressive debuts in The "Prohibited Games" by René Clément (1952) at 6 years of age, for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months, found a man who finally managed to get a frigid Marie-Ange (Miou- Miou) excited and satisfied, they enlightened and educated the young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her first appearances on screen.) Her meeting with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level.In summary, I am not sure I would like meet Jean-Claude de Gérard Depardieu and Pierrot of Patrick Dewaere in real life and invite them to dinner, but I had a good time watching the movie and almost two hours flew, it was never boring.
