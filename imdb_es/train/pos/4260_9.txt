After the first work of Fatih Akins "Im Juli", which was quite good, he created a really beautiful Italian family epic. It's a German movie, which unfortunately is a bad precondition, because we rarely produce more than moderate movies;). But this movie does some very good snapshots of the time then. "Solino" is about an Italian immigrant who arrives in the "Ruhr" region of Germany during the 60s. The immigrant and his family start the first pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are excellent drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling you make. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not so good. Well, you just do not believe the paper. But the character is well balanced and fits perfectly in this script. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this film with the style of "The Godfather". Many people will probably hate this movie, they say it's boring. Not much tension? - Yes, but a scandalous movie. 9 out of 10.
