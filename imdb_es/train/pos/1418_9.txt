I almost did not go to see this movie because I remember that the march of the penguin was not so exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if I go to see it the first weekend, but after going to see it, it was just amazing; The fact that photographers can capture impossible images is simply worth their money. You can also see different habitats, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that will not only surprise you, simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic, but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity versus nature. world, of how our lives have deviated from nature to such a degree that we take for granted the natural beauty and miracles that are essential to our biosphere. You do not have to be a lover of the earth or a tree-hugging ecologist to appreciate the sheer wonder of this documentary. You just have to be a curious soul that questions the value and the miracle of living. Enjoy!
