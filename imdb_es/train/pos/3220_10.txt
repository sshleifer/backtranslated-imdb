The soldier may not have the academy performance or the special effects of Lucas, but he definitely does it for me. I will not tell you what it is, I'm sure you've read the summary. This is a great science fiction movie / action of the future. Kurt Russell does not say much, usually has a strange or boring expression on his face, but it fits the character. There are great scenes of action and struggle; Some of the scenes are not realistic, but that is what Hollywood makes us believe we should have to escape from our normal lives. I have not seen Soldier 2, but this is one of my favorites. I am lucky to have a wife who works in children's films; We both love this movie and we recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction and hard-core movies.
