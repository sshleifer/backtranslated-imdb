I had the intention to see this movie during the last months. Actually, I was surprised at how good it was. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who harass a child named Marty. They constantly harass him until one of them makes a terrible mistake that leaves Marty horribly burned. <br /> <br /> A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers is invited to their own high school, which is now abandoned by a party. However, none of the reckless teenagers has organized this party. <br /> <br /> Later, through the film, teenagers begin to die in the most frightening way possible. I can certainly tell you that they are also bloody. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you discover that everything was a dream and none of that happened. But, Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders did not occur, the burns and jokes apparently did occur. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible but it's fine. <br /> <br /> I love history. I really like Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The thugs get what awaits them in the end and end up feeling satisfied by the victim who is receiving his sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend to anyone who collects this if you are looking for slashers of the 80s. <br /> <br /> I give this film 8 stars out of 10. A good slasher!
