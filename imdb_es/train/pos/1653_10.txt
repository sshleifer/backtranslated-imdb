I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the 'spy' genre. My husband and I were captivated when it first aired in the US. UU And we watch each episode. At that time I tried to buy the series (I recorded everything), but WGBH told me that it was not available. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he could have a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complicated plot). If the original version is available on DVD, I will be among the first on the line to make a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was incredible. (He is always amazing.)
