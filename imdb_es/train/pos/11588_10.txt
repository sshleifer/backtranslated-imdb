['This movie was great and I would like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. the child has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops. the child prevents the eagle from being killed and flees from the tribe. The eagle helps to feed it by catching a duck from a small pond that the child scares. Later, the boy shoots a deer that a stalker boy claimed because his arrows were marked very close to it. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer. But this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even more cruel to him, and in the end they chase him on a cliff, but when you think he will fall from his pure love, the eagle will transform him into a golden eagle with only a collar as a reminder of who he was. Please, if anyone knows where I can buy this movie, let me know. I have not seen it for more than 30 years, but I still remember some parts of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com']
