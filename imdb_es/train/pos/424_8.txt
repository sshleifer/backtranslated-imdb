I love this movie because I grew up around harness racing. Pat Boone, behind the bad mood, reminds me of my father who was attracted to the trotters because, unlike the thoroughbred riders, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, 1944 Home in Indiana is a better movie, but it's also a very different movie. April Love is light and easy to see, a good movie. (Although I was disappointed that Pat Boone's religious and moral views prevented him from kissing the girl!) A pretty big change compared to today's standard rate.) Home in Indiana with Walter Brennan (filmed in black and white without the lesser idea that someone will explode in a song) captures stress and fight better, which makes the final achievement more satisfying but requires greater emotional investment.
