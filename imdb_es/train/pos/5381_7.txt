For a low budget movie this was really good. I put this well above your average action B movie. Sean and Corinne showed up in this movie, and they did not seem shy. Beware of the cameos of Jeanne and Jared. I did not think the producers would even consider it, but the runners-up deserve it. <br /> <br /> I will expect more participation from Sean and Corinne in the film entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very genuine, and Corinne's character appeal was quite hard and punctual. She connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence. It was a great idea to choose Billy Zane as the clever and clever villain. His charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good. The action sequences were not corny and seemed to connect throughout the film. Of course there were failures, but that comes with the territory. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for television. Sean and Corinne did a good job considering that they are new to the game. I hope that Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Next Action Star cast have the opportunity to also join their castmates in the success of the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Final Judgment: *** / ****
