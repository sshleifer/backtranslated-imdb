It is worth watching this movie for visual beauty and action in motion, but there is also an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and performers (both gathered in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are condemned to be relegated to subordinate roles in China. This makes the unlikely link between a street artist and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell with emotion became unnecessary because of the performance of the actors. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.
