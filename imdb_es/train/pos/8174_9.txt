I love this movie. When I was a kid, this was one of the first movies I saw that made me shudder. Sure, now it's soft, but in the past, it was amazing. Dentists are one thing that many people fear, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's corny, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's amazing. And I've always had a love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen perfectly interprets Dr. Feinstone, nobody could have done better. And for a low-budget horror movie, the effects are pretty good. And I also love the musical theme, it goes well with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also playing a meddlesome cop, and does a good job. There's a good amount of blood, and some really great torture / death scenes. Watch this!
