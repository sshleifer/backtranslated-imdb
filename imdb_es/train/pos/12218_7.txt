Japan is in serious trouble. The demons have infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and doubling them to his profane will. On top of that, the rebirth of Ashura, the queen of demons, is near. The only thing that opposes this serious threat is the Demon Guardians, a fearsome group of warriors, who could be as evil as the demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Izumo is a retired Demon Guardian who, five years ago, took theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing an innocent child (in a battle that strangely resembles the bar scene from Dusk to Dawn) One night, in a casual meeting, he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fortunes are intertwined (literally) and are bound by destiny to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy / Sword epic, you would be wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical of Ashura. It's a mix of different movie genres. The ones just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama and romance. The director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre in a very respectful way (although, the comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous but very funny popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> To be sure, there are flaws in the movie. Some of the humor seems devised, and out of place. And the performance is not the best. But seriously, do you watch fantasy movies / swords / comedy for great acting performances? No, we see them by the action and by the crazy visual effects of CG, that Ashura has in Spades. Not to be misleading, the film is not all action, but it is spaced generously with lots of green sword and bucket games to keep the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> In a few words; The film has its flaws and it is not an epic of martial arts, but it does not try to be and presents interesting images and good sword action. The reason why the movie worked for me is that it's never taken too seriously and, if the viewer does the same, he will surely be delighted with this fun and stupid fantasy action movie with a game of swords. <br /> <br /> My rating 7 out of 10. Fun popcorn movie.
