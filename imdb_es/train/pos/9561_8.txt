'' Ranma Â½ is my favorite anime from Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, which is not only a comedy, but also an action anime. The main character in the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenage boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is committed to Akane because of an arrangement of both parents, who are great friends and trained together for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is the youngest and most violent. Tendo's sister: Kasumi is the eldest and she is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle one and she loves to make money no matter what. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane fight all the time, especially because they both have a very bad When they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when she splashes with cold water and her father becomes a panda, many new characters and situations begin to happen. They also discover the reason for the transformation: while they fight, Ranma and his father. They fell into a cursed river. But not only they had this kind of destination ... <br /> <br /> If you saw '' Ranma 1/2 '' and liked it, I would recommend '' Inuyasha '' and '' Maison Ikkoku ", two others good creations from Rumiko's hands.
