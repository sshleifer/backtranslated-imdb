I'm a 53-year-old university professor. I went with my wife and my 12 year old daughter. We all enjoy the movie. The film is original, witty, fast-paced and totally charming. The plot was easy enough for a 10-year-old boy, but twisted enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did an excellent job and the rest of the cast was fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, makeup, costumes, lighting, cinematography, editing and direction were excellent. All in all, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against films that portray strong, intelligent and independent young women. His writings reveal more about his own sexist nature than anything about this wonderful family movie. I highly recommend it to all children and parents.
