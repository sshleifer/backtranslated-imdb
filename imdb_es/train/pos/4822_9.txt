Do you have to have someone holding your hand every time you go up or down the stairs? Let others taste your food before eating it? Facing a mother who supports too much? These are just some of the obstacles that young Victoria has to deal with in this movie (there are also the various struggles for power, as well as the attempts of her life). Needless to say, what makes it fascinating and informative. <br /> <br /> I had only seen Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada (and little else). As she was in that movie, she is once again the one featured here. I was very impressed by his portrayal of young Victoria and I thought that she handled the role very well. She makes the transition from the young Victoria we meet at the beginning of the film to Queen Victoria, who then becomes completely credible. Blunt is perfectly integrated into the paper, showing all the different sides (from the vulnerable, to the strong, from the young Victoria who makes mistakes to the Queen who takes control). You can not say enough about Emily Blunt in this role. She is, simply, exquisite, and she catches your attention every second that is on the screen. She keeps you paralyzed and includes the final shot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rupert Friend proves to be a well-interpreted person as the love interest of Victoria (and eventual husband), Prince Albert. The actors have good chemistry and you absolutely believe in your developing relationship. They have their disagreements, but it can be said that they are in love. Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene they share and they keep you interested in what is happening between Victoria and Albert. The other actors in the movie are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not a single bad performance in this movie. Less focused people are also well represented, given the short screen time they have. Even Victoria's dog (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dash) is memorable and has an impact on the film. <br /> <br /> Although the film tends to skip more than some aspects of Victoria's life, especially at the end - and instead * tells * us what happened (with her and Albert) on the screen, what the most important is what we * really * see *. This is, after all, a film about 'The young Victoria' (not 'The middle-aged Victory', nor 'The Old Victoria'). While there are some ornaments made in history with this film, it remains focused on what it sets out to do, which is the story of how the young princess came to power. <br /> <br /> The movie looks amazing, the costumes that Emily Blunt wears are visually stunning and the music just adds to the movie, it never detracts from her. It is exceptionally filmed and, unlike many movies these days, this movie is actually a good length, as it does not last so long that you lose interest or you feel that you are prolonging it unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that what makes this movie so great is Emily Blunt. She is in good shape here, delivering another excellent performance and elevating this film above what could have been, if another actress had been chosen for this important / historical role. This is a finely crafted film, with excellent performances that should definitely be seen. If you appreciate a fascinating look from a woman who was extremely important in the story, this is a must see.
