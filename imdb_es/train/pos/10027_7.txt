Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the movie will definitely change. The first time you watch the movie, you see the underlying love story and you think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one who thinks this) is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking: When is this ship going to sink? And even this is not so impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this movie is not bad, but it's definitely not great either. Am I glad that DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for that movie? I mean, who do you think it is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? It makes a good half movie and it will not make a movie for less than $ 20 million. And then everyone is surprised that there are almost no movies with him. But enough, in my opinion, with the worst character in the movie. The performance of Kate Winslet on the other hand was wonderful. I also think that the director is very talented to put together a film of such magnitude. There is a lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love stories, filmmakers should not try to add a horrible romance to each movie. Of a possible 100%, I give this film barely 71%.
