The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies that, in my opinion, are perfect. This little picture B is a tense story, well told. Alexander Knox has always intrigued me, but I have seen very few movies. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who becomes a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without a bit of remorse. The performance is one of the most chilling performances I've seen. Since the Second World War, the actors who played the Nazis or other evil types in movies have been occasionally nominated for the Oscars. I imagine that, since this was done during the war, the Academy felt that honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil. But Knox offers that kind of acting, a man so bitter and consumed with guilt that he does not think about making others suffer. I still can not get over it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays Filbert Gibbet or Social Butterfly, is one of the best performances I've seen. Maybe he's not worthy of Oscar, but the best of his career. Nothing against her; I enjoyed it in those "slight" roles that I played often. But here it shows that it is up to the task of a more intense drama. <br /> <br /> If you like human drama stories, or stories about the destinies of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis, I recommend this beautiful little movie.
