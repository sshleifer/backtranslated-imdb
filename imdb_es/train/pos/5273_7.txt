This was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon for many fans of horror movies after he directed the seminal and famous Cannibal Holocaust. However, do not expect to find such notoriety in the film that is reviewed here, as it proves to be incredibly docile in comparison and is more like an exit inspired by Conan for a young audience. <br /> <br /> Such a description can instantly discourage most fans of the entire Conan-inspired Sword & Sorcery genre, but before you pay attention to this, it must be said that this movie is very funny! <br /> <br /> It has been played mainly for laughs and presents two HUGE and very nice heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul, also known. The Barbarian Brothers, who seem to be having a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> Movie B's favorite, Richard Lynch, appears as the main villain of the piece and it's also great to see roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Added to this, the ladies are amazing to see and are dressed in little clothes throughout the duration of the film (a basic ingredient and very well received in the genre!) <br / > <br /> What can I say, - this is simply a very funny and cheerful version of the genre and I recommend it with all my heart!
