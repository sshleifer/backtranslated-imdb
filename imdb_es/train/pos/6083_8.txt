Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, best of all, Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow is all I can think to say about that. These are four of the most underrated actors in the business and they work very well together. It's like poetry the way they face and overflow with the natural ability to seem like they've been best friends for eons, even to film the movie. <br /> <br /> The film itself is fine and can be quite intense to see the first time, and the four stars greatly help the surveillance ability. I can not describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen, the best moment is when they look at a couple from afar and fill the voices for themselves, they almost make me cry. <br /> <br /> A good movie, a great cast, go see. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
