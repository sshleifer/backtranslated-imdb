Karen enters a Japanese house as a substitute nurse for Emma, ​​a strange woman who sleeps during the day and wakes up at night. Karen climbs the stairs after hearing noises when she encounters a terrifying ghost. She will learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It's very scary! The scenes are shocking and terrifying! The characters are good. The adjustments are creepy. I love the whole plot! The end was shocking! I paused in a scene where the little boy meowed so loudly the man who found his sister on the top floor and I was surprised. This is the most terrifying movie I've seen. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend it to terror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
