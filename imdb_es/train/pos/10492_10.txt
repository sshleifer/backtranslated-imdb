I saw Saving Grace right after he came out on video. Since then it has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complex but it does not take anything away from the entertainment. It is full of comical moments and has a very endearing quality. The characters are what makes the movie so good. Each has its own extravagant qualities that add to the humor, the two older ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law spring to mind. All performed excellently, particularly Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson were very well together to achieve some of the funniest moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I would definitely recommend this movie.
