The film cycle of Dana Andrews, by Otto Preminger, are among the most neglected jewels in the genre. Because they lack paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, they may have seemed out of place at that time, but the clear images, the complex game with identity, masculinity and representation, the subversion of traditional psychological principles, the austere and geometric style, Everything seems surprisingly modern today, and very similar to Melville. The lucid ironies of this film are so loaded, they are brutal and ironic that the "happy" ending is one of the cruelest in Hollywood history. Brilliant in the level of the entertaining thriller too, tense and full of double-edged dialogues.
