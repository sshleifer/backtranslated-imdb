I just bought and watch the DVD of this movie. The DVD transfer is from last year, 2001. This 1988 movie is really a great little movie. Ignored by most people. I saw him in the theater in 1988 and I've loved him ever since. I love the initial picture of Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as another user commented). It makes Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say that Pitts' tour in the garbage truck with Nicky is very picturesque and interesting! Tom Hulce, as everyone else has said, offers an extraordinary and wonderful performance. The DVD is a good transfer, without extras, but with a widescreen format. I recommend it to movie lovers.
