I did not approach "Still Crazy" with any real anticipation. Just another rock'n'roll photo, I thought ... good nostalgia for baby boomers. This movie is partially that, but much more. Brian Gibson, the director, previously directed a biography of Tina Turner and is quite successful in his style. I guess it's appropriate that this was his last film. <br /> <br /> The cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as leader of the band. The actor-turned-director Bruce Robinson appears as the band's finished guitarist. He does an excellent job, although he has not appeared in a movie since the late 70s. If you're looking for a moving and funny movie (with some great songs), you've found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
