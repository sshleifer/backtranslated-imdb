I must confess that this movie surprised me completely. On the one hand, I went to see him on a whim waiting for something mediocre, but given this, the most surprising thing was that this was in a populist American cinema. This is the British comedy at its best: dark, quirky and funny in ways that American films never are. However, I must stop wholeheartedly recommending anyone; I went to see him with several people, some English, some Europeans and some Americans, and although some of us loved it (mainly from the first two groups), some hated it and found it worthless. If you think you like this kind of thing, then go. If not, do not do it. 10/10.
