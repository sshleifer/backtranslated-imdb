When you are in a gloomy or depressed mood, go see this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday environment, and it is very encouraging, particularly from a feminist and humanistic perspective. <br /> <br /> When you know both Turkish and Danish or the German language, go see the movie anyway. Half of the dialogue is Danish in the original, synchronized with German in the translated version, the other half Turkish, subtitled in Danish or German, respectively. When I saw it in Mannheim, Germany, the reaction of the Turkish-speaking audience showed that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which, deplorably, escaped me in large part, since it only appears imperfectly in the subtitles. However, the film is interesting, even if you do not know the Turks. <br /> <br /> Aesthetically, the film is playing a lot on the subject of speed and slowness. At first glance, there are many rapid body movements like lightning, which makes it a fast and agitated movie. In particular, although this is a Kung Fu movie, be careful with the scenes in movement, which beautifully express a lot of emotions. But there are also quite a lot of very slow and emotionally intense scenes. And, above all, the characters develop at a much slower pace than would be expected in a drama about coming of age; even so, there is some movement in the characters to: Observe closely the villain Omar, whose part and performance I liked a lot. <br /> <br /> The contrast of speed and stillness contributes very well to the description of human rage and dignity. - It is displayed at the same time, in the same characters, at the same time.
