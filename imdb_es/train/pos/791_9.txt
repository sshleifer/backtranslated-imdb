When I did not know this movie before I saw it on the Rialto channel, it seemed like a nice, moving and enriching film. <br /> <br /> The casting was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a bit exaggerated in some places (but this IS a movie). The way it looked and the pleasant and dizzying journey that the main character took until it turned bad, as real life can. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested to see this movie once it started because people often joke about their acting skills (I find it quite strange because in my opinion it is always a solid actress). <br /> <br /> I loved the end part where Andy's character said "sometimes I feel he was never here", etc., he was as completely as he is in a situation like that (with which I can personally identify myself ), then there was that beautiful classical piece "Nocturne" I think by Chopin, it was a beautiful way to finish (excluding the light comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary). <br /> <br /> I say "well done" to the filmmakers: I've seen 1,000s of worst movies!
