I feel like I have a super rare disease that nobody has ever heard of and I've finally come across a support group in the network! I finally found this title by asking for an answer on a site of "experts" on the web. I, too, saw this film in my youth and I was impressed by the atmosphere and especially the end. I have never forgotten it and I have never seen it since. Nobody I know saw the movie and I almost gave up when I found his title. Unfortunately, even knowing the name, I will probably never see the film again, since it is impossible to find it commercially. Small steps ... <br /> <br /> G
