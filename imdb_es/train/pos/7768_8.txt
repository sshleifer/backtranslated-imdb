This gloriously turgid melodrama represents Douglas Sirk at his moment of greatest tension. Avoid the mild longing for "All that heaven allows" and the unfortunate sentimentality of "Imitation of life" and instead resort to fevered anguish and overheated tension. And, of course, everything is captured in vibrant Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Cornball's story has something to do with a friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack that turns into a rivalry when Hudson catches the affections of Lauren Bacall, but who is it? Really paying attention to the story ? Dorothy Malone won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her splendid performance as Stack's sister, who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will. The highlight of the film is when this wild and spirited girl gets into a frantic dance in her room, unable to withstand the restrictions imposed by middle class properties. As so often happens in Sirk's films, the scene is, unintentionally, hilarious in its absurdity and, nevertheless, strangely moving in its effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Sirk came closer than anyone to convert the pure camp into high art, satisfying the Philistines. and the high eyebrows at the same time within the same films. His was a unique talent and I do not know that there has been another filmmaker like him since then. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
