['He had heard about Eddie Izzard, but had never seen him in action. I knew I was a transvestite, and when I saw that I was on HBO one night last summer, I put it on, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, he blew us away. He is better than Robin Williams was. He has total control of the audience; when he does &quot;Englebert is dead, no, he is not&quot;, routine, the public does not know what to think at the end. God like James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the Spanish Python Inquisition, like the one carried out by the Church of England: &quot;Pastel or death?&quot; priceless. My jaws were sore from laughing at the end of the show. We went through the TV listings for months to see it again, and we were lucky to record it the next time it appeared. If you have the opportunity to watch this program, cancel everything and record, you will not be disappointed.']
