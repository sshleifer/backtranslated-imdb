['I have plenty of time for all the Columbo films, but this one in particular was extremely well written, and the solution at the end very effective. However, my main memory of this is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film, between Columbo and the murderer (I apologize if I do not remember exactly all the details of this). It is the most striking image of Columbo that I have seen: the view is from the darkness of the closet where the victim was murdered and towards the room that is beyond, illuminated by the light of day. Columbo is sitting in a high-backed armchair in front of the door (and us), looking at the closet and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in the light. There is no sound. The camera moves slowly out of the room and toward him. He is deeply in meditation, smoking a cigar smoothly, swirls of cigar smoke slowly turning upwards as he thinks. Then the dialogue begins. Magnificent.']
