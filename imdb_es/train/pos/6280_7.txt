If you like cars, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some excellent actors in the film, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical no-nonsense attitude and his hard-wearing appearance. The others are not bad either ... <br /> <br /> There are only two minor flaws in this movie. First, the poor plot, however, people do not see this movie for the plot. Second, the glorification of the great automobile robbery (car crime). However, if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it, then look at them well, I hope they have a good time in jail! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage was the main role, first I thought "... sweeet", but then I thought "... naaaa, you stink!" but then, finally, after seeing the movie, I realized that "... yes, it sucks!". Just kidding, he plays the role very well. <br /> <br /> I will end this unusual review by saying "If the premature death A criminal has somehow enlightened the general public of the cinema in terms of the gloomy end beneath the brilliant appearance of criminal life, and inspired them to change of attitude, then this death entails an inherent nobility And a supreme glory, everyone should be so lucky You can say "Poor criminal." I say: "Poor of us". <br /> <br /> ps: Angelina Jolie Voight looks great!
