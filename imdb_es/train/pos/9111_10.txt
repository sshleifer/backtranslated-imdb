"Capitães de abril" is a very good one. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. The fiction of the story is not of great interest, but it does not ruin the movie. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia are not exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the Revolution on April 25. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles perform marvelously. Lisbon looks beautiful as always. Do not miss it! I really liked this movie.
