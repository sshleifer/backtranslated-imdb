I think this movie was one of the good movies of Kurt Russels. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor, so I think he's a good actor in any role he plays. But this movie had a lot of action and I know I should have more than 5.6 out of 10 on the meter, but a lot of people did not like this movie. Oh, well, I thought it was good, so I think everyone should watch this movie. If you watch this movie and you like it, I think you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russel. I give a soldier *** 1/2 of *****
