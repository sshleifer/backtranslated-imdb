This film was proposed to be better than the average action movie and, in that sense, they achieved it. This film had a spectacular cinematography with spectacular mountains and heights, a very fit Stallone that offers a good performance, an exciting plot and a great movie. The performance of his main villain is because he will really surprise you with his evil ways. The movie does not have a big role due to the weakness of the screen. The plot and the history cry for this film to make Stallone a very special human, very similar The characters of the movie Rambo or Rocky or Bond. They chose to humanize the character of Stallone in this one that is fine, but considering the style of the plot, it weakens the emotion factor. Also, the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly patronizing at times. The script should have been more realistic and less "spoken". Another weak point were the unrealistic shooting scenes. Filmmakers should have been more careful in the way they shot and fouled. The quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the hijacking of the airplane at the beginning of the film. Instead, they decided to dilute many of the footage (to the "A-Team" TV series) as soon as the villains set foot on the track. Mountain summit. This movie had great potential of all time. More risky action sequences, better dialogue and more excitement / determination of Rambo / Rocky style by Stallone would have taken this film to a higher level. I know this was not Stallone's fault. I felt that the director of the film wanted to tone down Stallone's character and try to steal the film by taking credit for his direction, which was not so good if it were not for his director of photography. However, it's still a good movie ........
