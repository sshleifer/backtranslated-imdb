['Friends of Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel high school declare war on their peers and plan a terrifying assault on their high school. As they begin the deadly countdown to their last act of revenge, the two begin a video diary to explain their feelings and narrate their mission. <br /><br /> There is another similar movie like this, called &quot;Elephant&quot;. Why do I mention this? To compare the two movies, of course. I must say that, although I liked &quot;Elephant&quot;, this is a much better movie. What is the difference, you ask? Well, to begin with, this is taken differently, in the line of &quot;Cloverfield&quot;, &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; and &quot;Diary of the Dead&quot;. This makes the film better because it is much more painfully realistic. <br /><br /> But what convinced me was how the film was willing to show the &quot;other side of the story&quot;. You get to know these two shooters, unlike &quot;Elephant.&quot; In fact, I worried about one of the shooters and I could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This movie actually makes you feel sympathy with these people and that&#39;s good because it&#39;s not always black and white. <br /><br /> To be honest, that&#39;s why I almost cried in this movie. The characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions. You get to understand them. It&#39;s not that they want to kill people for attention. In general, this film is emotionally exciting and very disturbing and much better than &quot;Elephant&quot;.']
