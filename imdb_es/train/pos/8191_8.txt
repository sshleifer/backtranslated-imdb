The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit together comprise the two best episodes of the "new" season of Doctor Who. That said, it should be obvious that much of the story transposes basically the plot of Quatermass and the Pit (1967) to an external environment, with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the Beast 666. These episodes cement the emotional ties between Rose and the Doctor, while highlighting Rose's self-confidence, establish her as a companion who is not quite the same but who is coming with our beloved Lord of Time. Also worth noting is the elegant screenplay by Matt Jones, which decreases the excessive dependence on the Doctor's phrases, and the performances of the entire cast, particularly the excellent Shaun Parkes as Captain Zachary Cross Flane.
