The rules of personal taste when talking about movies like this treasured little jewel. In the eighties, in the early eighties, I discovered this film, like so many released at that time, "Night Patrol", "Bad manners" or even "King Frat", illustrations and smudges on the back of the covers tempted and deceived. you. <br /> <br /> Of course, being an era, movies like the ones I mentioned, as well as things like "Screwballs" and many others, captured the imagination and, fortunately, many years later I still remember some With love and some with disdain the many films that help to maintain my love for the genre as parodies or pastiches. <br /> <br /> Made many years after the huge success of "Animal House" and having seen how it went. Over the years, I now know that there would be no way for this film to eclipse the box office dollars that were obtained before or remain in memory, like the one of National Lampoon's Vacation. <br /> <br /> Be honest, not everything that the national Lampoon logo has been a great success, however, Me Class Reunion is still one of my favorite movies of all time, with recognizable characters instantly, as the distant Bob Spinnaker played to perfection by Gerrit Graham, so good in "Terrorvision" by Charles Band that still lingers in the past glories of his youth. Or how about Stephen Furst's brazen and carefree twist when the lazy vagabond of vagabond high school drove Hubert Downs mad? <br /> <br /> Sweet as. What makes me think As I said, personal taste does not resist. People can be so cruel, so they will never win any prize or be compared to their peers in the world of comedy. It has some merit. Being one of the previous scripts written by John Hughes, who later would make one of my favorites from his work "Weird Science", in addition to having a wonderful theme played by the great Gary US Bonds. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, it's a movie that's waiting to be rediscovered, again and again.
