Before entering politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the best cinematographic actresses in Britain. This film shows her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of a British Royal Captain who has lost the memory of the last 20 years, and Jenny played by the American Ann -Margret in almost unrecognizable role as the loving sister. Alan Bates plays the captain who suffers a loss of memory caused by the impact of the projectile during the First World War. Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role as the doctor who treats him. You see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can not help but see Glenda play a scruffy housewife and the first true love of the Captain, but they came from different classes. It's not the best movie, but it's good to see Glenda's incredible talent. She is still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. She makes Margaret Gray a nice character and you see why a royalty captain fell in love with her.
