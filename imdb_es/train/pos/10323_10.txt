This is a VERY entertaining movie. Some of the criticisms that I have read in this forum have been written by people who, apparently, think that the film was an effort for serious drama. IT WAS NOT DONE IN THE WAY ... It is an extremely pleasant film, made in the form of tongue and cheeks. All the actors obviously have fun while they entertain us. The fight sequences are animated, energetic and, above all, not gratuitous. The so-called "Green Death", used a couple of times, is not, as I read in a criticism, "appalling". A couple of critics criticized a lot the martial arts fight between Doc and Seas near the end of the movie. Hey, relax ... Once again, I remind everyone that this is a fun movie. Each phase of this "fight" was subtitled, which added to the fun aspect. The actors did not try to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is NOT one of those martial arts movies. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another good touch is the unique way in which the final fate of the "bad boy" (Seas) is addressed. I promise you that if you do not try to take this movie very seriously and simply look at it for its entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in the most pleasant way possible.
