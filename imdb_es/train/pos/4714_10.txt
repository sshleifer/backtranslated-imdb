['Famous words from the foreign owner of a nightclub, Roman Maroni, that &quot;pio sucker&quot; who spends the whole movie not only as Johnny Dangerously&#39;s rival, but also kills the English language. <br /><br /> Another understated classic that you can only find on the afternoon matinees or &quot;Late Late Late Late Show,&quot; Johnny Dangerously is a fantastic satirical hit about a good-hearted guy who leads a secret crime life to help pay attention medical of his mother and put his brother through the law school <br /><br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares? A cast that includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr will make you wait to see what happens next. <br /><br /> There are too many laughs in this to put here. Like Airplane, you must pay attention or you will lose something. Highly recommended for anyone who can use a good laugh or two!']
