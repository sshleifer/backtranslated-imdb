Did you know that the father of Anthony Kiedis, (singer of Red Hot Chili Peppers) is in this movie? Blackie Dammit, is Anthony's father. I noticed this after reading Anthony's autobiography "Scar Tissue," and I saw a picture of his father. I thought, "Well, that guy looks a lot like that guy from the movie I saw in the '80s, then I read more and I said that his father was an actor who had some small roles, after visiting this site and comparing him with a on the net, I realized that he really is his father in the movie, it's funny, because nowhere in the book does he mention him as a member of this movie, maybe his son was ashamed of his father's acting work in this movie But you need, I do not know, I think your father, Blackie, did a great job on the show.
