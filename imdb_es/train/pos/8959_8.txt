Although I agree that it is a good movie, but not excellent, for many of the reasons that other posters have mentioned, I still enjoy it. One of the reasons is the music: it would draw attention to the genial appearance of the Candoli brothers, Conte and Pete, in a scene well represented in the nightclub. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their time, and managed to impress Jimmy Stewart's mind convincingly by playing a hysterical trumpet duo, a trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. The Candolis really played very well too, although I suspect that the actual music for that scene was later dubbed by the two. I do not know much about George Duning, who gets the credit for the music (apart from that, he seems to have worked with the Three Stooges on more than one occasion), but the choice of the Candoli brothers as jazz witches was A good real touch .
