The paradoxes of time are the trap of the devil for underemployed minds. They are fun to consider in a 'what if?' sort of way Filmmakers and authors have dealt with this over and over again in a lot of movies and TV shows that include 'Star Trek: First Contact', the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill's Excellent Adventure and Ted ',' Groundhog Day 'and Stargate SG1 tribute,' Window of Opportunity '. "All You Zombies" by Heinlein, was written decades ago and will still make people read that story for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the case of the excellent film by Terry Gilliam, '12 Monkeys', it is difficult to establish what the problems of continuity may be with respect to the elements of the plot destined to make us rethink our conception of the movie. The repeated presentations will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, seeing the film for the first time, will consider Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as "the continuing harrowing experience" that visited time travel. <br /> <br /> Unlike other time travel stories, '12 Monkeys' is not clear if Future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that the time can not be changed, but scientists intercepted a phone call he made from the airport AFTER being sent back to 1996, on his own timeline personal. <Br /> <br /> Even this could be interpreted as an event that had to occur in a single timeline universe, to ensure that the timeline is not altered ... Cole has to die before the eyes of his youngest child yourself so that the destiny is realized. If that is the case, time is like a fluid, always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces that work in it. It's hard for the mind to think too much about this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> If you can change the future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people to the past, as we see on board The plane at the end of the film, then that means that the future It CAN be changed by manipulating past events ... or not? The movie has probably led to many drunken fights in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians. <br /> <br /> The extra material on the DVD makes it a very interesting visualization. Gilliam was under more than normal pressure to get the film out of the budget, which is not a particular surprise after the debacle of 'Munchausen' and in light of his latest attempt to film 'Don Quixote'. I would rate the documentary 'making of' as one of the most interesting I've seen. Certainly, it is not a rinsing and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflicts that arise between the creative people involved. Gilliam's description of the film as his "seventh" release, because the film was written by writers who are not himself and, therefore, not "his" movie "in itself, does not do the film justice in itself. <br /> <Brad Pitt's interpretation of Goines is curiously appealing, although his character is not particularly friendly, be alert to his slightly astonished look in one of the scenes of the madhouse, it is disturbing and distracting. /> <br /> It's probably a coincidence, Louis Armstrong's song 'What a Wonderful World' was used at the end of '12 Monkeys' and the final episode of the television series' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy '. The movie as the television series also featured the British actor Simon Jones. <br /> <br /> '12 Monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a chess game can entertain It is not a recreation meaningless, that's for sure.
