Everyone, my name may sound weird, but there was nothing else! <br /> <br /> Either way, I have not seen anything like this before, it was crazy! Of course that is a good thing. It's a movie with interesting humor and my favorite thing of all time is how other things intertwine in one! Like the hen, the fish that pretend to be King Kong and Runt the pig saying: "It was a beauty that killed the beast", the war of the world scene and more. The company of Walt Disney has NOT lost its touch, maybe not for this one. Also, how they did it as if they were watching a movie and it was like a home theater. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not fit. As in the original lion king, were not Timon and Pumba with Simba when he beat Scar? In this movie, they are not! They were fighting the hyenas behind the scenes. Moreover, the reason why Pumbaa does not have that much confidence is because the other animals pushed him and also, only Timon, Timon, Timon. Does anyone realize that only the story of Timonn was told, while the pumba only had flashbacks? <br /> <br /> But apart from that, IT IS BIG!
