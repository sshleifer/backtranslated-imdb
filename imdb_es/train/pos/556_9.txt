Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their flock from Seattle to Alaska and then to Canada to claim. Once there, they have to deal with the seductive and carefree businesswoman Ruth Roman and the villain James McIntire, carefree and with a lot of ice. <br /> <br /> John Wayne can be talked about more, but his good friend Stewart did. some excellent and hard westerns too, some with the great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I would take this, with its sturdy action sequences and excellent melodrama, about North To Alaska any day! <br /> <br /> The distant country presents an impressive scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been filmed on a wide screen. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is strong support from Brennan, Roman (who is great), Corrine Calvet, incredibly cute, and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy, the guy that he does not take himself too seriously. <br /> <br /> This would be a great double bill with another highly recommended Mann / Stewart located northwest, Bend Of The River.
