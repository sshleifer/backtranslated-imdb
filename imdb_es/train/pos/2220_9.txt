['We tend to forget that the master / slave context of past centuries leads to more than well-kept properties, fed by large groups of slaves and a lot of money for white owners. This led to a group of people trapped in the middle: the offspring of the slave owners interfering with their slaves. <br /><br /> Some of these children simply became more slaves, and others were free ... but free and colorful, which at that time meant nothing, in relation to the quantity of their bulls. <br /><br /> A class was formed around this offspring, the gens de couleur libre or people free of color, and that class was able, to some extent, to own property, rise from pious to educated and achieve a comparative dignity. That is, they were not slaves, but even so they were exploited to a certain extent. <br /><br /> Often, women lived as kneaded masters of white plantations and rich men, established in their own homes, with subsidies, school education for their children and a kind of kindness, dependent on the respectability they chose to impose their children . families In essence, they prostituted themselves to ensure their own prosperity and relative independence from work, an arrangement called pla√ßage. <br /><br /> Feast of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one of those women, the result of such an agreement with a local gentleman and the people who touched their lives, both negatively and positively. The story was a revelation for me, a New Zealander, without a real conception of the black / white lines, much less that gray area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre stepped cautiously. <br /><br /> The characters are very three-dimensional, and have been well represented in this adaptation of the novel, by Anne Rice. The parts are well fused, the costumes are wonderful, and the brutal way in which the lines are drawn, with the blurred areas that are further distinguished by the conflicts that the protagonists go through. The free gens de couleur could not marry whites, slaves could not help themselves, and whites, even sympathetic ones, could not bear to face the economic reality of doing good to the people they depended on. <br /><br /> I recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, to everyone, without reservations. If you can not handle the truth, you will shudder and shrink in some places, since one injustice after another is imposed on those of color, both by their white oppressors and by their own people. Keep in mind, however, that this is only a reality, and this story is an absorbing way to learn about it. <br /><br /> I know it may sound insensitive, but this miniseries entertained me and captivated me, despite the bitter taste I found in my mouth for what happened, and I enjoyed it immensely. Look at it. If you do not read about the period, because there is a lesson to learn from everything.']
