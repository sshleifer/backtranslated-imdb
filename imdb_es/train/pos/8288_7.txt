Good sequel to Murder in a Small Town. In this case, Cash and his police colleague, Lieutenant, unravel a sticky plot involving a Nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch and a family of errors and wierdo helpers. As in the original, the viewer is treated to a small mystery with distinctive images and sounds of pre-war America. Go see it.
