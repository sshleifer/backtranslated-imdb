When my sister said that this movie was going to be good, I thought twice, but I saw it and it was really funny. Basically, the movie is made of a strange girl who goes to a small town where nobody likes and just wants to go there and read to her aunts so she can go. But it's not so easy. In this film you will find a hilarious humor, a witch, a book of spells / compilations, an uncle with mental problems and a dog. You will understand the meaning of the word freak to, anyway, I hope you run out and try to find this really old movie. I hope you like it in total, I'll have to give it a 0 ... no, I'm kidding, I'll give a 9, I hope you understand that you'll laugh, scream and maybe get offended. <br /> <br /> really love yours: Dakota, you can send me an email to dakota_loves_it @ hot mail.com if you want
