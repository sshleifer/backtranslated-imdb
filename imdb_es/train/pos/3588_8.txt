When I saw this movie, I was surprised that it was just a television movie. I think this movie should have been in theaters. I have seen many movies that deal with violations, but this one stands out. This movie has a kind of realism that is rarely found in movies today, much less in television movies. It tells a story that, I am sure, is very realistic for many rape victims in small cities today, and it seemed very credible to me (which is something difficult to find in other films focused on rape). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were incredible in the parts they played. Definitely, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a harsh reality. I enjoyed it a lot.
