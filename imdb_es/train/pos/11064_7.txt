"I'll take you there" talks about a lost man who loses his wife with another and finds an unlikely ally on a blind date. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mostly ironic situational comedy, with Rogers and Sheedy with little emphasis on romance. A kind of road trip with lots of fun and some poignant moments keeps moving, stays cool and is a watch that is worth it for indie lovers.
