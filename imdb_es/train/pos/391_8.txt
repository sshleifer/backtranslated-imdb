"Zu: the warriors of the magic mountain" was and is an impressive classic! You would never have guessed what was done in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (He continued to do this in the trilogy of Chinese Ghost Story and later productions). Even now it can be at the height of other films in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is connected to "Zu" warriors of the magic mountain. "It is not necessary to have seen this film to understand the plot of this ... The plot is a bit hard to follow, but to be honest, it is not. The most important thing is action and adventure, I always wondered what Tsui Hark would do if he had CGI in his hands, now we know he made this movie, maybe it's too much, but the overall result is very important. I'm not going to be critical of that, there are so many things happening on the screen that you just will not believe! I think it's a great pity that this movie has not been seen in the cinemas of Holland. This film can easily surpass Hollywood's big-budget productions such as "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I have to mention is the lack of humor, and in most of the Tsui Harks films it combines the drama, fantasy, art Martial and humor, somehow missing from this movie. Again I will not be demanding But these little matters. "Legend of Zu" is presented on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you'll see. A true classic!
