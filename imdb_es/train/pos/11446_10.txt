Right at this moment I'm watching this movie for the second time (on TV) and for the second time I fell into it when it was already an hour long (I think I saw 2 more minutes this time) This movie is really awesome, the way that Goldsworthy looks at nature, changes nature in a way that you would never think, it really is incredible. This whole movie gives you a feeling of warmth when you watch him play with the world that surrounds him with so much love. Or just watching his hands, covered with dirt and broken nails, just touch you.
