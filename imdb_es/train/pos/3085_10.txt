I saw the episodes without broadcasting online and I was so sad that the program will not come back. He had the best cast of mature, talented actors and incredible chemistry. It seemed that all the actors are personal friends in real life. Towards the end, the show became sexy, sexy and highly visible. Of course, some of the story lines are not realistic, so ... The characters are nice and you support them. The show reminded me of a cross between 2 other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Great congratulations to the entire cast. Note to ABC executives: Nielsen's rating reports do not show actual results. The audience of the show will record it mainly. I am very disappointed with the main networks for flooding us with reality television programs or oriented to teenagers. Why do we have to change to HBO or FX to get a mature, reflective and well-acted material? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online. The new means of transmission will gain more and more popularity among the spectators.
