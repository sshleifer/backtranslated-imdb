According to the book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes, which deals with Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy and Randolph Scott, the author says that Albuquerque was the only movie that he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost. He had not seen himself in years. <br /> <br /> The good thing for Western fans was that someone was doing a spring cleaning in Paramount because apparently they found a footprint and now it's in the open market. Albuquerque is also a good western with Scott involved in a family fight with Uncle George Cleveland. <br /> <br /> George Cleveland sends his nephew Randolph Scott with the intention of making him part of his cargo business, based in the fast-growing settlement of Albuquerque. Cleveland is more than just a businessman, it's the city's boss who runs from a wheelchair. He even has the sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero at all. That includes not supporting family members when they are villains. He goes to work for a rival team headed by his brother and sister Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig. <br /> <br /> Cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and even sends a Western Hari Mata in the person of Barbara Britton. to penetrate the confidence of its rivals. Barbara is great as the homemade slut who develops her own agenda. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's original studio was Paramount, it was where his first study contract was. Albuquerque marked the last movie he did for Paramount and they gave him a good one. <br /> <br /> Also keep in mind Lon Chaney, Jr., who is the trusted man of George Cleveland, a rather disgusting bully of a man and Gabby Hayes, who is simply Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> Albuquerque must have been loved by Republicans across the country in 1948 with its main villain as head of a city that rules from a wheelchair. A certain Democrat from a wheelchair had made them four consecutive presidential elections and he had left. They also had high hopes of winning the White House that year, but things went wrong and they had to settle for an Ersatz boss getting his due in Albuquerque. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was actually done in the plot. I guess he got injured and played the role that way because he had to. <br /> <br /> Still, Albuquerque must have had great appeal for the GOP market.
