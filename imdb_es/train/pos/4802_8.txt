['I just watched this episode tonight, in a presentation recently added by one of our independent local channels, which now features two episodes each day of the week. <br /><br /> As the gentleman said in the previous comment here, I agree that this has not been one of the best programs of the series, but I find it entertaining. <br /><br /> My father was a friend of one of the directors (in my hometown, Cincinnati), for whom the young Rod Serling had worked in the media there, and I remember that Dad told how talented and creative he was remembered there. In general, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; is undoubtedly one of the true classics of television, and given its production during the height of the Cold War period, it offers not only a vision of this era in the country, but also (today) a nostalgic image of production. Techniques, creative points of view and the actors of this era several decades ago. <br /><br /> * Minor &quot;spoiler&quot;. * <br /><br /> This particular story shows, like other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story in which the venue intends to provide a &quot;surprise&quot; ending. Sometimes, the characters are on earth, on the other hand, while the story at the beginning implies that at least one is an &quot;earthling.&quot; These generally contained the message (as here) of a situation caused by the buttons of the end of the world that were finally pressed by the super powers during this period of the Cold War. <br /><br /> Seen today, stories like this offer a nostalgic view of this mundane view of 4 or 5 decades ago, and still provide some reflection. - Like this episode. <br /><br /> While the dialogue may not have extended the considerable talents of the potential customers, it still presents a simple and important message, and about 20 minutes worth of entertainment and interest.']
