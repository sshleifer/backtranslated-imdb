I saw it in theaters and absolutely adored it. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain I've seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a maid in heaven. This movie also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as the Blue Raja, and I especially loved that the character was not really British. The scene with him and telling his mother that he was a superhero almost made me cry. I loved the fact that The Bowler talked to the ball. Some of the funniest things involved Stiller and his character, Mr. Furious's fake fury, and the fact that his threats and front-line phrases were all bad words, and that they never made any sense. I could barely avoid applauding when he said "Fraculater, Freinken-puss," he told himself. But one of the things I enjoyed the most was that Captain Amazing really dies in the movie. I recommend this movie HIGHLY for any occasion, and I give it my own personal approval.
