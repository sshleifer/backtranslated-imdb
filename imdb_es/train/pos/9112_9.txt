Being half Portuguese does not leave me half blind (or half prejudiced) when talking about Portuguese films. It's not like I have to do it very often anyway. But this movie was a rush of adrenaline! Yes, it's true, it was quite accurate to the extent that the story went by, but he made no effort to venture beyond the usual territory of the Portuguese film: things like using real places in the middle of the congested Lisbon traffic zone and Recruit a real crowd to Support the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. And for God they did it well! Well, to summarize: very emotional if you have lived it, but you will see minor improvements that could have been made, as well as the needs of the plot that were. If you only see it at random, a good historical game awaits you, just from the very recent history type and a little more tested than usual. Even by European standards, yes.
