I love both the bed knobs and the brooms that make me cry tears of joy every time I have the great pleasure of seeing her. I would also like to reiterate the simple fact that I love it so much. Too much, some have said it. I have 27 copies on video and I love them all equally. I also love any other person who loves him. I love you My favorite scene is the dance scene on Portobello Road. I have learned the dance movements and I practice it every day. I have some audio recordings of myself singing the song. If someone can play the drums or the guitar, I'm thinking of forming a band of bed knobs and brooms. I hope to call it 'the knobs'. love me (liz)
