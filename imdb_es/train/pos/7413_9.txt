['The shower stays within itself in many ways. Almost the entire film takes place in a bathhouse of yesteryear, with the inhabitants of the city who provide humor, pathos and emotional touches. The love and friendship between the owner and his late child is profound and moving. The way in which the older brother is attracted to this small world seems unforced and persuasive. The plot is meandering, full of surprises and ironies, and generally moved by a sense of what should be called neighborhood in the relationships and conflicts of artists. This is a movie I take when I want to believe in the world again.']
