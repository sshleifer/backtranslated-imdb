Finally, a thriller that omits the persecutions, explosions and other striking effects. The film combines a simple plot (murder of a French president) with an excellent background. Observe the behavior of the man before the authorities, and explain why we would obey almost all the orders (including murders) that would be delivered to us. <br /> <br /> In addition, it shows us how the secret services can manipulate the operation of history and how difficult they can be controlled. The best thing about this movie is that there is not a classic "Hollywood ending" that can easily be predicted.
