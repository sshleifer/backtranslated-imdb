At first you think of another Disney movie, it could be good, but it is a movie for children. But when you look at it, you can not help but enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. The first time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old and now, 8 years later, I still love it! Danny Glover is excellent and could not play the role better. Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the part. Tony Danza is as believable as Mel Clark. You can not help, but to enjoy this movie! I give it a 10/10!
