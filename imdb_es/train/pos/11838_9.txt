This is one of the quietest, most relaxed and beautifully made animation movies I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! This movie is not only great for children, but also for adults. It teaches you lessons, like never forgetting who you are, you can do whatever it suits you, and be brave and daring. This movie can also make you cry sometimes, which is always a good touch in the movies. This movie is fun, sad, cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after watching them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a lot of spirit!
