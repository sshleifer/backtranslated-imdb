"The Woman in Black" is easily one of the most spooky British ghost stories ever made. A young lawyer, after arriving in a small town to handle the property of a dead client, is chased by a mysterious woman dressed in black. The film is loaded with an extremely spooky atmosphere and the shocks are calculated and give the maximum possible effect. The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the ending is quite disturbing. The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times. So if you want to see a really scary horror movie. Look at this person. I dare to see "The woman in black" alone at night with the lights off. Highly recommended 10 out of 10.
