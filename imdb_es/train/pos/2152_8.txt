There were some great moments of reality that represent modern life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how stifling culture can be, and wanting to get out of the mold has been created for you. <br /> <br /> The dance was just a vehicle to say "do what you love, even if it's against the norm". More like Billy Elliot as I would say. I also enjoyed that movie. <br /> <br /> The humor was very timely, and the moving moments felt so real that you could feel the discomfort between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the ballroom. I loved Aoki, he and that wig and his excess on the dance floor made me just howl! <br /> <br /> All the actors did a wonderful job, the story was well written. I saw it a second time and I picked up some small nuances that I missed in the first visualization. Good entertainment!
