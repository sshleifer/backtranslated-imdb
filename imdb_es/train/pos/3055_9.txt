Henry Brommell, who first served as director of Hollywood, makes a fascinating spell that presents all the marital problems related to melancholic authenticity, and is related to an equally absorbing secondary plot of a father and son business. The film is craftily directed and consists of a wonderfully organized cast and a quick family script (also by Brommell) that gives life to a fatigued genre. As an additional benefit, 'Panic' offers a subtle and biting humor, an unexpected surprise, undeniably charming and very welcome through its clumsy, insecure, low profile star, whose always fresh state is attractive, especially given its line of work. <br /> <br /> The ever-great William H. Macy recaptures our hearts as Alex, an unhappy, broken-hearted, middle-aged husband and father who finds solace in the most dubious people: an attractive 23-year-old girl, equally disorderly, named Sarah (Neve Campbell), whom she meets in the waiting room of a psychologist's office, where she waits for therapy from Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) to discuss her growing enthusiasm for leaving the family business she built his father (Donald Sutherland). Alex, whose lust for leading a new life is hampered by the fear of disappointing his father dictator, scares Sarah, which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and, what more importantly, he is a good father to his six-year-old son, Sammy (played enthusiastically by the beloved David Dorfman). <br /> <br /> The brilliant 'Panic' by Henry Brommell is rare in Hollywood that is rarely seen (with the exception of the "Road to Perdition" in 2002, since its conception in 2000, weaves two genres conflicting (organized crime, family drama) in a fascinating and warm movie viewing fragment that is equally strong in any direction and is one that will maintain its exceptional, rare caliber and resplendent sincerity for the ages to come.
