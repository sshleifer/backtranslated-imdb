The plot of this fun musical MGM is devised and only occasionally is fun, it is about espionage and romance, but the focus of the film is aimed at the enthusiastic interludes that show the enormously talented and athletic dance ball Eleanor Powell, instigated by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, with Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares the highest level of turnover with Powell, and he and his partner Bert Lahr receive most of the comedic minutes, although Skelton is more effective when he, if you can believe it, presents himself as Powell's love interest, with Virginia O'Brien who actually provides the majority. From the humor of the film as a companion of the dancer. Powell's technical brilliance is evident during an incredible scene in which Buddy Rich contributes with his drums skills, and that must be seen several times to allow one's breath to reach its precision. Director Edward Buzzell uses his great cast well to advance the action despite the rather unrelated script he has to contend with, and allows Powell's impossible possibilities to rule the issue, as appropriate.
