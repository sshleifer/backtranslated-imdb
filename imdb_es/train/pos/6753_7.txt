The classic classic of Otto Preminger works almost like the other side of LAURA ... while the film was ostentatious and presents Clifton Webb's classic, this film is much more elegant. Dana Andrews is a bad cop who accidentally kills a man only to have him potentially trapped in the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving at a rapid pace so that errors in logic are easily overlooked. Andrews is pretty good (much less wooden than in the past) and the incredibly beautiful Gene Tierney is incredibly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unfortunate victim. WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must-see and an excellent accompaniment piece for the equally creepy WHIRLPOOL from Preminger (also starring Tierney).
