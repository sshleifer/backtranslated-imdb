This is perhaps the best rock musician of all time: a British, better This is the spinal punch. The characters are believable, the plot is great, and you can genuinely empathize with some of the events, such as Ray's problem with the adaptation in the band. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. Things of the real period, even if it is in the same key, you will be humming some of the songs for days. What I liked was the almost entirely British cast, with some of the favorite household names. Ray's wife is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The film never goes on, it just goes at the right pace and has some really fun sections. A generator of some really good phrases! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
