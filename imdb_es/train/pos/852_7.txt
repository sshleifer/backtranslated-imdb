THE MATADOR is a hit-man lite movie ... if you can say that about a hit-man movie. Violence is never really shown, but it is often introduced. At first, I was scared because I was in another relapse of the dark gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy of the 90s, but I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship . Nothing terribly exciting happens in this movie, but all that keeps me smiling. The three protagonists have the best chemistry that the big screen has offered in recent years and it seems that they had a great time making this movie together. The writing is clear, although sometimes it felt as if the script had been adapted from a play due to the scenes of a single dialogue. This is a good movie that I probably will not remember for a long time, but at that moment it was a total joy. Good movie.
