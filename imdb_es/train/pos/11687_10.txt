My liking for Chris Rock varies with his films, I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4, but I hated everyone in that movie. I like it when he is himself and does not stop, as in Dogma. Well, this is your best moment, I did not expect this to be so good. I laughed all the time. Chris Rock offers a sweet and wonderful story backed by the funniest comedy I've seen in a long time. I loved.
