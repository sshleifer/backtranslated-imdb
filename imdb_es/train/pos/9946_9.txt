Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There were some notorious errors, but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time. I did not feel any need to move quickly during the film and it seemed quite entertaining. It gets a bit silly at times, but I generally recommend it. They probably exhausted all the brightness in nearby stores, and some of the costume designs were pretty good.
