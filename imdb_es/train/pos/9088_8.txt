When we talk about Hollywood Hotel, we can talk about one of three things, the real hotel, the radio program and this movie that was partially inspired by the first two. Dick Powell was the host of the Hollywood Hotel program on the CBS radio station in which Louella Parsons delivered the weekly premiere of the stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons debuted on the Hollywood Hotel program in 1934, so by 1937 there was already Their fair share of the radio audience. Powell received, sang and sang with Louella and his movie star guests. With the power he had with his column, he was able to get several stars to go ahead and connect his latest movies for nothing. <br /> <br /> Then, the American Federation of Radio Artists intervened and demanded that I pay the salaries. Consequently and they won the case. That ended the Hollywood Hotel program in 1938. Of course, both Powell and Louella went to other radio centers. The whole story is covered in Tony Thomas' book, The Films Of Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before the subject was removed, this movie came out of Powell's Warell Brothers studio, inspired by the radio show. Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with the Benny Goodman band that is signed with a Hollywood contract. But when he leaves for Hollywood, he becomes entangled with a selfish movie star, Lola Lane, his real life double sister, Rosemary Lane, and an actress from Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called to sing in a Civil War epic he's doing with Lola Lane, it's Powell's voice they use. Then, Mowbray develops a problem with Lina Lamont when asked to participate in the radio program of the Hollywood Hotel, broadcast from the Hollywood Hotel. That has the study in a tizzy. Let's say the problem is not solved as Singing In The Rain, but Powell's manager, Ted Healy, proves ingenious. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer provide a very good score for the film. The great song arrives right at the beginning when the band of Benny Goodman with scat singing Johnnie Davis sings the hymn of Hollywood, Hooray for Hollywood. My favorite, however, is the singing of Powell and Rosemary Lane, I'm like a fish out of water. Just listening to Johnny Mercer's lyrics about Ginger Rogers running the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without his fan, is a compendium of American popular culture in the thirties. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley choreographs here and while the movie does not. Not having the imaginary things that his previous work with Warner Brothers has, the numbers are well organized. The great moment of Berkeley is in a self-service restaurant where Powell and Healy have been forced to accept jobs. The number begins with the broadcast of Benny Goodman from the Hollywood hotel with Let That Be A Lesson to You, and then drive-in Powell, Lane and the whole place begin to join the exasperation of owner Edgar Kennedy. And you know what you can expect from Edgar Kennedy's exasperation. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman demonstrates why he was named the King of Swing when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and the xylophonist Lionel Hampton was part of his ensemble. That along with Frances Langford singing too. And, possibly, the last member of the group that survived was a partner who had little time as a radio announcer. He died in 2004, but not before becoming the 40th President of the United States. Ronald Reagan always recognized Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as the two types of Warner Brothers who were the most useful for a young and enthusiastic player who seeks to make his mark. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel is one of the charming and entertaining. Film, date, but with charm.
