The story: on the island, Texel, photographer Bob, who does a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. His free spirit and lust for life intrigue Bob, who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. However, his life is not as simple as it seems. Through Kathleen, Bob becomes entangled in a dangerous network. Can Kathleen gain her trust? <br /> <br /> Review: the dialogue in this film is very natural and the story unfolds very well, although it remains a bit on the surface and would have been good if the character was "Psychology would have developed a little Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choices? This is what gives a depth of film and something to think about in my opinion.The story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters they spend enough to justify that, then you do not know the characters at that deeper level, the actors do a good job and an interpretation in a very natural and "credible" way, but I think it would have been better for the film if Kathleen would have been played by a younger actress, since the naivety of this character does not work for an adult woman above The camera work is nice, and there are some great images of nature on the island. I give the movie a 7/10.
