The young, handsome and muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York thinking he will make a living as a stallion. He arrives there and quickly discovers that it will not be easy: he goes through one degrading experience after another. At the end of the rope, he gets hooked with crippled and crippled Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and leave the city and move to Florida. But will they succeed? <br /> <br /> Very dark film, disturbing but fascinating. Director John Schelsinger paints a very dirty portrait of New York and its inhabitants. That way it's dated: the city may have been so bad in 1969 but it's already been cleaned up considerably. He also uses all the camera tricks in the book: the color changes to black and white; sequences of trippy dreams; flash forward; flash backs (especially involving a violation); shock cuts; Rare sound effects ... whatever. It keeps you disoriented and out of the center, but I could not stop looking. <br /> <br /> There is not much history, basically it focuses on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the final shot shows that). It's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel and urban jungle. <br /> <br /> This was originally qualified as X in 1969, the only reason is that the MPAA did not think that the parents would like their children to see this. However, it was a great success among high school students (at that time X meant that there was no one under 17). It has also been the only X-rated film that has won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Hoffman and Voight were ready for the acting awards just like (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles, who was in the picture for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes! Finally, it was reduced to an R (uncut) when it was reissued in 1980. <br /> <br /> Also the excellent song "Everybody's Talkin '" was introduced in this film and became a great success. br /> <br /> A great movie --- but very dark. I give it a 10. DO NOT watch it on commercial television, it's cut to pieces and incomprehensible.
