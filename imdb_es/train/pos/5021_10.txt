I rented this movie and saw it 20 times before taking it to the store. Bill Paxton hired some top-notch talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton offer good results. The story is told in an interesting way with two retrospective scenes 20 years ago, then appearances in the present, alternating again and again. This style of narration is a good thriller that can not be bored. Bill Paxton, please make more horror movies, you have the talent for it!
