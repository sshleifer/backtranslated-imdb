I went to the bar hoping this was a hot beer on a stifling Texas day, but I was pleasantly surprised. After suffering the "Saturday night nonsense," I had no desire to see a new version in a South Texas farmyard ... and I did not. John Revolta was good as the jealous bum, Scott Glenn was a former thuggie singer, and Debra Winger was, as always, a delight. * Love that woman * Also, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy who can not stand the sound of country music]. A funny movie all the way.
