Before watching the film, I did not know anything about the film and I think it was the "no expectations" factor that helped me to endure at the beginning and then I liked it more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The environment was interesting, strange. but interesting The story had gaps / jumps that I think arouse a little public. There is not a great soundtrack in the background, creating the "romantic" atmosphere. BUT all did not matter. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite. There was an inexplicable strange chemistry that I could not resist; I fell in love with him and here I am, writing this review. The subtle description of love of the two actors was excellent, and I think that is the core of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a daily romantic comedy; In fact, not everyone will appreciate it. I had to sit down for a while and then, slowly, I began to understand the little things I did not grasp at first. I can not guarantee that everyone likes it, but I hope that YOU do.
