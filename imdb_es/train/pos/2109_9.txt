['I&#39;ve spent several times watching this since I realized it was a silly, sappy and dated romantic comedy. Well, it&#39;s a romantic comedy, and maybe a little outdated. However, it is not too sentimental, as it affects issues of office politics, adultery and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out as you expected. But, there is enough ingenuity and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you know someone who does not like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to meet her.']
