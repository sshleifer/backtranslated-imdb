I was very pleased to see a "Milanese" movie shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood correctly and, fortunately, in a film of Milanese philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a standard couple, in my Milanese career, that starts from "birth" to death. The wedding of birth is so typical of any scheme that it becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a story of how the couple met and fell in love. Life is hard in the "city" of Milan and, after the days of sweetness, the old days became harder and harder, and finally the product: a child, that instead of strengthening the relationship even more, It weakens because "the egoistic effect" is typical of today. "Metropolis" personality. The advertising environment with everything "creative" in a stressful environment helps to get involved well in the plot. We are losing the values ​​of life and this is well and deeply reflected in this beautiful and clear film by the director of Senza Pelle. <br /> <br /> The actors are well chosen, Stefania Rocca is nice and well characterized, and a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, known for the television series "trash": Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
