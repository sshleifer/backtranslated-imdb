['This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame of artists from around the world. The documentaries are varied and deal with all kinds of concepts, the only thing that is shared is the 11-S as a theme (very small in some cases). Some of the segments are weak, while others are very strong; Some are political, others not; some are only about September 11, others simply use September 11 as a theme to touch human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; Some are from the mainstream, while others are abstract and artistic. This movie has not been censored in any way by anyone, so the thoughts you see are very raw and powerful. <br /><br /> This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments can really annoy those on the right (one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber return as spirits, another from the United Kingdom that chronicles the overthrow of Chile backed by the United States on September 11, 1973 , which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrible atrocities). The segment of Mexico was the most powerful, relating the fall of the towers and the resulting death in a vivid way (you have to see it to believe it). <br /><br /> Even though the final product is uneven, with some segments that are almost &quot;useless&quot;, I still recommend it. It is very difficult to classify this film because the segments vary from one place to another (some weak, others very powerful). I give this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered topics that are generally censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).']
