Probably the best movie that Producers Releasing Corp has ever done, this little piece of horror attracts the attention of the first to the last. Director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and, more importantly, he knows how to realize his full impact potential on the screen. The plot not only involves and the characters are drawn in a fascinating way, but the stage is absolutely out of this world. Almost all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a sticky and penetrating fog. This chilling atmosphere is enhanced by the inventive direction of Wisbar and the totally convincing performances he has obtained from all his players. The lovely Rosemary La Planche is an ideal, beautiful, energetic but vulnerable heroine. Robert Barrat delivers his usual portrayal of local big shots, although it is hard to believe that the handsome, handsome man who plays his son is none other than the last writer / director of Dullsville Blake. Edwards.
