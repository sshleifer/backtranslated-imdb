Skip McCoy is a three times loser pick, unable to stop his instinct in the street, picks up Candy's bag in an underground train. What he does not realize is that Candy has a highly secret microfilm, a microfilm that is of great interest to many organizations. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller has created an exceptional drama among the sordid underworld of New York. City. Communist spies and shadowy government agents combine to make Pickup On South Street a fascinating vision from the first minute to the last. Based on a story by Dwight Taylor called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller excited this adaptation with a rather complicated political agenda, something that many at that time felt was over, but that only focusing on his anti-Communist inclinations is doing him a great bad service . /> <br /> Digging a little deeper and finding characters as intriguing as those that Fuller has directed, the main protagonist of one is the hero of the piece, a thief and a superficial human being, his heroines are not born of love for their country, they are born of their pure and stubborn streak. It's a great achievement that Fuller created one of the best anti-heroes of the 50s, and I'm sure he was very grateful for the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy, all with his cold and cold heart, his interaction with the wonderful Jean Peters . As Candy is excellent, and is the heart of the cinema. However, it is the Oscar-nominated Thelma Ritter who takes the honors of acting, her Moe is strong and as sordid as the characters that surround her, but Ritter conveys his majestic sense of weariness. <br /> <br /> It's a B textured film, but a running film, Pickup On South Street is a truly elegant and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9/10
