There is something in every "Hammer" movie that I see that really takes me to a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" movies, anything can happen. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one of those types of movies. He delves into occultism and hypnosis to bring a different kind of horror fantasy. In short, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
