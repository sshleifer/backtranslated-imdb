I'm surprised how this movie (and most of the others have an average of 5 stars and less when there are bad quality movies with an average of 7 to 10 stars in IMDb.) The fanboy mentality attacks again. Almost everyone criticized it, even my ex-girlfriend said that this movie was questionable, some years later I sat down to watch it and had fun, even laughing a little, This and The Replacements are the movies in which people labeled director Antoine Fuqua like the black Michael Bay ... I do not see how, since most of Fuqua's films are smarter than anything else that Michael Bay has come up with ... In any case ... <br /> <br / > History: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is the ex-convict who is used by a senseless Treasury agent Edgar (David Morse) as a pawn to catch a murderer named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson) All Alvin's movements are followed for an in secto implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents chase Bristol, Bristol is behind the bricks of gold that were taken in a robbery that went wrong. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is as fun as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a quick talker who is much smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is fine as Bristol. It can be exaggerated at times in his attitude of John Malkovitchesque. He was better here than Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard-edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny like Alvin's brother, Stevie. Both he and Jamie had some fun moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only flaw of the movie is that some of the attempts of a thriller fell. The scenario on the horse racing track is very exaggerated, but I could not look away. The director went out of his way to get points for that. In addition, the scene of the bomb with the treasure agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests at the door was quite ingenious. <br /> <br /> In general, Bait is not a bad movie. It's never boring, it's always fun and it did not check my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underestimated films of the 2000 period. <br /> <br /> PS: for the critic who claimed that this film is too violent ... How long have you been living under a rock? I'm pretty sure you've seen the Die Hard series and EVERY Quentin Tarantino movie. But those movies are not violent, right? Weirdo.
