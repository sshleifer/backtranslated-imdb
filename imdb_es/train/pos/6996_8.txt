This movie was really a great movie about something that affects us all. I know that I have personally encountered this many times. Thank God, Will Smith has jumped to the social issue of texting while driving. People, do not do it. One hour and forty-five minutes is not enough for this cause. Personally, I wanted to throw my cell phone after the movie. I was glad to see that other people in the theater saw the message and left their phones with empty bags of popcorn. I decided to turn off all text messages on my phone and recommend others to do the same. If you care about your family, have them see this vital public service announcement in text messages while driving or they could kill seven people. Thanks for showing us the way.
