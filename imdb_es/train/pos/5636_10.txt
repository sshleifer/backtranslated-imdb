In "Brave New Girl," Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings "The Yellow Rose of Texas" at a local competition and is admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia. From there, the film becomes a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I really liked that movie. It was full of great songs and performances and characters that kept it moving at a very pleasant pace. The performance was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding, as was Nick Roth. The work with the camera was done very well and I was very satisfied with the ending (it seems that there could be a sequel). Congratulations to the director and everyone else who participated in this production. All a jewel in the movie archives.
