Q.E.D. It was a brilliant television series and it really was one of the few programs that is worth programming. I suspect that in this era of TIVO and recording devices, it would be much better than in 1982. I am eagerly waiting for its availability on DVD! <br /> <br /> While it's true that it has something in common with other TV shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., of which I'm a big fan of QED . It had a much more intellectual quality. He did not suffer for that, however, the dialogue was ingenious and the action was high. The program was made in the UK as Mastermind, and had some of the BBC feel, but with better production values ​​than the BBC had at that time. <br /> <br /> I was nineteen years old when this series was first published and I had a lot to do in my life to make time for television. However, I remember my dear mother and she called me to remind me that Q.E.D. It was on, and we sat on the phone and saw it together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> In truth, Q.E.D. It is a sad loss and, if it could be done with the same quality and values ​​of today, I would love to see how it returns.
