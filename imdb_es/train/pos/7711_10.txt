Okay, Robbie looks nasty by today's standards, and part of the acting is pretty forced, and most of the special effects can now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old with a computer editing program decent. And do not make me talk about the poster. <br /> <br /> STILL a great movie, 40 years after its release. I grew up watching "science fiction" in the "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" of the local television station on Sunday afternoons, so I've seen quite a few science fiction movies from the 50s. At a time when most of the movies they were content with sticking a rubber costume on someone and demolishing it in a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet always raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie that really had an argument. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many of the SF movies made in the 90s are still considered worth seeing in 2030.
