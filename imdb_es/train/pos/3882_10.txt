I saw this tape, I rewound it immediately, I saw it again and I laughed twice. I highly recommend this tape for those who do not hate, but feel uncomfortable with transvestites. It shows you that transvestism is a characteristic, instead of the totality of your being. Comedy is not a unique subject. This man is brilliant. All comics should aspire to their level of openness, intelligence and talent.
