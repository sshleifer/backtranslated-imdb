After the success of Die Hard and its aftermath, it's no wonder that in the 1990s, a lot of 'Die Hard on a .....' movies charged money for the wrong guy, the wrong place, the concept of the wrong moment. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' in Stallone's career. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one of the big dreams of detractors, especially for those who are experts in mountaineering, base jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. In general, it is full of excuses to dismiss the film as an exaggerated pile of garbage. Stallone even managed to be overtaken by a horse! However, if you forget all the nonsense, it is really a very friendly and undeniably entertaining romp that offers many emotions and, unintentionally, a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> You have to love John Lithgows with contempt. evil, his tick in every square of the bad guys, and best of all, the agent of "shelter", permanently harassed and helpless, Rex Linn as Travers. <br /> <br /> It may have been Henry in 'Portrait of a serial killer' but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a performance as valuable as Hal, insists on screaming constantly with a painful disbelief at his captors "that the man never hurt anyone "And although it can not be, it really looks like the Frank of Ralph Waite the character smiles as the girl plummets to his death. <br /> <br /> Mention must also address the former actor of ' London's Burning ', Craig Fairbrass, as the bad guy in the UK, who is a trimmer while using Hal as a Human Football, yes, you can not stop enjoying that part, Hal needed a good kick. <br /> <br /> So forget your best judgment, who cares if "that could never happen", reduce your performance expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! And if you are looking for Qaulen, he is the one who carries the helicopter.
