['Although I was born in the year that this movie came out and I had never heard of it until my first year of high school (1996), when I saw it, I was totally absorbed in laughing, crying and feeling with the characters because I and my friends were they <br /><br /> Her hair, clothes and speech were outdated, but the emotions and desperation of each situation were so familiar! I remember thinking about how real he was and how he wanted them to continue making movies like that. <br /><br /> In fact, I saw this movie the night after having been at a crazy party (not unlike Jay&#39;s house) that crashed so we considered the lost losers who were on the edge of our crowd. A BS&#39;er world-class guy and a &quot;responsible&quot; mother figure who immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also the one with a car), although I also had a bit of Madge&#39;s insecurities floating around. My best friend was Deidre and her good friend since childhood was our Annie. <br /><br /> Watching the scene when Jeanie is in school or where she and her boyfriend separate and then tells Madge how much she loved him, it felt like conversations and situations that I had personally had. <br /><br /> Now, at the age of 27, I saw the film again and I felt a surge of emotions because it was like looking at a piece of my own youth (although none of my friends died). I think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up.']
