['I just finished watching this movie maybe for the seventh or eighth time, I picked it up a night previously seen in Blockbuster and I loved it, I&#39;ve shown it to 4 people so far and they have also enjoyed it. Avoiding all the glamor of Hollywood, special effects and stress in the &quot;shock factor&quot;, this independent film by Paul F. Ryan hits the nail on the head when dealing with the side effects of traumatic situations. Taking place after a shooting in high school, two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form an unlikely bond. Alicia, the girl with the heart of stone, the Gothic who has a pessimistic attitude towards life, helps Deanna overcome the problems of life and death, and live after all. Meanwhile, Deanna tries to help Alicia to see again some of the softness and light in the world. It is not stressful in the shocking event of the shooting, but in the interpersonal relationships between those who survived, what distinguishes this film. Despite its low budget and its short filming time, this film is far from being corny. Ryan respects a situation he has never endured and tries to delve into the human psyche. With an incredible actress, Philipps, she adds the necessary drama to the dialogue and the general feeling of the film, and Christensen helps to balance the feeling of &quot;pessimism&quot; that this film can have. In general, I recommend this film and if you like the subject of aggression and violence in school and learn more about it, I also suggest the documentary &quot;It&#39;s a world of girls&quot; published by CBC in 2004, which deals with the issue of bullying Social. comparing and contrasting two groups of girls, one in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of Dawn Marie Wellesley, a 14-year-old girl who committed suicide after being brutally harassed.']
