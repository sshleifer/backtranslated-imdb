The story of old Jane seems very popular these days. I have lost count of the number of available versions. Probably the reason is that your "routines" are our "routines" even at this late date. This television miniseries gives an educated form suitable for the novel. Thinking about it, Emma is a pretty "modern" girl when you think about it, although the atmosphere of Jane Austen's world may seem a bit artificial for us today. If it does not look like EMMA, I'll just say that self-sufficient Emma gets her comeuppance. It is worth looking to know how. The honors that act here go to the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They could almost have had a psychic connection with old Jane!
