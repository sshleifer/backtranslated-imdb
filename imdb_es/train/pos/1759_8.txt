I'm not sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, I'm not even sure if this can be applied. In recent years, movie theaters have been filled with comedy movies that are too stupid to make us smile. Therefore, I considered films that do not meet these requirements as "serious comedies." <br /> <br /> Does The 40 Year Old Virgin fit into this guild? That depends on you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. You have the opportunity to laugh a lot, besides offering a social commentary through some really cool characters and situations. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty, there's more than a 40-year-old virgin, and even people who do not exactly fit these specifications, you may feel identified by one of the characters in the film, especially the ones mens. <br /> <br /> The story, as the title says, is about Andy, a shy and silent guy, whom he collects action figures, watches Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia. <br /> <br /> Kal is Andy's co-worker at SmartTech. He believes that Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert, but he seems to get what he wants with the opposite gender. <br /> <br /> David is the passionate boy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, who ran away with another man. . And Jay, a man in a relationship that seems to be affected by his continuous acts of cheating and capture. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that most of the young people from 13 to 21 years old have already seen this movie, but it really has no age limit to be able to enjoy it. So, in case you have not seen it and enjoy a bit of laughter, with social commentary, go to your video store and take a break from those deep and depressing independent films. <br /> <br /> It also includes bonuses on DVD that you'll really see from top to bottom.
