This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think about all the choices I made and how I would change my life if my choices had been different. It is directly inscribed in the theory of the "multiple universe". <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not sound true is that Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has a hard time understanding what is happening, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
