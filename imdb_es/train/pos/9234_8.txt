This disturbing, violent and shocking epic story, based on real historical facts, maintains the viewer's interest by creating a verisimilitude that is lacking in most films set in a remote era. The Bolkan representation of the rebel nun is a tour de force. His gradual transformation into the character of an obedient, if not an accomplice, in the social injustices of his time, is skillfully demonstrated by counting sequences: his testimony of the hated activity of the local duke's casual rapist, his forbidden love relationship with a Jewish, his criminal desertion to the Muslim invader. forces of the sensual Prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) In this film there are some realistic bloody sequences (human skinners) that are not for the apprehensive, but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find great interest. It deserves to be seen, even if only as an antidote to the Hollywood representations of the medieval world.
