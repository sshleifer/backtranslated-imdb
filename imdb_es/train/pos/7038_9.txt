"The first war to be 100% subcontracted." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. This is a film difficult to describe; Comedy, satire, action, screwball. He recalled Dr. Strangelove once or twice, especially in the scenes with Ben Kingsley (I think he did an extraordinary job). I had no particular expectation of this movie, although I'm a big fan of John Cusack, so I just let the movie flood me. And as a result I entertained a lot. Political satire is painfully precise and quite condemnatory of the military-business complex of the United States. The subplots were somewhat predictable, but the final intertwining of the story lines made them worthwhile. I can understand why this movie was not very popular in the United States, but for the rest of the world it is a timely story.
