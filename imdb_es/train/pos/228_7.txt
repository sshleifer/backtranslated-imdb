"Convicts" is very much a kind of third act. All the interaction between the dialogue and the character that occurs within it comes from the prolonged recovery of a day in the south. And, by extension, the life of its main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of the director Peter Masterson and the writer Horton Foote. Six years earlier, they worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful," a movie that seems almost full of action compared to this one. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he's just the right side. The slow pace leaves a lot of space for the photographer Toyomichi Kurita, who infuses the film with the right sense of fragile light and warmth. <br /> <br /> Because this is essentially a filmed work, with little content. Editing or dexterity management, everything is about acting. As far as I'm concerned, there are no flaws here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are totally real, with no interest in anything other than life. Lukas Haas, a young actor with whom he was familiar in "Testamento" and "Witness", plays a character very similar to his other first roles. He is calm, withdrawn, somewhat scared and sad, somehow. These are qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> Maybe a title like "Damned" is a damage to this movie. That title, along with the opening scene, seems to create an image of a much more tied western type image. If the slow-paced theatrical productions do not interest you too much, you will also want to convey this. Otherwise, this could be exactly the movie you want to do more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
