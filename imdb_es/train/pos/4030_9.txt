This movie was absolutely wonderful. The time and culture prior to the partition have been beautifully recreated. Urmila has given another brilliant performance. What I really admire about this movie is that it does not resort to attacks against Pakistan that are spreading in movies like Gadar and LOC. With the partition as a backdrop, the film does not deviate from political issues or focus on violence or what is right or wrong. The film always focuses on the tragic history of Urmila's life. His fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been excellently represented. The film really shows how people, both Hindus and Muslims, have suffered this partition. The theme that there is only one religion prevails in this movie.
