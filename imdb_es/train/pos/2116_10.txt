Has there ever been a more charming movie than this one? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that the group of actors really seems to interact and have an effect on the lives of others. The center of this is the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can not get along well face to face, but who connect completely anonymously as pen pals. But there are also support characters and, unlike many romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail", the recent "Shop" update), not only do they take advantage to support the two potential customers and their needs. Everyone becomes an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm. One of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema takes place when the almost tragic Frank Morgan casually and humbly looks for someone to dine at Christmas. You must see it! **** outside ****
