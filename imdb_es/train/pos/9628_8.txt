['Some of my favorite films by Laurel and Hardy have very, very little plot. Instead, they are given a rather mundane situation and just let them be fun! Movies like HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the funniest when you see guys working or cleaning houses. Here in DIRTY WORK, most of the film is similar to these other two films: Stan and Ollie are swept out of chimneys and spend most of the film trying (unsuccessfully) to clean the chimney of a mad professor. Seeing Ollie fall through the fireplace, the guys who make the house a total mess and Stanley&#39;s foolish behaviors work together to make a very nice movie. <br /><br /> However, in a strange twist, there is also a really bizarre subplot that starts and ends the movie. It seems that the teacher is really a mad scientist and is working on a formula to make things younger. At the end of the movie, you see him do a duck on a duckling and even a duckling on an egg! Since he then leaves the children alone in the room, is it any wonder that it happens next? While this secondary plot was unnecessary, it worked well enough. What worked exceptionally well was the middle part. Do not give the children anything exciting to do and you will be surprised at the fun results. One of the best films of the team and almost wins a 9.']
