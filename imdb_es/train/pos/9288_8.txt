I discovered that this is a surprisingly light touch in a cultural shock movie of the 1950s. John Wayne would hardly be his first choice as a cultural attach√©, being as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bullfight in Harrods. But this time he was allowed to play a role that was much more passive than his usual bluff character, and he fulfilled his task with style. The duke was a guy who could really act well. Your facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite his considerable presence as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to master this movie. Many of your good intentions came to harvest. He had no authority over anyone, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom the barbarian belonged. <br /> <br /> The story of the American attempts to win the favor of an isolationist Japan was one of political intrigue instead of Swashbuckling or hell for leather battles. I can not comment on the accuracy of his research, but the strangeness of Eastern culture for Western sensibilities was well demonstrated. There were a lot of carefully choreographed ceremonies that implied what made this observer look like an authentic costume and accessories. The sets were complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought had been applied. <br /> <br /> The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added a small extra element, and prevented the film from becoming a political effort or waving a flag. The script was good without being too verbose. There was a lot of Japanese dialogue, but the long periods of translation did not interfere with the narrative. It was nice to see a lot of genuine orientals on set. If they were Japanese or not, I could not say it. But the part was visible anyway. At least, the Caucasians did not play with the protagonists, unlike other efforts like 'Blood Alley' (yes, I know they were Chinese) 'The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness' or even 'The King And I'. <Br /> <br /> Frankly, I enjoyed this more than any of those other movies. The script was better to start with. I never liked the songs of 'The King And I', and I was not impressed by the anti-communist subtext of 'Blood Alley'. I confess that I had never seen this work before and found it in comparison with many of The Duke's most popular outings. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
