A friend of mine recommended this movie, citing my vocal and inflexible similarities with Des Howl, the main character in the film. I suppose, to a certain extent, I can see that and maybe a little more, I'm not really sure if that's a flattering portrait. <br /> <br /> This is a quite unique work, the only movie in which this could have more than a simple similarity would be True Romance, not because of the content or the filming style or the rhythm of the dialogue (Whale Music is much more, well, relaxed). But instead, both represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general, I am a big fan of Canadian films about music and musicians (for example, I highly recommend the Hard Core logo) and this particular movie. He has an innocent charm, Des is not always the nicest guy, but there's something in him that attracts a kind of empathy.
