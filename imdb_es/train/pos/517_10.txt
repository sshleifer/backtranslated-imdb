Pressburger and the best movie of Powell. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot who loses his own death, but is given a second chance at life when the sky realizes that he is absent without permission and sends an angel to investigate. The scene in which young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all dead in action, come to heaven to be processed for eternal life is unbearably moving. Be careful also with Roger Livesey, a very unappreciated actor, and with Kim Hunter as the love interest (later, of course, Zira in Planet of the Apes). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg chose the actress who played the lead angel (Kathleen Byron) as the old private wife of the same name in Saving Private Ryan half a century later, an act that speaks volumes about his cinematic literacy.
