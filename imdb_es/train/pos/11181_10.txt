This is one of the most frightening, terrifying and heart-rending horror films of all! <br /> <br /> Dr. Creed (Louise) and his family move into a new home with his wife (Rachel), his daughter (Ellie) and their little son (Gage). Everything seems normal until Dr. Creed loses a patient he had. a terrible head injury. Then, the ghost pursues him when Victor takes him to Pet Sematarty and shows him where the dead come to life. <br /> <br /> Louis does not know if that was all a dream and is talking to Ellie, who cared about his cat who could be killed by a truck and then Rachel tells Louis that it is very difficult to talk about the death due to her sister Zelda who was really sick (as we see in a flashback, how sick her sister is. It really was and this is one of the most spooky scenes in history!) <br /> <br /> The next day , Louis receives a call from Jed that says the cat was killed by a truck and Jed takes it to the place where Victor the Ghost told him. Do not leave! And to bury the cat, his wife and their children have gone to see their grandparents and Louise is alone at home, surprised to see that the cat has returned and now it is so bad in her eyes that she goes to see Jed, then Jed tells her He says that he also buried his dog there too (as we have seen in another flashback). <br /> <br /> Later in the movie The family that has Picnic, Gage is playing with the kite and Gage says "I drop it", The wind blows the stick near the road where a truck passes by. the fast past, Gage approaches the road, Louis rushes to look for it, the most HEARTBREAKING scene of any horror movie will come out with his jaw on the floor or Shivers will go down his back when he hears Louis' screams, Soon he missed him so much that Louis buries Gage in the same place where the Cat is buried. <br /> <br /> The scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes from this movie are not very far from real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is just amazing and everyone's performance was great! 10 out of 10
