Gurinda Chada's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a gentle and moving comedy set in an ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London. <br /> <br /> As well as the passenger planes that constantly arrive and leave the rooftops, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) while they build a little friendship Probably focusing on their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with David Beckham. <br /> <br /> Much of the comedy stems from the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls, as they break all the expectations and conventions of their different family backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the middle, as an intermediary, Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers), team coach of the Hounslow Harriers, intervenes in times of crisis and remains the main object of affection of the two characters main. <br /> <br /> Eventually, and not without many obstacles and triumphs along the way, we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines rising to realize their dreams. <br /> <br /> With great performances by Bollywood veteran Anupam Kher (Mr. Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs. Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Mrs. Paxton) and Frank Harper (Mr. Paxton) this is really a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic boundaries. <br /> <br /> Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are struggling with their own struggles, but nevertheless they contribute enormously to our understanding of the film's main characters. <br /> <br /> In its own special form, this film tells an important story that, in quite a bit of incidental football.
