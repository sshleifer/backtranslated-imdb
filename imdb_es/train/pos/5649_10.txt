I'm watching the series again now that it's on DVD (yay!) It seems so new to me, as relevant and as intriguing as when it was first broadcast. <br /> <br /> The central performances are fascinating, the scripts will be placed in layers. <br /> <br /> I'll take my neck out and put it there with The Prisoner as a show that will win new fans and that will still be seen in 2035. <br /> <br /> I've been asked to write a line more (it seems that IMDb is an unfriendly user and analyzed retentively as always! Pithy and to the point is clearly not the form of IMDb). <br /> <br /> Well, unlike Editors of IMDb presentations, American Gothic understands that simplicity is everything. <br /> <br /> In 22 episodes, the program covers more character development than many programs in seven seasons. In addition to that, he questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way that challenges the viewer at all times to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation. <br /> <br /> When the show The first time the air was aired, I was still suffering from Twin Peaks and thought it would be a cheap imitation. Personally, I'm starting to rate it higher and I suspect it will get better over the years. Think that there is no more controversy than that!
