Although I can understand the bad things that someone has to say about this movie, I still found it absolutely incredible. It will touch you, and unless you are a critic who investigates the faults and setbacks of each movie, or who simply does not touch you, it is worth seeing. Do not enter the movie waiting for anything, just have a box of tissues and an open mind. It is beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think that Will Smith, although he once again plays another depressed and lonely person, is incredible. I think that a good actor is someone who can really represent the feelings and emotions that we all have in our worst / best experiences in such a way that it reaches you and makes you feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give me a chance.
