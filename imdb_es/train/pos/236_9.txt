It's a rare occasion when I want to watch a movie again. "The Amati Girls" is a movie of this kind. In the old movie theaters I would have stayed for more screenings. Was this autobiographical story for the writer / director? It has the aura of reality. <br /> <br /> The cast of all the stars presents its characters in a credible and tender way. Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl as an older sister? I have loved his work since "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> With most films, the belief is suspended because we know it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was difficult to suspend such belief in "The Amati Girls." You feel part of this family! How I wanted to come out in defense of Dolores when her family is repressing her emotional life. And I wanted to encourage Lee Grant while she rates criticism of Cloris Leachman's hair color. Humor everywhere is not laughter humor, but has a quality of well-being that satisfies much more than faults and so on. <br /> <br /> The love that is represented in this film family should be emulated and appreciated. <br /> <br /> It is not a coincidence that the surname, Amati, translated from Italian means "loved ones".
