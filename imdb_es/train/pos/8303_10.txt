This movie literally has all the clich√©s of each action movie and they all work in their favor. Directly from Lethal Weapon, Gary Busey makes a joke, shoots and laughs through this movie with such reckless abandon that he can not stop entertaining and entertaining. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream trucks, and if there are not enough reasons to see this movie, how about the best ... Danny Trejo? And if you do not know who Danny Trejo is, you probably do not like this movie.
