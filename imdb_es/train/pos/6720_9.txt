Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and acclaimed surf movies, Endless Summer by Dana Brown, his follow-up Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son, and Step in liquid (IMAX). I saw the first, not the rest. <br /> <br /> While the surf images are spectacular, I valued the historical perspective of most of the filmmakers. It goes back to the origins of the sport almost one hundred years ago and shows how it evolved to its current form. This includes extensive interviews with prominent personalities and artists, how surfboard designs changed over time, what beaches in Hawaii and California were the most frequented by world-class surfers, and what incredible adrenaline the sport provided them with. The athletes lived for months on the beaches, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped in rudimentary bunks, looked for food and returned to their tables the next day. What a euphoric way to spend your days of youth. <br /> <br /> We see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest boost to the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, although I suspect that copyright issues may prevent Beachboys surfing songs like Surfer Girl and Surfing USA from being credited. Surfing magazine and Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew there was such a volume) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from sports pioneers, their families and how the current generation benefited from the creators in the sixties. One of those stories is how Laird Hamilton, 40, considered the best surfer of today, linked to a previous surfer leader, introduced him to his single mother, whom he married before becoming his stepfather. <br /> <br /> A musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story. Have I opened your appetite? Wonderful. Have a good walk.
