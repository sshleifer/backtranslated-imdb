Walking home after the movie, I was humming the family waltz music with which Natalia and Alexandre danced. I've heard that before, where? Oh, from Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (track 2), I got it right when I got to the door. It is "Waltz No. 2 of Jazz Suite No. 2" composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, played here by the Philharmonic Orchestra of the City of Prague. Yes, I went and picked up the Tower soundtrack. What a luxury! The score of Alexandre Desplat's film was satisfactory: there are fifteen tracks, plus two tracks of the valuable waltz. It is not often that these days we have a soundtrack dedicated entirely to a full movie. It reminds me of the favorite scores of Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (the opening notes of track 6 have traces of "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue and John Barry. There are subtle nuances of tensions and notes of the strings, celestial, piano and harp. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro had a matched performance that consumed credibly. The love story, its intimate connection, is very similar to that of Alexandre and Natalia, her childish but tormenting inner world, and her generous and daring understanding of him, a relationship for both. The director Marleen Gorris of "Antonia's Line" (Best foreign language film of the Academy Awards of the Netherlands) gave us a discreetly sensitive film, not without its disturbing human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family efforts, love and respect . The front-end theme is the mental game and the mathematical logic of chess. Below there may be a slight tear of a drama set in the 1920s. The photograph captures the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy, near the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> I recommend the soundtrack if you do not feel like going to the movies. The lyrical score by Alexandre Desplat from "The Luzhin Defense" is complete.
