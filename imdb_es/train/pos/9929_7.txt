I doubt that much of this movie is based on a true story. At first he says it based on a real story, more or less. I bet the only truth was that there was an ex-model turned into bounty hunter possibly called Domino. <br /> <br /> Anyway, start with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is being questioned about what she knows about a $ 10 million theft. Through the flashbacks, we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter. Basically, she tells 2 other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. It is hard, you can use any type of weapon and will use your good looks if necessary. <br /> <br /> They get involved with a scam that Clarmont, a jailer, is gone. Along the way, the group starts a reality TV show, and that's where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green get involved. They are something like hosts and they must have been really desperate to appear in this. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was entertaining and that I had some laughs. The edition did not bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mainly with weapons and blood. It could have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Good enough to see it.
