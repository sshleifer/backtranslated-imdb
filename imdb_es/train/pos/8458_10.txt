['Gundam Wing is an incredible show from beginning to end, each episode is a pleasure to watch. History is the typical rate of Gundam, in the future the populations of the Earth grow to the point where we create space colonies to expand. However, the story is set in a completely different reality than any other Gundam show. It is the year after Colony 195 and the corrupt government of the Earth, known as the Earth Sphere Alliance, is violently taking over the free colonies. To combat the control of the Alliance and the next major threat (an evil militarist organization that hides within the Alliance known as OZ, which later takes control of the Earth and the colonies), select members of the colonies They send 5 super powerful mechs to Earth to try to save the colonies from the threat that will come soon. These mechs, known as Gundams, fight against OZ and try to regain peace in the colonies while OZ takes the foreground, completely eliminating the Alliance and taking control of the Earth and its colonies. <br /><br /> Gundam Wing, as I said before, is probably the most fun Gundam series to see in my opinion. A big part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other previous Gundam series, but also the stories are much deeper and more intricate than most other Gundam series. Gundam Wing has more depth and emotion than any other Gundam program I&#39;ve seen so far. This particular series seemed to focus more on the character and relationships between those characters than on the epic space battle. Now, do not get me wrong, this program still has many epic battles in it, and the program still maintains the epic atmosphere that other Gundam series have, but achieves this by making the story follow a set of 6 or 7 characters like Against follow only 1. <br /><br /> No matter how you see it, this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable Gundam series out there, and I recommend it to any anime or general science fiction fan. The show shows amazing animation and excellent action, but the depth and complexity of the story is what makes you come back for more. The characters are so well drawn at the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them. This show is definitely one that should not be missed. <br /><br /> A perfect 10/10!']
