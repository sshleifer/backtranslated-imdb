['&quot;Pickup On South Street&quot; is a high-speed drama about a petty criminal who suddenly finds himself involved in the activities of a group of communists. The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style, and the momentum is maintained through a brilliant edition. The use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close-ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant movement and vitality. The style of direction of Samuel Fuller and the cinematography of Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes that through their composition and lighting produce a great sense of humor and atmosphere. <br /><br /> To the pickpocket and backslider, the offender Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named Candy (Jean Peters) in the New York subway. She was being used by her ex-boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley) to make a delivery to one of her contacts in a communist organization and, for her, she did not know the secrets of the US government. UU Recorded on microfilm. Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the robbery. One of the agents follows her back to Joey&#39;s apartment and the other, Zara (Willis Bouchey), visits Police Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye). Zara explains that the FBI has been following Candy for some months as part of her search for the leader of a communist group. <br /><br /> To identify the pickpocket, Tiger calls a &quot;stoolie&quot; named Moe (Thelma Ritter), who after receiving an accurate description of the working method of the &quot;cannon&quot; makes a list of eight possible suspects. Once Tiger sees Skip&#39;s name on the list, he immediately convinces himself that he is the man they need to track down and sends two detectives to arrest him. When Skip is taken to Tiger&#39;s office, Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger offers to withdraw any charges if he will cooperate with the investigation. Skip is frivolous and arrogant. He clearly does not trust Tiger and denies any knowledge of theft in the subway. <br /><br /> Joey orders Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieves it. Candy pays Moe for Skip&#39;s address and when Skip returns from being questioned by Tiger, he finds Candy looking for her at home and knocks her out before stealing her money. When he recovers, Skip demands a payment of $ 25,000 for the microfilm. She tells Joey about Skip&#39;s demand and Joey&#39;s boss gives him a gun and orders him to retrieve the microfilm the next night. <br /><br /> Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it is because of their uneasy and developing relationship that a means is developed by which the attentions of the police can be shaken. However, it soon becomes clear that solving the problems with the communist gang will only be achieved through more direct action. <br /><br /> The portrayals of Skip, Candy and Moe as characters that live in a miserable world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and convincing. <br /><br /> Moe&#39;s job as a police informant depends on his knowledge of the people in his community, but also those people know what he does and any of them can seek his revenge at any time. She seems to be cunning and streetwise, but she also has her vulnerable side, as she describes herself as &quot;an old clock that is running out&quot; and saves money to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery on Long Island. Her belief that &quot;each dollar has a meaning of its own&quot; leads her to sell any information regardless of danger, friendships or principles, and yet there is a time when she refuses and this is fatal. The performance of Thelma Ritter certainly deserved the Oscar nomination she won for her role. <br /><br /> Skip is a violent criminal who does not care about his victims and who has already been convicted three times in the past, lives under the constant threat of being imprisoned for life if he is convicted again. Despite this, she still continues with her criminal activities and, strangely enough, is merely philosophical when Moe reveals her whereabouts and later even makes sure that Moe receives the type of burial she valued so much. Candy is a former prostitute and someone whose activities put her constantly in danger, but behind her hardened exterior, a warmer side gradually becomes more evident. Widmark and Peters are perfect for their roles and, like Ritter, they represent the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction.']
