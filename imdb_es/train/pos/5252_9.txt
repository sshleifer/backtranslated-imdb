When I found out about this movie, it was supposed to be the funniest thing I had seen, yes, it was funny. I mean, I liked everything until the end, where ........... No, I can not tell you if you should do it for yourself. It's funny except. The vulgar language. That's why I say that if you like movies that are fun in sexual terms, see them, but if not, do not waste time to rent them or buy them.
