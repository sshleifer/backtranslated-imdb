['What happens when the average Joe discovers he has supernatural powers? The premise may sound familiar. The watchers? Unbreakable? However, the Russian science fiction action movie, The Sword Bearer, is far from the standard action. <br /><br /> The story revolves around a man named Sasha who as a child was rejected by society, his companions and his family due to a supernatural power he possesses. When he wishes or his anger allows it, a sword extends from his arm and pierces his own skin. Very wolverinish? Maybe ... but that&#39;s not the interesting part of this movie. Rejected all his life and driven by anger (and a genius he has) our &quot;hero&quot; returns to his hometown to change his life or find a reason to do so. The only thing he finds here is a problem when an encounter with the new boyfriend of an old flame leaves him bloody on the floor. This is where revenge and anger come into play. This is a man who does not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on their tail. He meets a girl and falls instantly in love with her, and that&#39;s what the movie is about. <br /><br /> The film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and harmonics combined with short but extreme action sequences. This is the house of art in its essence, beautifully filmed with so much attention to detail in every scene about the frightening science fiction action. It&#39;s this strange mix that interests me so much in this movie. The directors&#39; approach to this genre is refreshing, focusing on Sasha&#39;s emotional journey and not on a direct action movie. But do not worry, the action is there and in abundance. However, many of these sequences only show implicit violence with images of the terrible consequences. This does not mean that the action is not shown. These scenes are here and they are fantastic (especially the ending where we see the full powers of Sasha unleashed in despair). The director chooses to involve the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the emotional struggle of the character at hand. This is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre.']
