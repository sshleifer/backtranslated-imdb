I just caught him at the Toronto International Film Festival. This is a good story, told in a convincing way. The focus of the handheld camera for the action scenes adds to the intensity of those scenes (in a documentary style, not in a Blair witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a big budget to produce an exciting film. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, in particular the actor who stars in the events of the film, Boz.
