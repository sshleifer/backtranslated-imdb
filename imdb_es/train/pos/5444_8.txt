Class Reunion is a very underestimated comedy gem. It's 1982 and the 1972 Lizzie Borden High class returns for a 10-year reunion, among which are the usual stereotypes, the hunk, the baby, the fat and the nerd, etc., but the alumni are passing a bumpy night, one of his classmates are Walter Baloer, the puppet of the class who was subjected to a comedy prank for the rest of the class on graduation night and has since been in a mental home, Walter escapes and now plans to take revenge for his humiliation. "<br /> Despite the dark premise, this is really just an excuse for many fun gags, saying a lot more would ruin the movie, but if you enjoyed the Naked movies Gun & Airplane, you'll love this, and what other film does Chuck Berry's musical cameo offer? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
