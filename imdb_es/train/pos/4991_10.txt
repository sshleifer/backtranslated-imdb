It's a pity that this movie is so hard to get in the United States. I found it through a distributor of rare videos, and it was certainly worth it. This is, without a doubt, the best film made during the pre-code era and the best film of the thirties. The master director Frank Borzage made wonderful films about the Depression, and with MAN'S CASTLE he created a fairy tale amidst the difficulties of the era. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them, and help make this movie a wonderful romance. Young's Trina is sweet and optimistic, while Tracy's Law is abrupt and closed. The dynamic between the characters creates one of the most difficult relationships, but at the end rewarding in the film. <br /> <br /> THE MAN'S CASTLE is the softest precoded movie I've seen. Borzage uses the nebulous and dreamy technique to turn the town of the squatters where Bill and Trina live in a palace. The difficulties of depression are never ignored, in fact, they are an integral part of the film. But as Borzage creates the film as a soft-focus fairy tale, love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh. It makes the film warm and loving. <br /> <br /> THE MAN'S CASTLE is the most important achievement of the pre-code era. If only more people could see it.
