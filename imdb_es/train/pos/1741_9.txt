This is a dramatic movie in every sense of the word. It shows that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Of course it has some extremes ... but from time to time the pain of real life surpasses art. It is profoundly critical of the objectives we pursue and of the social structure as a whole. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek life forms, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek movies that have a certain fast food audience, it is not directed at anyone in particular, but as you watch it, you feel someone is putting the best words and images possible to describe your feelings. Nor am I a big fan of traditional music, but I would not like to hear anything else when it was heard during the movie. <br /> <br /> If someone told me to say something against this movie, I would define it. The following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut. I suppose the edition had to cut it so that it would adjust to 2 hours and a bit for the theaters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could write more and more to express my thoughts on this, but I think you have to see it. and discuss it with a friend. You must see it
