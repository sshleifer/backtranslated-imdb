['Soylent Green I thought it was an excellent movie. <br /><br /> If you like Logan&#39;s Run you will like this. <br /><br /> Yes, the film is old and there are no special effects and some of the performances can best be described as &quot;corny&quot;, but the story is excellent. <br /><br /> The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very moving. <br /><br /> In the end, the mystery was not a mystery, but the story developed in an easy and correct rhythm. <br /><br /> Its closest modern equivalent would be &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in terms of how it is shown that the United States is a third world country.']
