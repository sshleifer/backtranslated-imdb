['As a former Okinawan Karate World Champion 2 times, I like movies about sacrifice for sport. But this movie is about much more. This movie is so good and so deep. Recently I have been plagued by very serious injuries and almost a disastrous lack of passion. Almost the lights go out for me. And this little silly movie moved me so much that, as of a daze, it reminded me of what life is supposed to be about. This is a movie about life. Live your life for yourself and respect others. Empowerment God, bless &quot;Double like Beckham&quot; I think it&#39;s a real gem.']
