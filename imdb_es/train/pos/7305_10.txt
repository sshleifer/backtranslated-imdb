['In 1978 a phenomenon began. The launching of &quot;Halloween&quot; by John Carpenter caused people to line up around the block to witness the evil that is Michael Meyers. The critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated and it has become one of the best movies in film history. <br /><br /> plot: 15 years after a murder was committed, four friends (all females) take care of the children (and they have it with their boyfriends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the night before, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to stalk these people. He murders 3 of them in silence and with subtlety. He does not speak. He walks slowly He hides ... <br /><br /> Only one of the friends escapes, after being saved by Doctor Loomis (Michael&#39;s persecutor and doctor) <br /><br /> There is a reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he kills and he scares us. They are the only reasons we are afraid. <br /><br /> John Carpenter wrote the film, and directed. He creates an unbearable tension throughout history, and it&#39;s so scary that sometimes we can not see it. And the climax is really amazing. <br /><br /> Like horror, this is essential. It is scary and well acted. It is also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human. A force that can not be denied. <br /><br /> The sequels focused too much around Michael and his &quot;story&quot;. This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe that&#39;s why this thing is a masterpiece.']
