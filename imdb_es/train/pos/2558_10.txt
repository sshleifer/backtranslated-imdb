I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We are still together. <br /> <br /> However, in the 1950s it would never have been so easy. <br /> <br /> Life in the army had been mined for action, drama and comedy for years by this point. Mined to death. Mixed relationships gave her new ground to cover. This is the old hat today, but then ...? Marrying an Asian man back then meant that you owed something to someone or that you were a weird guy. This touched both possibilities together with the third. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando did his usual good job. Garner did a better job than he usually does. He is good, but this proved how good he could be. Umecki-chan had a hellish debut here and although I think she won her statue, she did not really stretch. It was a role that nobody who had not been abroad would have recognized and the novelty was the contractor. <br /> <br /> The real scene thief was Red Buttons. Red was the best in this movie. Bank in it. And the Japanese lifestyles were also shown with an admirable light. <br /> <br /> A classic.
