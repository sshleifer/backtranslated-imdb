Here is the skinny one, it seems that this is much older than I thought it was. But it's still great. The bike machines are great and the story works for the most part. There are some character problems that I hope will be resolved by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all that appears to be an imitation of MACROSS. Not only the style of animation but several character designs. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY from MACROSS. The mechs resemble MACROSS as well as the other characters. This really is not made for young children, it has graphic violence, nudes and sexual graphic content. So to summarize the story, I give this great MACROSS 7 STARS.
