The events of September 11, 2001 overshadowed this ceremony of Oscar awards with a minute of silence before the assembly in memory and there was not much in the extravagance of comedy that everything sings all the dance that we expected from this. Award show, but this was by no means a bad thing. The entertainment was more or less reduced to a LOTR shipment with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson and that was it. The rest of the show was taken with clips from the nominations and I have to admit that it was actually nicer than the numbers of exaggerated songs and dances we've seen over the years and Whoopi Goldberg was not a bad presenter at all, Unlike the esoteric David Letterman of a few years ago and the silence of a minute for the victims of September 11 was disturbing and worthy. <br /> <br /> As for the prizes, New Zealand was absolutely stolen. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING went home with four minor prizes, while A BEAUTIFUL MindD took most of the big prizes, except for the best actor that should have gone to a tough New York guy, but in turn went to a totally American type. The only Oscar awards I accepted, apart from those presented at FELLOWSHIP, were the awards for best supporting actress and best supporting actor, both called correct.
