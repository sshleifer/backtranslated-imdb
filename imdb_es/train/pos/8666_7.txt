Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking mobster who surrenders to the police or illegal gambling (for reasons that do not seem clear to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thug who frequents a billiard room and spends his free time envying Frankie. Being in the right place at the right time, Tony is arrested with Frankie and sent to jail ... where they form a bond that may not be a friendship, but will do so for now. <br /> <br /> This movie came to me under the title of "Frank and Tony", which is disappointing because I see that an alternative name is "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony", which would have helped to sell the movie more effective I guess it's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry", but what do I know? I saw it shortly after another Italian crime movie, "Violent Professionals," and I must say that the two complement each other very well. <br /> <br /> Italians have always lagged behind the Americans in their budgets and production values, which is a real shame with this movie. It is considered a "grindhouse" movie, which turns it into a b-movie (or worse). With a clearer sound and image, this could have been a Hollywood hit, I suspect. The story seemed very interesting to me, the characters (and the actors) are better than the average and, unlike "Violent Professionals", the plot is quite clear: there are not too many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like movies or Mafia crime Movies you should try this one. A movie about the mafia that actually comes from Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) It's all you can ask. Sure, it's not "The Godfather", but it's not supposed to be. This is not a drama, it's a light comedy, a heavy-duty fellow movie ... like "Die Hard With A Vengeance" from the point of view of the bad guys. Well, it's okay, not really. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, this movie made me want to see other films by the director and the main cast. Films in addition to "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and the usual cult movies. What is more fun than discovering a lost classic?
