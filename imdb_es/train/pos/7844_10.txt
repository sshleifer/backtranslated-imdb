I really love this program, it's like reading a book and each chapter leaves you wanting more. It makes you think about what will happen in the next episode and the struggle to try to maintain their friendship over the years. After each episode ends, he leaves a sweet bitter taste in his mouth knowing that: One: the show was good, he can not wait for the next episode and it really makes him think about what really happens to friends throughout the years. twenty years. And two: the fact that the program has been "paused" and we will not see the program finish in its entirety. Fox, obviously, does not know what they have done, they claim that they are losing spectators in the category 18 - 49 and clearly do not know what people want to see if they get rid of a good program like "Reunion". I have a question that I would like to raise. If they brought the program back and continued for another season, how would it work since each episode takes place over the period of one year and the story is based on what happens in the span of twenty years? Your answers are welcome. Bring back the meeting! Bring back the meeting!
