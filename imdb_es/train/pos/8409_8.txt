A good movie, and I'll see it several times. Rich (the previous commentator) is right: there is much more at stake here than what is clearly seen on the title boards, and I have to wonder how much the translation has suffered. Was there more in the original? Or was it expected that a native-language audience would read more? Or, since the script was written by the author of the novel on which it was based, was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? In short, it's worth taking a look, but it's likely to require more work from contemporary viewers than the original audience of 1913 had to put on. <br /> <br /> The launch of Alpha Video promotes the new score of organ, but the music is Does not match the progression of the story in any way. Of course, it begins in a promising way, but it degenerates into a repetitive monotony, similar to that of Phillip-Glass, which reflects nothing of the action on the screen. After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and just observed: much better!
