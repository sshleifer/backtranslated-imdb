I have seen this film for many years and I have searched for it ever since, in my opinion, although very crude, it is very educational in terms of what the future holds. I enjoyed the movie and this day, I rate all those who do not agree. but you should always judge a movie for each one and, in my opinion, it's great to try it with all the cloning babies and specimens that are happening today, who are we to judge this movie, this can be a dramatized event of what is . To become but you have to go. All the horrors of today are so far away that I even laugh, but this makes me think and I'm scared as a mother, and if I was desperate, after seeing this movie, I would think twice, I'm sorry, but I love the movie. do not watch the movie, just know the story and ask yourself how far would you go for a child?
