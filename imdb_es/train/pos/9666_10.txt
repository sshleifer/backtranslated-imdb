['Bette Midler is divine again! Ruscamente humoristic. In love with burlesque. Able to make you cry with old jokes with new dresses or simply with old songs with more power and punch than ever. All in All Singing new ballads, singing potentially good old / perennial as &quot;The Rose&quot;; &quot;Stay With Me&quot; and yes, even &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;. The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been liberation, since this is the best alternative, I strongly recommended everyone with a mixture of charm and appreciation with open eyes and the naughty desire of a child to overcome all the limits!']
