['Maybe I&#39;m being too generous with the rating ... but I love this movie! I&#39;ve seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I fall in love again. It&#39;s just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing huge or monumental that happens. But I am a great romantic and this movie is romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is very funny. Scientists make me laugh so much ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it. It&#39;s such a good and clean movie, and those are so rare now! My 20-year-old brother also likes this movie, so it&#39;s not just a movie for girls. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you are alone and you need * to see * a romance, if you yourself can not participate in one. It&#39;s a good &#39;a!']
