The German medieval saga of Fritz Lang continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge her murdered husband, Siegfried. His brother is too weak to take the murdered, Hagen, to justice. Kriemhild marries Etzel, the King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). She gives birth to a child and invites her brothers to a party. Etzel and the other Huns should kill Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers. We see a great battle of life. and death begins, and she burns the whole place. Usually, Hagen is dead, and so is Kriemhild. These films deal with great themes, such as revenge and eternal love. Surely later we have seen some better movies made of those themes, but this was one of the first.
