After reading Diamond's book, I was a little disappointed with the series, but in general, it's quite informative. When reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the "culture warriors" work hard, seeing "attacks" on the "western civilization" under each carpet. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a bit of a preacher? Of course. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing in history. He uses the phrase 'weapons, germs and steel' in seemingly every opportunity during the series. We got it, after the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a bit simplistic (in the series)? Of course. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly fun, condensing a very long and complicated story in "smallpox, swords and horses", which concludes the entire conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point is still valid: these things contributed in fact (but did not fully define) the reasons for the success of Spanish against established cultures. <br /> <br /> Do you preach * against * Western civilization in any way? Not a word. Not in my ear. All he says is that luck played an important role in determining which cultures moved faster, * not * that luck is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors that influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
