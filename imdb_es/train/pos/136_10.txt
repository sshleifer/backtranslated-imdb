This movie is a great way for the series to finally end. Peter (the Puppet Master III child) has grown and is now the Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn the secrets of Toulon, but instead listens to the story of the puppets. Most of this movie is material from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... But I guess Paramount would not allow them to use scenes from one). Personally, I want the Puppet Master vs. The demonic toys would finally be made, but the way this movie ends basically says "This is the final film of the series ..."
