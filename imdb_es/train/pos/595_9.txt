When John Wayne filmed his story of Alamo, he had built a complete Alamo game in the city of Brackettsville, Texas, which is still there and is a tourist attraction. As long as it is maintained, we will have a set for future interpretations of Alamo for the screen. One of these works with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was made in this century. <br /> <br /> But I would say The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory is the best filmed Alamo story I've ever seen. John Wayne's movie is good if it's overrated, but it's a John Wayne movie with the story remade to fill the parameters of John Wayne's screen character. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and gives an excellent interpretation of the character of the happy frontier he was. <br /> <br /> It's much closer to Professor Lon Tinkle's book on The Alamo than to Wayne's movie and I read the book's years. A moment ago I can witness that. Tinkle's book appears as the source in both films, but Tinkle, who was alive at the time when Wayne's film ended and was not satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was the right age for the young William Barrett Travis, the idealistic freedom fighter who, by the way, owned slaves. Back in the day nobody saw the ironic contradiction in that. One thing that was not explored and has not been was the hyperactive sexual desire of Travis. He was the Casanova of the Southwest, he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquests. <br /> <br /> But the man who always gets the wash is Jim Bowie, played here by James Arness. He was a hero at the Alamo, no doubt, but his career before the Alamo was that of a scoundrel. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, a swindler who sold lands to which he had questionable titles. But his heroic death certainly redeemed him. There is no hint of that in the Arness representation or in any other I've seen of Bowie on the screen. And, of course, he designed the Bowie knife, made to his specifications. That man needed such a weapon. <br /> <br /> However, The Alamo's main asset: Thirteen Days To Glory is a complete portrait of Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, the Mexican president who personally introduces himself to quell the rebellion provoked by the Americans who have come to settle in Texas by Mexican invitation. Unfortunately, those Americans came with some preconceived notions about freedom that simply had not come this far to the south, at least freedom for whites. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna, who remains an even more controversial figure in the history of Mexico. He was also quite the scoundrel, but it was the best Mexico produced until a true reformer named Benito Juarez appeared. <br /> <br /> This movie was the farewell to Lorne Greene, who appears briefly as General Sam Houston. Greene is not exactly my conception of Houston, I was really too old for the role, Houston was in his forties in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of Texas. But within the limits imposed on him, Greene does a good job. <br /> <br /> For a romantic narrative of the El √Ålamo story, see John Wayne's version, but for the historical content, I recommend this movie.
