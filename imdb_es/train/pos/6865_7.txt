With the current tendency of crude humor, this film is the grandmother of all of them. While part of the humor is dated, each sketch will scandalize, reject or make you laugh out loud. The most memorable is the comment of the sexual games and, of course, the VD commercial. It does not always work, but it's worth it when it does. I give this one a 7.
