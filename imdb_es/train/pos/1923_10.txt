8 Simple rules to go out with my teenage daughter had an auspicious beginning. The talented Tom Shadyac was involved in the project. This meant that the comedy would be nothing short of spectacular, and that was exactly what happened: the show remains one of the freshest, funniest and funniest of all time. Each line, facial expression, choice of cast, scene, everything deviated from perfection. There was not an episode after which I thought: "Man that was not as good as the rest". Each one was a standout. Once again, this is the kind of perfectionism we expect from Tom. For those who do not know, Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (first film), The Nutty Professor (first) and Liar Liar. All a summary. He is a producer here, not a director, but his magical touch is felt in each episode. The family consists of: <br /> <br /> The Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): nice, a little neurotic, it can be an assault. Occasionally, he works as a sports writer. Unfortunately, John died in 2003, leaving a loving memory and almost without contemplation of cancellation by the suits. <br /> <br /> Mother: Cate (Katey Sagal): Come on, who did not fall in love with Katey when Ella played Peg in Married With Children? Al Bundy was our hero. The spectators gave him the respect and love he never had. But without Peg's carefree, parasitic, lazy lifestyle, Al would probably have been just another Chicago father instead of the mess Peg (life, in fact) caused him to be. Katey was a MILF back then and still is: a brune now (instead of a redhead) and as buxom as ever. Cate is the conservative mother and loving wife. I know it sounds boring, but comically, she fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> The Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played to perfection by Kaley Cuoco): an idiot has almost never played so well. Apart from Gob in Arrested Development, Bridget can be a shoe for any award given to this archetype. Bridget is superficial, self-centered, not very bright and a little bitch in her appearance. She plays the role of silly blonde better than absolutely nobody IMO. Perfection. One of the highlights of the show. <br /> <br /> The overlooked geeky daughter: Kerry (Amy Davidson): a brune and a geek, does not receive love from life or circumstances. It feels overlooked, underestimated and neglected most of the time. She is Bridget's younger sister (actually she is older than her) and the extremely opposite personalities and brains of the two cause endless clashes, much to our amusement. <br /> <br /> The Son: Rory (Martin Spanjers): he was the second most funny character of the IMO before the death of Ritter, then John passes, new characters arrive and Rory is not the most used to do with the verbal problems: it used to be especially for the character of David Spade. <br /> <br /> Those characters were the main ones in the time of John Ritter. Unfortunately, the incredibly hilarious Larry Miller (one of my favorites) did not have much time on screen. He played Paul's workmate / competitor. After an aortic dissection cost Ritter his life in 2003 (September 11), the program was paused for a while. Nobody thought he could go back, but he did it later, with a couple of new additions. This began the second phase of the show, and the new characters were: <br /> <br /> The director of the strict and confident school: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam here and there on talk shows. This was the first time I saw him do something. Impressed, it's the word I use. His performance was very impressive. Sad was not brought before. He also interprets the possible love interest of Cate after Paul passes. The gradual progress towards this point (which would have seemed crazy at first) wins many praises for the creators. It was done slowly, carefully and excellently, with constant respect for Paul (Ritter). <br /> <br /> Granddaddy's Attitude: Jim Egan (James Garner): a surprisingly welcome addition to the series, it was a foraging cannon for a host of 'old' jokes, mainly because ... <br / > <br /> The half brother of the unemployed mom of 35 years, unemployed: CJ (played at incredibly funny levels of David Spade): I knew Spade was funny, I just did not know he was THAT funny. In some way, the very familiar presence of Spade is perceived within his character (as opposed to a separable character), which is understandable, since it is a comic and is in a comedy program. This strange feeling is something like watching someone borrow a lot of material from David Spade's appearances in movies, talk shows and features (awards, etc.) and deliver an excellent imitation of Spade's voice and comedy style, except that It's Spade. By that I mean you realize you're not trying to play another person, or a completely new character: it's being the silly and funny Spade we've come to know, and it takes this pleasantly humorous formula to the absolute top. Every line he uttered, every sarcasm he spawned, all the classics, literally. Spade was madly amused; so, SO funny. <br /> <br /> The program's humor and drama increased after the program returned, but the audience thought: "John passed, it will not be the same." This is understandable, considering that we are talking about a group of people (US viewers) who gave a free ride to 'Yes Dear', but they caused the cancellation of Andy Richter Controls the Universe in a very short time. As the quality of the program increased, its ratings decreased. Soon it was no more, sadly. <br /> <br /> And I saved the best for last: Married With Children fans are on a whim. And boy, what did I try? I still shudder just to remember it. It is a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it, even if I legitimately do so under the pretext of "spoiler ...". Suffice to say that it is something you will NEVER forget. I know I will not do it :-)
