['From the initial shots of the main actor, we are given an early view of how many lives of men are carried by women in them, and the humor that appears in everything that happens in the day to day life of &quot;normal&quot; . . <br /><br /> Eric Lartigau, the director, realizes how many European men feel that they have total control over their lives, but without the help / support of the women around them, things do not seem to work. The use of the facial image throughout the film is excellent, and its intelligent positioning of the older member of the family (mother) is perfect. <br /><br /> While there is more than enough laughter in the film, it is still about single parents / adoption and the strength of the family in society. Truly rewarding to see, and again that only French sewing is capable of doing. <br /><br /> So far, one of the best 50 movies I&#39;ve seen this year, and well worth a five-star rating. I hope to add this to the DVD collection when it is released and I recommend it to all ages.']
