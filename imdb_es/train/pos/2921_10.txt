The One and Only was a great movie. I had just finished watching it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought that this was a good representation of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now, this movie was made 4 years before I was born, but I do not think the rigors of professional wrestling trips have changed much. Sad, fun, and all great! **** 10+
