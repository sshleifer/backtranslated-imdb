As someone who never condescended to Adam Sandler in terms of talent, as it was done with him and with many comic actors like him, I entered Reign Over Me waiting for a great movie, not only because of his presence in the film but because I thought he looked very good in general. Even someone who already thought that Sandler could offer an effective dramatic performance is writing here that surprised me how fantastic it is in that. It will make you cry, especially in your monologue intentionally sudden and unexpected. The surprising thing about his role is that he is a difficult character to say that we have seen before. We have seen many characters with emotional scars, many people with mental retardation, many loners, many passionate self-centered artists, but Sandler's Charlie Fineman is none of these. You can try some of them in some way, but your character is truly unpredictable and completely individual. It is a joy for the audience to be emotionally attracted to him and thrown in any way by someone whose problems, mentality and provocations are completely different from most characters like him. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle offers an interesting performance on a completely different level. He is every man. He is the most normal person possible in the world, so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his, or at least one that is interpreted in the way he plays Alan Johnson, whose name is even on the assembly line. Cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny, joking, intelligent and stupid, like so many normal people are. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who have barely done anything for a while. In smaller but colorful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife, Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge, Robert Klein is Sandler's desensitized father-in-law. <br /> <br /> Mike Binder's script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all its forms. It is much more subtle than, for example, Babel, and has an ideal much closer to home. <br /> <br /> The camera is only interested in the reality of its images instead of mere style. This movie seemed like a kind of answer to the style of the kitchen sink of the seventies. The cinematography was grainy and unbuttoned, but that was its charm. It was not about attracting us to the camera itself and to the brightness that would have diluted their stories with such. <br /> <br /> Music, which plays an important role in the film, and its title, is very powerful. Near the beginning, you feel that you are going to like another soundtrack of About Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine, but soon you realize that something more than that awaits you. In fact, the film is full of a lot of music that stimulates many of the most emotional scenes. <br /> <br /> Reign Over Me is an important statement not only for society but also for the film itself. This shows that even the director of Blankman is capable of doing wonders.
