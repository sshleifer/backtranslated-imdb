One night I saw "Speak easily" and I thought it was fine, but I was missing something. Maybe Buster Keaton, strangely speaking, threw me out, or the laborious delivery of a protagonist. However, the next day I kept thinking about the movie. I could not get the Durante song out of my head, I tried to remember better the first scene of Thelma Todd, I considered that perhaps Keaton made some funny falls and physical comedy. The next night I saw a scene with Thelma Todd as a captivating showgirl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with their sex appeal. A very funny scene, the excellent actors, their faces, their eyes, their silly expressions. So I saw another scene, his show is opening on Broadway. Buster in his happy innocence ruins every act. Once again, I was laughing out loud, appreciating Keaton's clowns and falls. So the next night I went back to see the whole movie, and this time I see it for the first time: It's Great! Is amazing! It is sublime! Three great comedians! Todd dance! During sings! Keaton speaks! Of course it is not perfect, but there are many laughs in this photo.
