"Saving Grace" is never incredibly fun, but it produces a few laughs and I enjoyed it to a great extent. Brenda Blethyn is a good actress and does a good job of portraying the widow Grace, who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her huge debts. The cast of support also does a good job. The French actor Tchecky Karyo has a small funny role. The premise alone is attractive. The idea of ​​a hill woman growing up and smoking a pot sounds pretty funny. And the movie plays with the premise wisely from time to time. Of course, there are flat moments, like one in which two old women confuse Grace's marijuana with the tea leaves and begin to take out children's antics in the store where they work. That was a gag that did not take off completely. The tone of the movie is weak and occasionally boring, but I had enough laughs to give a recommendation to this Englishman. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
