Norman, is that you? It was (this is all third-hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to an African-American family of a Jewish family, when it made the transition offstage and on the screen. In addition, it was one of those films originally filmed on video, so the impressions of the theater could not have been so good. Still, the performances of Redd Foxx and others were quite good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to tell you is that the movie is a PIECE OF THE PERIOD: it reflected the attitudes of the mid to early 70s about discovering that you have a gay son or daughter in your family. Just for that reason, it's quite interesting, if not a little "hollywood". Do not believe me Take a look at the lines on curtains, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the movie really shines in a couple of areas. There is a side split scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find his wife, who fled with his brother (!) To Ensenada in a prepared Pinto. The phone conversation across the border is really memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did their gay routine that they used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. As far as I know, this is the only time this routine was filmed. And, it's a slightly cleaner and much shorter version, they told me. Still, it's vintage Madame, and it should not be missed. People are still stealing Wayland lines; the man was truly gifted Enjoy the movie!
