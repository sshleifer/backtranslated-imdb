In a nutshell, the best romantic comedy in history. This film achieves what all the great films fight: the creation of a world and a time that we want to revisit and we are happy to be part of the human race. When I'm blue, this film lifts my spirit and makes me laugh (and that's still true after many presentations, always fresh). <br /> <br /> All the actors are in top form. The characterizations are so difficult and the characters combine so well that they forget the actor (it is usually difficult to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). The cast of support is always brilliant: Fry ("agae", "a total pygmy pack"!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists as "Greek choir" - "but time does not exist"), Durning ( "something we can launch from NJ"), Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins boss and co-worker at the service station), and Curits (Eisenhower, how many comedies does Eisenhower have?). <br /> <br /> Don Do not miss this overlooked treasure.
