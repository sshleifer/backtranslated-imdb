Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. A choral comedy full of its own landmarks, with a frenetic pace and many glorious moments, we laugh and laugh, what a party! The music is everywhere, and also the shots, the animals, the crazy bastards, the sex and the amazing gadgets and inventions, everything is visual colorful to entertain alone. The pure cinema in essence. A wonderful experience to see. And one is especially grateful because good comedies are so rare and so wonderful. Well, this is one, and if you enjoyed Kusturica's previous films, you'll love it, although, as in all comedies, it's a chemical reaction, and you have to be in the mood for it.
