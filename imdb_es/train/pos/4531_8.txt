This is a cleaver movie that presents love through the centuries. The film consists of Keaton looking for a lady of love in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and in the present (1920). In all three cases, he is the usual weak Buster and he fights against Wallace Beery for his lady's love. Of the three periods of time, I think I liked the Roman, but I admit that it could have been the best too. In fact, I liked the scenes with the lion who was obviously a guy with a disguise, as well as the strange car race in the snow, but what I enjoyed the most was seeing all of Keaton's amazing stunts. However, the three periods of time were very funny in the old way and the movie, although it is not the best, is still an exceptional and enjoyable movie. Check it out!
