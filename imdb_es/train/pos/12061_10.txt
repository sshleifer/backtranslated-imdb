From time to time, in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are crafted, and one is amazed by its brilliance. This is not less than a diamond! This is a film full of restlessness, chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favorite horror films of all time! And, of course, it probably contains the most terrifying and unique sequence in the whole horror story! Every time I watch the movie, and it reaches the point where you know it will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I will be scared, but it never stops happening; I never do it right, and I feel as terrified as the first time I saw it! Now, it must be said, in order to frighten a horror fanatic, that is nothing but pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, they take pride in the art of acting, they do not need any special effect to transmit the atmosphere, they rely on the power of the powerful story and the chilling (in this case) of suggestion and anticipation. Each element is impeccable, from the pieces, the performance, the story, to the threatening environment. Pauline Moran could surely make the devil whine, that's for sure! As a final note, if for some crazy reason you do not like this madness, you honestly do not know what the horror is about and, frankly, you do not deserve to know either. Thank you!
