I really liked this movie because it's a true story set in the Amazon, a part of the world that has always intrigued me. I think a condensed form of the book was published in "Reader's Digest" shortly after the actual event occurred. <br /> <br /> Because I am a "baby boomer", the character and the actress are my contemporaries, and for this reason I related it to the movie. I also believe that the film is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes that the character follows the currents that lead to the river and coastal settlements where he can get help, as well as other survival techniques. The most important thing was his willingness to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope that viewers learn something of this, in addition to seeing it as entertainment. <br /> <br /> I wish the movie would be released on VHS and DVD soon, since I would like to add it to my video collection. . It should also be shown more often on satellite movie channels.
