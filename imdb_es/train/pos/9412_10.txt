When I saw this movie in the 1950s, I also wanted to be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I took a friend to see her a second time. I do not think she was as impressed as I was! This movie was funny but serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were quite new. The lessons of this film could be applied to topics related to GM's experimentation today.
