14 years since this show was made and it is still the best show that has ever been made. The writing was first class and the production unsurpassed. This show would never be done today and that is a shame. I hope that if you are thinking of finding this show to see what you do. <br /> <br /> AG came out the year I left high school when my favorite TV show was the x file, which gives you an idea of ​​why I entered this program for the first time. Was AG a much better program with better writing but only got a reason? I know that this is not the only program that only has one season. Another example that comes to my mind is that the lone gunman (files x disappear) had a good wording and was fun, but also had a season. It does not seem right! <br /> <br /> We also have to remember that this program existed before shows like twilight made the dark shows "great", so I think this may have also let the show go downhill. <br /> <br /> Watch this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
