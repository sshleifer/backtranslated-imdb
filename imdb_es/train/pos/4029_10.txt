I have no words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could have written such a real description of the partition days. The movie chased me for many days. <br /> <br /> Urmila played the role of his life in this movie. She put life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did no less in his role as Rashid. It is hard to imagine anyone other than these two playing the role of Puroo and Rashid. The costumes of Punjabi looked so natural in Urmila and Manoj looked like a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did a fabulous job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes that you simply can not get out of your mind. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, it brings tears to your eyes. The climax is simply murderous. I expected a tragic end, but fortunately, the ending was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc. You can not miss it.
