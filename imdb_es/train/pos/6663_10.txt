This film is about a dysfunctional family, but not just as a dysfunctional family. It is the Family of the Father of our Nation (India), although the film focuses mainly on the strange relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son, Harilal Gandhi. It shows how the Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life to achieve our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son tried to approach, the Mahatma stood between them. This is a very well made movie. Akshaye Khanna has proven to be a great actor. He expressed emotions very naturally. Darshan Jariwala, who mainly stars Plays-Gurukant Desai's lawyer in Guru, has played Gandhi beautifully (as a true Human Being, unlike Ben Kingsley who made him look like a God) Shefali Shah, the girl from Monsoon Wedding, also He has done a very good job. to show how Kasturba Gandhi was divided between father and son. This film is moving and so is his soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava" sung in a very unique way. I saw this movie just 3 hours ago (it was released in Dubai the day before, on day 2) and when the movie ended, "Pin Drop Silence" appeared and, when leaving the theater, NOT ONE person pushed another (Can you imagine? We Indians do not push?) NOT ONE! There was a sacred silence ...
