THE LAST WAVE will never win the general audience. It is a slow but fascinating film for those who are willing to accept it. An Australian property lawyer is being asked to handle the case of five aborigines accused in the murder of one of their own. Soon all kinds of omens and omens will arise, since the death of man involves a tribal theme that was not intended for the white man's court, and very soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy. It seems that the end of the world may be near, and he and the aborigines may know this but nobody else knows. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is at its height here. David Guptil, a familiar face of several other Australian films and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines on trial. THE LAST WAVE is simply not for everyone, nor is MAGNOLIA (both have strange things that fall from the sky). Check it out on a slow Saturday night.
