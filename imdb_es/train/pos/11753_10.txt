Hi, I'm from Taft California and I like this movie because it shows how the people of the small town love our sport. Soccer is the main thing in Taft and this film shows how important it is personally. I think they should do another one, but instead of the actors they use the children to play well. Show our determination that we have beaten Bakersfield in all the games over the past 6 years and, as I am a senior, it is my last chance and then your university, we have runners who lead the Declara and I am the next if you want know me I'm Kyle Taylor and I average seven to eight yards per carry and about five times per game, I go out with a 75 or around that yard, so visit us on our website. and go to our sports bye page
