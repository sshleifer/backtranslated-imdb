['Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. Kurt Muller (Lukas), an anti-Fascist, a worker in the underground movement, often wounded and wanted by the Nazis, needs a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law. But he discovers that there really is no escape since one of the guests (Coulouris) suspects his true identity and is more than willing to sell it. <br /><br /> Great performances abound in this film, written much to expose the liberal view of Lillian Hellman. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time of its launch, as the evils of the war and what was happening to people in other countries reach safe American homes. The big controversy of the film today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar on Humphrey Bogart in &quot;Casablanca&quot;. Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful presence on the screen and a fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendent like Kurt. The monologue he has about the need to kill is heartbreaking, just to mention a scene. <br /><br /> Although this is not what one thinks of as a Bette Davis movie, she offers a masterful performance here as Kurt&#39;s loyal and loving wife, Sara. His heart tugs and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender. <br /><br /> The last half hour of the movie made me cry with the honesty of emotions. Lillian Hellman is not a cup of tea for everyone, but unlike &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, she has written some really nice and wonderful characters, and an excellent story given to casting and production values of Warner Brothers. Highly recommended']
