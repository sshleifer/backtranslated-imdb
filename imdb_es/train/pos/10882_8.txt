This is not a bad movie. Follow the new conventions of modern horror, which is the movie inside a movie, the well-known actress who runs for his life in the first scene. This film takes advantage of the old convention of a psychopath killer, and manages to do something new and interesting with her. It's also always good to see Molly Ringwald back for the attack. <br /> <br /> So this could be an example of what the genre has become. Cutting hits all the marks, and actually it's scary in some places. I liked that I gave him an eight.
