This movie was made in 1943 when I think Judy was at its peak (it looks prudent). In her previous film, For Me and My Gal, people often say she looks emaciated. Well, in this movie it looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has talent for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very funny, especially at the beginning when you are trying to organize an audition with John Thornway. In my opinion, one of the funniest scenes is the interpretation of Lady Macbeth by Judy and when John is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking (Lol). <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean, one minute he despises her and the next they leave a date, and the next time they meet after that date they are in love. <br /> <br /> Another point that I did not like was the opening night. If I were Lily, I would be furious with John, but she does not ... it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> But in general, I would have to give a 10 to this movie because it's just wonderful and almost perfect.
