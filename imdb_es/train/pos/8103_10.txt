This was the most expensive film, when it was produced. Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells were distressed by his poor grades, for good reason. It was and still far ahead of its time. Apart from the seemingly bad direction, probably editing, at the beginning, the work moves towards an amazing conclusion. <br /> <br /> if it is the role of "Chief" of Sir Ralph Richardson, or even better, that of his wife, Sir Cedric's, as an adversary of space navigation, the central role of Raymond's "John Cabal" Massey: they all offer amazing performances. <br /> <br /> the scene with mr. The incomparable set of Korda, of the little girl, is directed to an absolutely "incomparable" scene, and comments: "Is life still more and more beautiful?" It quickly brings tears to any parent / grandparent. This is not a film for young people, unless they are 'experienced' and, rather, those who have seen 'the horror' to which it is opposed. <br /> <br /> Sure, the 'false skydiving' looks horrible, although the use of a 'magnetic barrel', now called 'dough driver' can be seen as ridiculous, compared to rockets. Give Sir Korda a break: Mr. Wells made that choice. and with +/- $ 8 million, this film went far beyond the "excess budget", so he focused on what he could manage. <br /> <br /> the real power of this great cinema rests on 'John La' final declaration of Cabal's human destiny - his friend 'Passworthy' doubts the wisdom of space navigation by saying: 'We are so small animals' . The appropriate response of John Cabal is, (paraphrased) 'Yes, little animals, and if that is all we are, we must live and die as such'. they stand under a large astronomical telescope. He sweeps his hand over the night sky. 'However, we can have the whole Universe, or nothing' '. Then, the final chorus breaks into 'What will it be? '--- this is not' Star Wars', 'Blade Runner' --- anything I can consider 'Big' --- this is the Real Thing. <br /> <br /> I remember all Steven Hawking's most recent speech, in his last 'Medal of Honor' --- 'Humanity must leave Earth, or die' .-- the core of this work: love the 'standard entertainment', but this 'relic', for the intelligent viewer, offers much more. 'What will it be?' to be in the right 'mood' --- whatever is necessary --- this will take your breath away --- 'guarontee' --- in general, for humanity? The most significant thing about cinema. <br /> <br /> Since the publication, I note that many have commented on the poor quality of the means of the examples of "survival". In the 1980s, I developed a "proprietary" "colorization" process that required a "clean" original. This led me to Michael Korda, who sadly noticed that everyone was gone, so we must taste what is left, "sad but true".
