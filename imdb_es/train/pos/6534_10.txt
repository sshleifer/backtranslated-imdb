I had heard that this movie was good from many of my friends who saw it, and everyone said it was amazing, so I had very high expectations, and Nancy Drew exceeded those expectations! It had fun parts, it kept me entertained with the action and all the guys who were trying to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing like Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was very good, too. I would definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why those guys tried to kill us?!" Corky: "Yes, I was also wondering, it's really scaring me a little!" <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate when people try to kill me, it's so rude!" <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew
