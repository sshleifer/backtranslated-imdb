This was a lovely presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well interpreted by animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority and innocent wonder. The quote (or scene) that I remember vividly is when Hemo gets tired of "all this plumbing ... you have not learned my secrets" and threatens to break in, the Scientist responds with a single word "Thalassa" - The salt water that horrifies the writer of fiction, but appeases Hemo and is transmitted so clearly to the chemical aspects of blood. <br /> <br /> This splendid combination of entertainment and information makes this a classic as fresh and fascinating as the day of its release. Stimulating interest and imagination is essential to teach children to love learning.
