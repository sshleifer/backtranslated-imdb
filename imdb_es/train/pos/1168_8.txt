Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian or Sicilian professional murderer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers do not agree. In terms of content, this highly enjoyable action movie does not have one; In terms of pure fun, it's fun, it's very melodramatic, violent, quite brutal, the car chases are remarkable. "Arzenta" is an unpretentious film, but very nice, much better than the current Hollywood garbage that receives the same stamp. It comes from Delon's rather short flirtation with the Italian cinema B of the 70s. He carefully uses the person of the rude guy from Delon, who belongs to the gallery of evil thugs he made in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the fact that Delon made this movie, which had a role in a good Eurocrime movie. <br /> <br /> The score is very good, with a good introductory song Make feel the enthusiasm that the Italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work, where the musical art has an important part. <br /> <br /> At Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out, the very attractive Erika Blanc (31 years old in '73) appears as a nameless prostitute. Meanwhile, Arzenta's girlfriend, Sandra, is played by Carla Gravina (a star who practically left the movies after '75). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" It is interesting to film an ambitious visual conception, some peculiar expressionist angles. The film was directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari, who also made Zorro (Delon's comedy). Not to mention that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very different. The first is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie - the second is a cheerful comedy, more like a parody, though remarkably coherent and cleverly made. Duice Tessari directed films like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Sons of Satan, The Bloodstained Butterfly, Long Live Death ... Tua! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
