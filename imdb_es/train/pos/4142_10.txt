FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the most fun, original and entertaining work I have had the pleasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie is not, by any means, up to Hollywood standards, not even a live one. The movie-to-movie comedy starring Terry "Hulk" Hogan, in terms of camera work, editing, acting, budget or anything else. <br /> <br /> What this film has is very original and a nice story, and obviously people who love it do it, and the enthusiasm of all the actors and the team really breaks their budget and their failures in the performance. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that it does not. You do not need a big budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what you're doing. <br /> <br /> Simply the best movie in history. I do not care how you get it, you rent it, you ask for it, you steal it, you download it, you only see this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I just hope you make a DVD version.
