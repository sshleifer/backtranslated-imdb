So, Fox disconnected halfway through a drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> How bad is that? Do you expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a real risk of not discovering what happens? Why were not the remaining episodes, already filmed, broadcast in the United States? They were broadcast elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! You are listening? This was a great show, but you left us hanging. If you are going to introduce new dramas / mysteries, at least expose a conclusion before abruptly ending the central theme. Every time something like this happens (and it seems to happen a lot with you, that is, Fox), there are more of those who "wait and see" before investing their time. This means that you will see an interest interest that is artificially low and is more likely to end the series. Watch? It is a vicious circle. Do not let us fall again ...
