This is what makes me proud to be British. This is, by far, the funniest thing on television. The league is made up of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the charming Reece Shearsmith. Totally underestimated, this horror comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and the strange phrases, "Hi Dave." It is a comedy that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the gentlemen's league is that it's always fresh, and always pushing the limits. You do not need to depend on phrases (unlike little Britain) to make it fun. The fact that the league is willing to kill its most famous and iconic characters, shows us that they have steel balls.
