If I remember, Ira Gershwin, the lyricist and brother of George, offered the Gershwin catalog for this film and the producers took it. In many ways, it was a typical 50s musical made by Freed Unit at MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli with much help from Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> The Gershwins were, of course, among the greatest of all the Broadway musical teams, but, in my opinion, George himself was one of the greatest American composers, period! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two best male dancers in the musical film (Conjecture as to the other?) And I do not think his casting was in doubt. But, I think the rest of the cast needs an explanation: Oscar Levant was a remarkable personality in his time and, as a true friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this film. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer, as well as a famous neurotic and hypochondriac and here, as always, he plays himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was a stranger at the moment and she was of the French type "gamin". A talented dancer, she was never a true beauty. George Guétary, who plays the role of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean Henri Baurel, was Greek and not French, but he's certainly more than fine as a French boulevardier, even if he's a little too young for the role. <br /> <br /> The voice of Gene's hat is useful here, but Guétary has much better vocal equipment. Even though Gene was better chosen elsewhere because, obviously, in "Singin 'in the Rain" where his character is much more calculating, even here he is sometimes shown as a heel (it was not for nothing, chosen as the Joey's original heel in Pal Joey, the Broadway musical.He was not so thrilled with his "I Got Rhythm" scene with the kids, which does not seem as spontaneous as he intended in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I Also found that the character of Nina Foch, Milo, is quite annoying. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the film is obviously the long ballet at the end of the film based on the title of music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great French impressionist painters. <br /> <br /> It was hard for me to believe Gene and Oscar, as artists with problems, and I do not believe that the musical numbers are as well configured as they could be, but in general, Music from Gershwin is very well served in this movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD is well done with clear and clear graphics (when they are possible). Ed to be be) and the mono sound is good but a bit superficial.
