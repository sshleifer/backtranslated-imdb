This was a first-rate movie with a first-rate cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and, especially, Christopher Lloyed, are recognized in this charming film about the angels of real life that help the baseball team Angels. You never know, it could happen. I loved Lloyd's role in him. He was hilarious. The story is about changing your life, since the belief of the children in the Angels helped to become furious, hardened and bitter. The manager Glover sees the best in people. The film was well made and also about seeing the best of people and achieving your dreams. It was fun, charming, moving and sad, all very well done. You will like it (or love it). I guarantee you. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
