I think it took a lot of guts for her to show up like that. It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what most helps people. But, in her case, what she did was remarkable. I have been in the field of mental health for five years and I think it's great that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I think she helped. I always thought it was great and always will be. I'm glad that she wrote this book and that the movie was made. She is a remarkable lady and I hope she continues to act. She has gone through a lot and confronted him. I would really love to see her work more with the children, especially the children's actors. Her terrible experience should not have happened and I think she would be a wonderful mentor for the young people. The movie moved me so much that it moved me a lot. When suffering a traumatic brain injury that caused the appearance of my disorder and having PTSD, it is good to know that someone has the courage to show their life as she did. I think it helped this nation and the people in general to realize that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you Mrs. Duke, or Anna, whatever you prefer.
