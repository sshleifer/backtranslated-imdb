This may be the only movie that really comes close to capturing in a movie the essentially irreversible world of the American college experience of the late 60s and early 70s. Go ahead, name another movie that even comes close to this one: "Getting Straight "? "RPM"? These are the cartoons. "Return of the Secaucus Seven" has its moments, but that is a retrospective film about individuals (obsessed with oneself) rather than a film about a moment and a place that are shown * in * at that time and place. "Drive, He Said" portrays, with subtlety and nuances where it should, and a quick kick in the shorts, where that is the only appropriate form: the movement against the draft, the ambiguity of the great university sports (especially when there is a war in), the sexual revolution of the period and the general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was like that. <br /> <br /> The entire cast deserves praise (as does the director, of course), but a particular eulogy must be reserved for Bruce Dern, as a basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual , except for that time, love of interest. William Tepper, as leader, also qualifies a real round of applause for both his perfect capture of the student-athlete of the time and for really playing college basketball in the movie (remember Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story"? ). <br /> <br /> In general, a classic of the class - and the last movie in which someone currently in sixth grade should be writing comments on ("boring", "repellent" - um, right, son, Por please go back to your Arnold movies). Why is not this imdb movie available?
