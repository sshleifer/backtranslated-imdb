"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most incredible movies in Hong Kong I've seen. It is a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The movie has some wonderful images and incredible fights. I especially love the fight. Scene between Wu Ma and the tongue of the tree demon. A truly original and refreshing film and another excellent recommendation from Embalmer.
