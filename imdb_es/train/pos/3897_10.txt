This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. We had several friends for one night and, for some reason or another, we had navigated the channel to HBO during the course of the night. Someone by the name of "Eddie Izzard" was on. I tried not to laugh too hard at the first jokes. I did not want to be considered "responsible" by the rest of the group for enjoying something that was obviously killing me. After saving my laughs more than what was healthy, I let it go, like the others (by the way, we were not drugged, nor did we talk about insurance and pensions ...). We suffocated after that. The lines of the story, the plot, the strange but ingenious connections along the sketches are nothing less than brilliance. Since then I have been addicted to every piece of Eddie-Izzard comedy that I can get my hands on. His work is pure genius. His comedy appears effortlessly. It's more like that hysterically funny friend who spends time in your house and rambles about this or that ... It's convulsively funny. It gives you the impression that the joke is between you ... and he himself, after all, the only true fans of humor. If you are disillusioned with this video, there is no sense of the penultimate mood, or humor, as they say in the UK.
