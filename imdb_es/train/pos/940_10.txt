IN AGREEMENT. I'm partial. I live near Shrewsbury in England, where this wonderful movie was filmed. It still looks the same now. I remember them filming here with a lot of intensity, and fake snow on the streets for days and days. Often, when I'm walking through Shrewsbury I see a street or a house and it reminds me of this movie. <br /> <br /> Scrooge by George C. Scott is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions. His physical appearance is not the typical miser. Scott's is big and imposing. A man who finds the smallest ones himself as inferior. <br /> <br /> We all know the history and the appointments. The book is one of the most appreciated works in the English language. And I do not think there are many cynics who say that people are not capable of changing and redeeming. This version of the film portrays all that very well. George C. Scott may be American but he plays the role of the English miser with a wonderful ability. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you have not seen this version, I strongly recommend you do it. It is usually available for a very small amount of money ... or are you too bad?
