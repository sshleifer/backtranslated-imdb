This movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn and, unless my uncle ran for president of the world, it should never be considered porn. <br /> <br /> Now that the problem is solved, I can say I highly recommend this movie, since its problems are still widely available. It's funny, the acting is excellent and raises serious questions (curious). <br /> <br /> I do not understand why this movie was so mistreated, probably that's why I plan never to visit. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern movement of disturbances, confusion, curiosity and her wit are her main attributes, occasionally she is angry, but are not we all?
