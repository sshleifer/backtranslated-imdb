Why has not this been published? I thought I should be a bit silly since I had not been. How wrong a girl can be! This movie is, in a word, exciting. <br /> <br /> You will be captivated. It keeps your attention from the beginning and its rhythm never slows down. <br /> <br /> The final part of the film, the "episode" as it was (without revealing anything, you saw it in the trailer) is also a must. You will choose a favorite, you will be surprised, you will not be able to make a cup of coffee because you must find out what happens. The adrenaline goes up and you can not look. Congratulations to the actors, it is very credible. And it does not stop there, they have a final shock for you. <br /> <br /> It also makes you question the reality television and if you would see it. And at what distance from this are we really? Endemol (who is the older brother) did a television show in the Netherlands last year, offering the kidney of a dying woman to patients who need a transplant. In the end, it was revealed that the show was a hoax, apparently to raise awareness about organ donation, but are we getting too close for comfort?
