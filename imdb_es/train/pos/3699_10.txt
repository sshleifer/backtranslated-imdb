"Who Loves The Sun" works its way through some thorny subject with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only attractive, but often fun. It's been a while since I've found such a touching and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful, drawing the eye with beautiful landscapes and tranquil landscapes. The peaceful images contrast beautifully with the tension between very human characters, very defective and yet very pleasant. Due to the excellent cast, the five main players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who loves the sun". It's a really fun movie that looks at the wounds we can inflict on each other, and the incredibly difficult but equally rewarding forgiveness process.
