The group of people travel to Belgrade in a horrible bus driven by a drunk driver and his foolish son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by many hilarious events that describe the fall of the nation's spirit in 1941 with much irony and are so funny that even today they are used as common jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a 4-foot-high peasant with his 4 children who are almost twice as big as him. In the end, the film takes a dramatic turn and the journey becomes nothing more than the song of a swan from a dying country.
