I really enjoy this movie. The acting of the adult actors was great, although I found the main boy a bit stiff. But he behaved very well for being a new talent. The humor is very sublime and it's not in your face like most of Hollywood's trashy comedy. That is to say. The crazy professor. If you have a short attention span and are used to typical Hollywood things, you probably do not like it, as it is a bit slower. I picked it up on Blu-ray and I have to say that the image quality is first class. Probably one of the most attractive Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were great too. They were pretty much eliminated, but it's probably a good thing, since most of the deleted scenes really did not add anything.
