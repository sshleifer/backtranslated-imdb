Christopher Smith is a fan of obvious horror and this is clear in his debut horror film 'Creep'. 'Creep', although a bit loose in information, is worthy of a true bloody classic. A little less bright than the recent horrors of the United States (remake of Amityville Horror, remake of House of Wax), this dark and frightening tale follows Kate (Franka Potente) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she , and others along the way, Try to escape from a murderous attacker. Although some negative reviews have programmed this film, I really believe that with a tight budget and for a UK production of the first director Smith, Smith "Creep" really lives up to his name. It offers a bloody action of accelerated rhythm more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast since the story is irregular in some areas, but with a perfect location and the best reaction of final character that I have seen in a long time, 'Creep' It offers some scenes that are undoubtedly nightmares.
