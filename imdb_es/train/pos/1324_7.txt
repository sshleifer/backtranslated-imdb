You sit there for half an hour and you see a story, believing everything, then you see another half hour of the same story completely tangled ... and then you put it back together. Sparkly. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I do not know if, apart from "Capturing the Friedmans" by Andrew Jarecki, there has been something like "Forbidden Lie $" by Anna Broinowski. Presents, exposes, defends, reveals and questions everything about Norma Khouri, author of "Honor Lost", the acclaimed and criticized 2001 bestseller on honor killings in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is incredible and what the film does is so exceptional that this "exposure" of Khouri is done with the full participation of Khouri. <br /> <br /> In the opening part of the film, Khouri presents his story about the alleged murder by honor of a friend of his in Amman, the story of the book. It sounds completely believable, convincing. <br /> <br /> Then, its history is denied, exposed, by eminently credible and convincing people, as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigative reporters there and in Australia, where Khouri lived. a time. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denies the accusations, taking a successful lie-detection test in the process. Another segment of devastating exhibitions arrives: it should not be specified here because that would diminish the value of the shock ... and then Khouri returns and faces the accusations (not all, but the essential ones in the matter of the book). /> <br /> And the Houdini act continues, round after round in this heavyweight fight, rocker prize, surprise after surprise, and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of resolution. Sparkly.
