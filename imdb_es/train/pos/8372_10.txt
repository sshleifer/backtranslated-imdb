What a masterpiece. To take the conflict of the cold war and transport it to the future. This movie is the satire of the highest order. In my humble opinion, it surpasses Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> The intelligent appointment of the two superpowers, such as the Confederation and the Market. Cons be commies and market, the west! exceptional. The intelligent use of the Joxs generation was ahead of its time. We are only really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering. Robots joxs tackled the subject directly in 1989. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is about the camaraderie of the humble man and how he can overcome the wishes of the government. This movie screams DO NOT DO WHAT YOU BASE, YOU WILL KILL US ALL. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT 10/10
