An entertaining film of kung fu, with scenes of action, plot and fight a court above the average of socky. All the cast characters are friendly and expert martial arts. The antics of Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan comedy are fun to watch, and his austere partner shows particularly impressive skills. For me, the only flagrant flaw in the film is the size of the cast: sometimes, things get a little confusing as the film cuts and switches between several subplots, and some of the characters are not as complete as one might wish . . <br /> <br /> But a kung fu movie must be judged first and foremost for the quality of the action, and Shaolin Temple definitely complies with that. The film culminates in a high body battle that allows each character to show their skills against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> In general, Shaolin Temple is a low budget kung fu movie. It does not live up to the quality of a good Jet Li movie, but it's definitely worth watching for fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Miscellaneous Notes: The release of the 1987 Warner Home video that I saw was (as expected) poorly folded, and lacked the full cast and crew credits.
