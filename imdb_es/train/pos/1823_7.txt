I remember seeing this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the strange thing is that I never saw it after that. The other day I was babysitting and my cousin never saw All Dogs Go To Heaven, so we rented both movies and saw them together today and he really loved these movies. So many memories came back to see this movie once again and I must admit that I even cried a little. I am 22 years old and the end still reaches me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most moving animated films and, honestly, I am surprised by this rating of 5.8. I thought that this movie would also bring good memories for others. I admit that the animation was a little typical, but the story is so lovely and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a game dog that is killed by another game dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he returns to Earth with a clock that he can not stop dialing or is the end of his life again. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for Carface and spy on him, they discover how Carface gets all his money, he has an orphan girl who talks to the animals and discovers who will win the races. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes false promises to get the money. But he ends up learning that perhaps he should put Ann-Marie first before himself when Carface returns with him in revenge. <br /> <br /> All Dogs Go to Heaven is the perfect family movie, it's not Disney, but This is an excellent family movie to watch. Not to mention it's so cute and touching. I know they are ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but this movie for me when I was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls. How could they not? They are so affectionate, and I think I'm going to cry again. But anyway, I would only recommend this movie to anyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
