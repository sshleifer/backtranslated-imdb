Very good drama, although it seemed to have some blank areas, which allowed the spectators to complete the action for themselves. I can imagine that life is like that for someone who can not read or write. This movie simply hit the real world: the wife who is suddenly the only supporter, the relatives who live with him and their fights, the troubled child who is beaten and then, typically, leaves school, a crazy husband who takes the Nest egg and buy beer with him. 2 thumbs up.
