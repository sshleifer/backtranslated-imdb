An oddly enjoyable effort, which combines a rather exaggerated plot that involves Adam and Burt and flashbacks to the original television series. Most of the flashback scenes were taken directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights" and I think his book was the inspiration for making this movie. Like the book, it left fans of the original series wanting more. <br /> <br /> If you missed this broadcast, it's definitely worth borrowing a tape from a friend who may have recorded it. I am making a copy for my children at this time.
