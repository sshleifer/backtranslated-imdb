['If Dick Tracy were in black and white, the Pope would not be religious. Giving a new meaning to the concept of color in a film, we are offered a unique experience throughout the world of comics, and is one of the few films that achieved it, thanks to a serious script, good direction, great performances. (Al Pacino is amazing) and the most important thing is a powerful combination of cinematography, art direction and costume design. Using only primary colors, the experience is quite different from everything we have seen before. And there is also a very successful tribute to the whole genre of gangster films, practically extinct from modern cinema. In general, I see this film as a new attempt and a touch of originality for a cinema that is based more and more on the old and already seen formulas. 7 out of 10']
