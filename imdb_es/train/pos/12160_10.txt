['A very underestimated black comedy, the best of a series of grand guignol movies to follow &#39;Baby Jane&#39;. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to &#39;Compulsion&#39;) who flee to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for aspiring movies, a group of hilariously hilarious children assisted by terrible moms. Debbie, with her blond wig (&quot;I&#39;m a Harlow, you&#39;re more of a Marion Davies,&quot; she tells Winters) leads the kids at her concert and beats a rich dad, Weaver. She also makes a deliciously fun tango and, above all, gives an exceptional performance, unlike everything she had done before. The atmosphere is a good mix of comic and mysterious. It looks wonderful with great period detail (30&#39;s). Lots of lovely hits in Hollywood and the terrifying tot movie. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as a drama coach: &quot;Hamilton Starr,&quot; he purrs, &quot;two r, but nonetheless prophetic.&quot; See it and love it.']
