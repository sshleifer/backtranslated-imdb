['I just watched this movie for the first time and I liked it. His dance was very entertaining. I read somewhere that she got the role in this movie because she knew how to dance. The landscape was great too. Yvonne is such a talented and beautiful woman. We laugh at silly kissing scenes, but that&#39;s the great thing about old movies! I grew up with her at The Munsters and I enjoy watching her in her previous films. They may not all be the best, but it&#39;s still worth seeing them perform and sing. I am slowly buying all your movies and watching them as I receive them. I have a large collection of your memories.']
