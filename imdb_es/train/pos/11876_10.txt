You know, when you look at this Brian DePalma movie today, I'm sure there's been a lot of criticism about how antiquated it is. Also, about violence. When I watched this movie on VHS when I was 20 years old, I thought it was also completely violent and rough. But I did not get 'it'. <br /> <br /> A few decades pass, man, how do I know how much I did not get in this movie !! This is a new version of an excellent movie that was made in the 30/40 years. How can you improve a classic? No longer But you tell a story that is updated through the eyes of the "new immigrants" during the most greedy decade, the 80 most lenient. DePalma, Stone and the gang present an ambitious, disturbing and very good movie. <br /> <br /> Yes ... Disco was dying and New Wave / Punk took over, but these immigrants from Cuba who had to make A new home in Florida could not tell the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted, but how to get it? For these immigrants, there was only one way to get it in Florida where they were ... having a lot of money and to get the money, he had to take charge of running a drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino It was fantastic for me as Tony Montana, the "little train he could". What an amazing way to see your main character in America: fight, kill, steal. lie, deceive everyone to obtain: "money, women and power". <br /> <br /> That's what Tony saw as the American dream. <br /> <br /> I wanted it, I wanted it. to live it and in his circle he did not see anything bad in how he went to get it. Tony Montana's command of the English language was saturated with the word "f" but, what did you expect, the completion of Emily Post's school for him and his classmates? See how they GO to America, what they knew, what they were exposed to. This is how Tony and his team chose "to be all they can be in the United States." It was all about power. Tony Montana would do and do ANYTHING to achieve it ... all his violence, lie, steal, twist, steal the glory. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that personified the 1980s is money laundering. Tony's team brought bags of drug money to the bank. Did they care about those who were close to Tony and his crew? In the clubs where he passed and drank? No Money was money and with money you get power. Tony was living very close to the pig. He and his pretty blond American got married and went very well for Michelle Pfieffer. <br /> <br /> After the rise to power of Tony Montana, he realizes that it is really horrible there. He is full of doubts, he is addicted to drugs, he is paranoid, he is surrounded by those who want to confront him in a bloody takeover, his trophy, the wife addicted to the blond American drug that discovers that it is a bore, he has to be so much of His empire because ... he is falling. And he leaves in a horrible and violent way, but once again I ask him, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> This is the quintessential movie of the 1980s, which tells a story of how some misunderstand the American Dream ... obsession. It's violent, bloody, too ... but it takes the point home disturbingly. Not all Cubans expelled from Cuba who landed in Florida in the 1980s were something like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But the demonstration of how miserable the 1980s was with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the United States to "be somebody" and have power took its tool in these poor characters and their lives in the U.S. <br /> <br /> Makes you wonder: has anything been learned from that moment?
