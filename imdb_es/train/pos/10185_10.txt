['Watching this movie was the most fun I&#39;ve had in the movies in a long time. However, I can not say if it is a good or bad movie, because you simply can not apply those simple ratings. This image has everything that any movie could have. It has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical and an absurd self-conscious art film. Everything is there, adding to a myth. <br /><br /> The basic premise is about an Indian couple, Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), who live happily in Canada, who rush to India to visit the husband&#39;s parents after a disturbing journalistic report. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple is in the middle of a fratricidal violence plot. At one point, the story is based on &quot;Not without my baby&quot;, but calling Shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice. <br /><br /> The line of the ostensible story takes a back seat to a series of surprising interruptions, including the dream of Shah Rukh Khan of Aishwarya Rai, that leaves as if it were of another film. In fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear very late in the film, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character. However, it makes up for it with energetic and truly unexpected performance. <br /><br /> Karishma Kapoor is the one who has more work to do in this film, and does an admirable job, having to link the twists and turns of the film with a show of credible emotion. Another notable presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of husband Shekhar. Nana Patekar dominates every scene in which she encounters a terrifying but nuanced character. <br /><br /> The film is not exempt from its share of realism. The violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with Karishma receiving heavy blows on several occasions. Sometimes, this violence is clearly disturbing, but ultimately it becomes surreal, since each dramatic sequence is often followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is only cathartic. <br /><br /> I have seen a part of the Bollywood releases, and the mix of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm. But &quot;Shakti&quot; raises the level by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous. It is a film that achieves the grandeur of a tragedy of Shakespeare, where the public of rabble and royalty is equally entertaining. It is a pure cinema, free, and the director Krishna Vamsi must have dreamed of having a good time throwing all the tricks of the book. Perhaps, the important message of violence that engendered violence and the inspiring extensions of maternal love were not the thoughts in my mind, but I left seeing &quot;Shakti&quot; euphoric. Making movies can be the most fun thing in the world!']
