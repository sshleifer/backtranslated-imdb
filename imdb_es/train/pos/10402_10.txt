The first time I saw Thief was a child, which makes me almost as old as the Jinn, I suppose. As any child would be, he was delighted with the imagination, the inventiveness and the energy of the film. Several years later, I realized the amount of satire and wit in the script I had missed in that first visualization. I have never missed the opportunity to see it over the intervening years. In addition to the script, the production transcends the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the narrator at her best. When you see Thief as a child, you know you had a great time. When you see Thief as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It's as timeless as the story it's about. An incredible job <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
