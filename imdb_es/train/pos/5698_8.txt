Val Kilmer ... They love him or they hate him, sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go 'Hey! This guy is a great actor! He did it with Jim's leather pants at The Doors and did it again with John's leather underpants. <br /> <br /> Turning around the fall and fall of porn super king John Holmes, Kilmer goes down on his knees as we unravel one of the greatest murder mysteries that Hollywood has never solved for more than twenty years, with Holmes as the main suspect in a brutal Manson-style massacre. <br /> <br /> What Kilmer does without effort is to exhort the life of the poor the celebrity, to do something to anyone who craves that overwhelms who had it and then lost it. Go see it, you will know what I want to say.
