This is a romantic comedy in which Albert Einstein, played wonderfully by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play as a matchmaker with his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interaction between these main roles is enhanced by an excellent cast of well-known characters. This movie is cute and funny ... a "feel good"! Abundant recommendations.
