Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and been bothered by the bloody violence would like to see this movie in its place. Although it was not a hit in box office or television ratings, The Fox Movie Channel still finds a good reason to show this annually. I liked the way they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who played his disciples to sing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon did not have long hair like any other Jesus in other movies, his appearance is quite similar to that of a Jew. . What surprised or surprised me was the scene in which Caiphas told Jesus about Pilate "And never forget that you are a Jew!" Although it may not have been a racist comment, Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days. The performance of Keith Michell's Pilate was huge, compared to his previous performances in "The Story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The Story of David." But if you compare his interpretation of Pilate with that of Telly Savala or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he really painted well the impression of a Roman procurator.
