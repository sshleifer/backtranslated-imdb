['This movie may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for television, but it&#39;s one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen. The film and its actors won several awards. It is fascinating, fascinating and will completely absorb you. The story of a persecution of an assassin in the iron curtain of Russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save the lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction, but apparently it is a true story. I highly recommend it.']
