['This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her early years as monarch of Great Britain. <br /><br /> &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; has an incredible production. Each scene is designed and decorated in immaculate detail. Extravagant costumes, sumptuous locations and beautiful gardens make &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; very impressive. I was more amazed by the reflexive cinematography. The way in which each person is placed in relation to the background or the foreground is well thought out, each scene is well composed. The scene that surprises me the most was when Victoria speaks with Melbourne. Melbourne was placed in the center of the door frame from the angle of Victoria, while from the angle of Melbourne, Victoria was located between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips. <br /><br /> As far as history is concerned, it is too compressed for a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria to follow and understand it. Many events are hurried or not even explained. I expected a great scene of the coronation, and disappointingly it only lasted a few seconds. <br /><br /> In general, &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; is a good movie, and it would have been even better if it had been longer, so that events could be adequately explained without hurry.']
