['I saw this movie by chance, I&#39;m curious about the trailer on television. I like it when I discover films like this, small and tender stories about ordinary people. Even if the ending is tragic, &quot;The Man of the Moon&quot; has some fun moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, with her innocent and pure love affair with Court. It is really a beautiful and moving love story with 3 high points: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, who kept his promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful cinematography of &quot;Old Lion&quot; Freddie Francis and the fantastic score of James Newton Howard, who It is really the soul of the movie. His songs (which deserve an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have transformed the script into music.']
