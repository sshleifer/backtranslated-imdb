The beautiful Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television journalist who travels with her team (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California, to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their lodgings have fallen and all the hotels in the city are full. So they travel out of town to a remote place and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). Would not you know? Ernest and his humble companion Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) hide a great secret in their cellar: "Junior" pitiful, deformed and with diaper (Stephen Furst, in a remarkable performance) that finally terrifies the girls. <br /> <br /> A deliciously deranged Lassick plays the real monster in this small and disturbing horror movie. It accumulates slowly but surely until an intense confrontation / climax, which delivers the horror in small doses until the final half hour. The hotel and the presenter winery (big echoes of "Psycho" here) are excellent scenarios. Above all, the perverse plot involves incest and patricide, allowing the film to acquire a truly dark quality. And yet, it also becomes poignant as we realize that Junior is not a one-dimensional evil ghost man, but rather a victim like the girls. The final shot is especially sad. <br /> <br /> "The Unseen" is a small horror movie worthy of being discovered. <br /> <br /> 8/10
