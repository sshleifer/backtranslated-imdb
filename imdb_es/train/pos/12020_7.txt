['The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn an outlaw who makes a long prayer to free himself from a gang in the chain. Do he and his friends go to the border with Mexico from jail and security? No, they do not because Coburn has a revenge mission. To kill the peace officer who brought him and in the process killed his wife. <br /><br /> That peace officer is Charlton Heston, who is now retired and knows what Coburn is looking for. As he explains to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was locked in a shack and involved in a Waco-type confrontation. His Indian wife was killed in the rain of bullets fired. It&#39;s not something he&#39;s proud of, she was a collateral victim in a chase. <br /><br /> So that we do not feel sorry for Coburn, he lets us know very well how evil he is. Heston is his usual unconditional hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He pulls everyone else out of the screen when it&#39;s on. <br /><br /> Coburn has the brilliant idea of making sure that Heston pursues him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where white authorities can not touch him. He knows that Heston has to do it personally then. <br /><br /> The Coburn gang includes Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum along who is his son-in-law. <br /><br /> The Last Hard Men is a nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I think it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. Surely it shows much of its influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate violence. Of which there is much. <br /><br /> For a bit of Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.']
