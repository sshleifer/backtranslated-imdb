"COSBY", in my opinion, is a CBS hit that must be seen! I'm not sure if I've never seen all the episodes, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I loved the theme song. If you ask me, even if I liked them all, it would have been good if Madeline Kahn had not died during the performance of the show. Since that happened, I've always wondered what the show would have been like. They all always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although you can see it on TBS now, I recommend you catch it in case it gets out of the air forever.
