An excellent cast makes this movie work; All the characters are very well developed and it is clear that the actors liked to film this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly the comedy I expected, much more a joyful look at the attempt to regain youthful glory than obscene humor. . For music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are cleverly fun. <br /> <br /> I hate to make direct comparisons with other movies, but a lot of this movie reminded me of the Alan Parker movies that I can not. help him: imagine if the Commitments really made it big, and then tried to recover that glory 25 years later.
