Greetings again from the darkness. What a relief ... a thriller that is really exciting! The new "IT" girl, Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates the screen time in this small and classic thriller of thriller by the famous horror film director Wes Craven ("Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street "). Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes this work is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes, since we see McAdams interacting with 4 or 5 people, either in person or on the phone. She is a natural. When he meets Cillian Murphy (the scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in what seems to be a coincidence, the film really takes off. See the two yuppie guys flirting while the public knows that something bad is brewing, it's amazing to make movies! The boarding sequence of the plane is fascinating and the more than 30 minutes on board are terribly claustrophobic. Craven makes us think about the participation of others and if someone will come to his aid. <br /> <br /> As with many thrillers, the only disappointment occurs during the climax when the lamb becomes a superhero. An interesting plot device leads us to believe that little Rachel has the accumulated frustration necessary to accomplish this, but we can not help shaking a little. The most exaggerated scenes involve angry hotel guests, an annoying passenger of the airline, Cillian's injury and FX at the hotel. The strength of the film is in the development of the character and in the psychological games between the protagonists. Unfortunately, the screen veteran Brian Cox is underutilized, but overall this is a thriller of suspense above average that is worth seeing for everyone, except the end.
