The American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna to take the plane to the United States. On the train he met a French girl, Celine. Although they met the first time, they spoke as good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him for a tour of Vienna. Then the romantic story developed. <br /> <br /> At first they were cautious. The funniest scene was to listen to a CD at the music store. They looked at each other, though their eyes did not come in contact. After a deep conversation, the relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene that they intended to call their respective friends. Their deep love for each other was fully expressed in words. <br /> <br /> Love is something strange. When you really want it, it will not come as you wanted. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important thing for love. <br /> <br /> Excellent script and performance that resulted in a great success of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best romantic movies. 9/10
