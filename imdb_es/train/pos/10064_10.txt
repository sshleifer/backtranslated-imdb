['The King of the Masks is a beautifully told story that confronts the preference of the family genre towards men in the face of human preference for love and companionship. Located in the China of the 1930s during a time of floods, we meet Wang, an elderly street artist whose talents are magical and capture the fear of all who witness it. When a famous opera actor sees and befriends Wang, he invites Wang to join his company. However, we learn that Wang&#39;s family tradition only allows him to pass on his secrets to a son. Upon learning that Wang has no children, Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking advice seriously, Wang buys an 8-year-old boy to fulfill his legacy; He would teach his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art. <br /><br /> Together, Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it. The story is absorbing. The setting is serene and the wardrobe simple. In short, it is an award-winning art film that can not help but move and inspire.']
