This is how I feel about the program. <br /> <br /> I started watching the program on reruns in 2001. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the program but it had too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> I HATE THE CHARACTERS OF MICHELLE AND JOEY! <br /> <br /> Stealing the stories from the old television shows. They even stole from "The Partirdge Family." Then, in an episode, "The family of the partridges" was mentioned. <br /> <br /> Actors who play different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn, the most notable when doing this, especially when she played herself in an episode. <br /> <br /> Michelle's character COULD NOT joke, but then they made this little girl act as "revenge" for her sisters. A joke about them about her. <br /> <br /> Story lines that came and went in one episode. Joey got the TV show with Frankie and Annette, I never heard of that after that. Danny suddenly playing the guitar. 1 episode that he is training soccer, 1 episode that is training softball / baseball. 1 game and you're out, eh Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse and Joey continue to get jobs REALLY RAPIDLY without experience. Only in a television program. <br /> <br /> I liked the D.J. And Stephanie's characters. I wish Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure and would have had a clean, drug-free adult life.
