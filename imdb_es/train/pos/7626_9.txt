['I&#39;ve loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979. I&#39;m still amazed at the precision with which Kurt Russell portrays Elvis, how he moves and the expressions on his face. Sometimes it&#39;s scary how much he looks, acts and talks like the real Elvis. Fortunately, this is being released on DVD, so all we have been waiting for finally we can have an excellent quality version of the film. I have listened to the detractors, who say that there are some inaccuracies, or some things that are left out, but I think that taking into account that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work, and that this was shown on television. (Only two years after Elvis&#39;s death!) He did a good job with this. In fact, I have not seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to it. Highly recommended']
