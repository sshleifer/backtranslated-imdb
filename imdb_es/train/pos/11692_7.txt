I'm not saying that just as a fan of Chris Rock, I say this as a person who had little expectation of going to this movie and who was wrong. The first defect was that everything was an end that everyone saw coming. The second mistake was that I found that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed false. Finally, the performance in this film was sub-par, with the best actor being Regina King and the worst Mark Addy. But I saw beyond that flaw and saw a solid comedy. In a heads-up scenario, seeing the sky you can expect, instead, is better. So for all Chris Rock fans, LOOK AT THIS MOVIE, you'll enjoy. He has a good reputation in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general: 7 out of 10
