['I read some previous comments that indicate that this film is losing steam towards the end of the film and also that it has an end similar to Cape Fear. I completely disagree. I will give a simple review for the normal viewers there. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought this was one of the best performances of Ed Harris. What an evil psychopath! I have a lot of respect for his performance after seeing his performance in this film. I was fascinated throughout this movie. If you like mystery thrillers, then this is definitely a movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is full of stars and I highly recommend it!']
