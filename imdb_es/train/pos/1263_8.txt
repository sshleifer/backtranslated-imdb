['I enjoyed this movie, and it is mainly granted to me because I enjoy watching Sean Connery perform, and this has the additional advantage of having Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne in it as well. The story has a grandmother looking for help from Connery because her grandson is in prison and she says he was convicted by mistake. At first it seems there may have been some racist aspects of the case, however, it later turns out that the main officer in the case was black and it seems he did some pretty bad things to force a confession from the boy. Well, the child tries to point to another murderer locked in the same prison, one who is about to be executed. He is also a particularly unpleasant person, since he is very happy for what he did, writing to the relatives of his victims and trying to get people to send them by mail. A lot of twists and turns in this with a bit of being something unexpected. I just enjoyed the character of Sean Connery trying to make sense of the whole test. The movie also drove me crazy in some areas, especially when you discover what finally happened. You get a very good interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne, since they all shine quite well in this one. In the end, this is a good suspense / suspense.']
