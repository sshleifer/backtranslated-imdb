I think that that creator (is) of the concept of this film deserves much more praise than they probably have received. Of course, it's not an Oscar-sized film, but, at least for me, this movie has left a lasting impression since I first saw it in 1984 (at the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think this is (and I hope it is not) a spoiler, but: imagine acting according to your impulses. Doing the first thought that appears in your head, saying the first words on your lips ... Without moderation, without conscience, nothing prevents you from saying or doing the things that, as intelligent adults, we know we should not say. or do In any case, this film only scratches the surface, does not go as far as it could. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with redoing older "classics" to try to capitalize today, would not it be nice to see them remake an old movie of modest success, for the sake of? Taking it away? to the next level? A little further, or even to explore what the original team did not do, could not or could not you try 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> That's just my opinion anyway. : o)
