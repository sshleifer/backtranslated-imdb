The movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could also enjoy it. It was extremely fun. Angelena Jolie was wonderful as Juliet. The parents are hilarious. They are food suppliers and enemies. Children play the roles of Romeo and Juliet in the work of the church. They fall in love and their parents try to keep them separated. (Spoiler Ahead. I think) They sneak away After a party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to get married at the end of the movie. If you do not like stereotypes and the corruption of classical literature do not look. If you do not mind, you'll have fun watching this one.
