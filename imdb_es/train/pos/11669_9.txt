Being the prototype of the classic adventure film Errol Flynn and having a good story, as well as two brighter co-stars in Maureen O'Hara (what an exquisite beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this film to all those that have even the slightest fondness for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> The best of Hollywood!
