I just apologize for this movie: there are many, very, many wide-angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond resistance, it's fair. They drove me crazy for the first ten minutes or so. But after that I made a kind of truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the movie, I had stopped worrying. This is a comedy too rich to be destroyed so easily. It's funny, it's witty, the comic delivery of EVERY cast is impeccable, and no matter how much Usher watches his characters through a cold, fish-eye lens, he may not care much for them, he manages to present them with warmth 'Mystery Men' is, in fact, not only more fun, not only smarter, but also deeper, that no one seems to have given credit for being. The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for example, besides being less fun than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. The satire of 'Mystery Men' bites when there is something worthwhile and gnaws gently when there is not. Do not make fun of anything old. That is why, contrary to what some critics have said (I must consider them as non-observers), they never run out of ideas. <br /> <br /> The "super" heroes are an attractive group. Sure, they're second-rate, but they're not just second-class. The Blue Rajah, for example, does nothing more than throwing cutlery at people, and he is not SO good at that. On the other hand, it is not comically bad either. He is better in his limited field than most people, and DOES practice diligently. He is not a buffoon, which makes him a much more fun character than if he were. If Superman is Christ in a cloak, Mystery Men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus, in layers. Much more fun Also much more endearing.
