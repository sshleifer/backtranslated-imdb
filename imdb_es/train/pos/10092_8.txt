The brilliant Elizabeth Taylor stars in this classic less known as a young Londoner who falls in love with a tea plantation owner in British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Upon arrival, she feels instantly out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture, as well as to be constantly aware of the furious herd of elephants. William Dieterle, who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie, does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost strange tone to this romance and the stage is one of the most beautiful I've seen with the black. and white themed mansion and the beautiful island landscape.
