What a fascinating movie. Even if it was not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a swindler in his element. And it's the kind of cinematic psychology that students can study to learn about compulsive liars. <br /> <br /> The author of Forbidden Love, Norma, revealed herself as a fraud in the media, but this movement really gives her a great opportunity. to clear his name. <br /> <br /> But the twists and turns that she gives the documentalist are incredible. What a patient woman! I really liked that movie. I have not read the book, but I just heard good reviews and went to see it on a boring rainy afternoon. The journey in which this film takes you is intelligent, interesting and totally fascinating.
