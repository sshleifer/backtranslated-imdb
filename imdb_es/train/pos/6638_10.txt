The attraction of old movies like this is that you can see a real picture of life in motion more than 100 years ago. Here there are many people leaving a factory, all of them dead for now and none of them even remotely aware of the magnitude of the invention they are walking before. I was surprised to read that a critic describes this film as boring as today's home videos, and at least another one mistakenly identified it as the first film made (it was the first film made at a rate of 16 frames per second, instead from the normal of 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Sure, all you see is a lot of people walking out of a building and passing before the director of photography on his way home from work, but this is a piece of curiosity for dozens of reasons , among them is that it was the first film made by the Lumi√©re brothers, which probably had a stronger impact on the development of cinema than any other individual or group of individuals in history.
