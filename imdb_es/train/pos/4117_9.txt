['&quot;DÃ´ desu ka den&quot; is the first color film of Master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly it is not about samurai, ronins, warlords or battlefields. It is within a very poor community in a poor neighborhood of Tokyo, where the inhabitants are drunks, beggars, vagabonds, battered women, losers. I do not know the reason why Kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors, but in fact they are very sad stories, some of them heartbreaking. Personally, I like the moving story of the child and his father who dreams of a house built by them; the story of the retarded child who believes he pilots a train; the story of the man who raises five children as if they were his own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman mistreated by her stepfather. My vote is nine. <br /><br /> Title (Brazil): &quot;Dodeskaden - O Caminho da Vida&quot; (&quot;Dodeskaden - The Way of Life&quot;)']
