I love this movie, but the music in all the alumni meetings is just stupid. <br /> <br /> The fateful game took place in 1972. That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all the music played in The dances, etc. They are from the 1950s and the early 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having just attended my 30th high school reunion, I can assure you that the latest music to be played at a meeting or dance The previous high school people are the music of their parents. <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding relevant music from the 70s; We all know that it was such a desolate time musically. But it was not completely destitute, and the producers of the film should have been more careful. I found those dance scenes very discordant with my suspension of disbelief in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> This was a bad decision of the director and / or producer.
