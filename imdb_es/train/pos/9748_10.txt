I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 and I got into classic rock (I'm still) ... <br /> <br /> I never liked opera because I hate soprano voices, but he changed all that. He was adorable in the movie and had an incredible voice. <br /> <br /> I heard on CNN that he died at home tonight because of pancreatic cancer, that we will miss him, and he definitely made his mark in this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy this Movie if I can find it, look and enjoy. * smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and have a look before it runs out.
