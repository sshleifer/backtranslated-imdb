['If there were two more charming artists than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968, I do not know who they were. The first time I saw this small and charming satirical jewel 25 years ago, at age 16, I consider that any year in which I have not been able to sit down and see it again is a waste. He is intelligent, peculiar, ordered, melancholic, sweet, subversive and absolutely charming. The romance of these two social misfits is very comical and terribly moving, never more than in Maggie Smith&#39;s desperate attempt to show the right card in the deck, a scene that is both fun and a perfect miniature portrait of the heartbreaking loneliness. And that final freeze on Ustinov&#39;s anxious, worried and loving face when he asks, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; - Has anyone ever made the appearance and sound of devotion so honestly and perfectly? I would never want to meet anyone who has not loved this movie.']
