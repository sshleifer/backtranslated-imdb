I loved it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I am also partial to Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the madness of the dinosaur. I read it for pleasure, but when I feel stressed or faint, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex allowed me to do it. That makes it a success in my eyes! I did not even walk away to do anything else while I was running. Whether or not it was rated "good" or not really does not matter to me. And no, I'm not a minor. I'm not an imbecile either.
