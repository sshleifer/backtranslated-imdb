I think it's a great movie. Because you can see how Diana's life is at home. She got so aggressive and wants to show that girls can fight too. I think she and Adrian were great actors. For this movie I'm also boxing. It really impressed me. The only negative part that I think. It's the end. Because it's fine between Diana and Adrian. But you do not get to see how he is at home. And I really did not like that you did not see how his father and his brother are either. but I think it was a great movie and I think I'll see it a lot more :) I recommend it to everyone, even when you do not like boxing, you can see much more than just boxing. I had a great time watching him.
