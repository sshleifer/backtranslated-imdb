In August of 1980, the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the subsequent trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused a stir in what was then a very angry nation. The media and the public had already judged and condemned the accused couple and were yearning for blood. What followed was a serious judicial error. <br /> <br /> Michael and Lindy Chamberlain said that when they were camping near Ayers Rock, in central Australia, a dingo had taken his ten-week-old daughter out of his tent when they were preparing to eat in the area. barbecue. Nobody believed them. Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael as an accessory after the fact. The whole country was full of whispers of ritual murder. Chamberlain's trial ended before it began. <br /> <br /> Lindy never showed her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict her, but the jury was influenced by pressure from the media and the public. How could we, as a nation, judge? From where we are, how can we presume to know? Unless there was absolute proof and no reasonable doubt, the Chamberlain should have been acquitted. <br /> <br /> Fred Schepisi's film unequivocally and wholeheartedly supports the argument of John Bryson's novel, that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges brought against them. That, in fact, a dingo took the baby Azaria on that fateful night in Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a bloodthirsty nation, determined that the truth be revealed. It shows Australia quite improperly as people who were totally obsessed with watching the Chamberlain pay! His script, co-written with Robert Caswell, vigorously shakes the emotions and will surely find the audience saddened and angry by the farce of justice that occurred. <br /> <br /> The outstanding Meryl Streep offers an incredible performance as the Woman accused of the most frightful acts. She gives life more convincingly to the small, strong Australian who was ready to face the accusations and set the world right. Even his accent is almost, but not quite, exact. A very good effort on the part of the teacher of that trade. Sam Neill is as good as Streep as the first faithful, but then disillusioned Michael, who can not understand why his world is falling apart, and begins to question his Christianity. His, like Streep's, is a demonstration of a great emotional force that will deeply move him. The entire cast of support is also excellent, with some of the best actors and actresses from Australia participating. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is also brilliant, with Director of Photography Ian Baker capturing this great land with splendor (especially Rock). The editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole film tight and emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a revealing score. <br /> <br /> For all Australians, this is a must-see, a shocking look in the mirror if you wish, to what We, as a country, did to a family that just wanted justice to be done and that the truth was known. As Michael Chamberlain said: "I do not think anyone really understands what innocence means ... for innocent people." <br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even in the return reports, the story of Fred Schepisi about the farce of justice suffered by the Chamberlain, who lost the baby Azaria in the rock of Ayres in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and honest. <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell have experts transferred John Bryson's novel to the screen, plainly telling the horrifying story of a terribly bad vacation for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose newborn daughter, Azaria, was taken of the family tent for a dingo only moments after they left her. <br /> <br /> In the midst of media speculation and the vicious public rumor, Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and Michael was charged as accessory after the fact. What followed was little more than a trial by the media, and once the Australian people determined to leave her, Lindy was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, although the prosecution could not present any reason and it was just circumstantial evidence. br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who fights Australia to prove her innocence. She is really amazing, and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Australian accent, although she does her best to sound louder. You might wonder why an Australian actress was not chosen on paper, but the power of the stars is probably the answer. Next to Meryl there is an equally impressive Sam Neill, outstanding as the husband who sees his world crumbling before his eyes, while feeling powerless to do anything about it. A strong Australian cast provides convincing support. <br /> <br /> The Jill Bilcock edition is very timely, Ian Baker's cinematography of rock and other steep locations is visually brilliant and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for the part. Truly a necessity for all conscientious Australians. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
