I watched the movie with two older children. Although I was not as smart as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. In a cinema surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was no sound, so I know that all the children liked it. There the parents also seemed committed. The death and apparent death of the characters provoked the appropriate gasps and comments. Let's hope that people realize that this movie was made for children. As such, it succeeded although I also liked it. Personally I liked the Scrat!
