Sandra Bernhard is a character, and without doubt one of the most fun women on earth. He began as a comedian in the 1970s, but his big break came in 1983 when he starred opposite Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese's underrated masterpiece, "The King of Comedy." However, his film career never took off. She made a couple of strange but entertaining images, like "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most surprising parts were those that she created for herself. <br /> <br /> "Without you I am nothing" is undoubtedly your best effort. Is it an adaptation of her successful off-Broadway show that made her a superstar? and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten perfectly choreographed and represented scenes, Sandra goes from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and performs songs that Burt Bacharach, Prince or Sylvester make famous. Director John Boskovich got Sandra to do a 90-minute performance on a force tour that is both sexy and uniquely fun. If you're a Bernhard fan, you can not miss this movie; It is a tribute to both her (strange) beauty and her unconventional talent as a comedian. And has the filmmaker influenced his work? "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", for example, would look very different if "Without You I'm Nothing" did not exist.
