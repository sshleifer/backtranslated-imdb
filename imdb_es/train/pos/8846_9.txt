['I really enjoyed this Sidney Lumet drama. The best word with which I could describe it is madness. Move the viewer for an hour and fifty minutes and do not let you breathe until the credits begin to roll at the end. Trust me, this movie will keep you guessing all the way. <br /><br /> The story is very well elaborated and almost brilliant. It&#39;s almost like a more complicated tarantino type story. The performance is incredible from all the leads and even the small parts, an excellent deal. I also loved the cinematography, it gave the real feeling as if it were an independent film. Everything was great. <br /><br /> This movie is exciting, exhausting and heartbreaking. It&#39;s almost hard to see but you&#39;ll be glad you did.']
