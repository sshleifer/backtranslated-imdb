['This show is awesome. I thought that the two episodes where Paul died were very sad; Actually I cried. But the other shows were impressive; Kerry was my favorite character, because I was on &quot;the dark side&quot;. I also thought that Bridget was funny because she was very cheerful. I also thought that the guy who played with Kyle was really cute. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic comments about everything. The guy who played with Rory was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really fun. This whole TV show is fun, and I&#39;d like you to still show it on TV. However, when they showed it on TV, I saw it every time it was turned on. The next time it appears, I&#39;ll see it again and again.']
