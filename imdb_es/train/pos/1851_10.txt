I saw this movie in August at the 27th Annual Convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Milwaukee, WI, which is the first public screening. THE MOVIE IS GREAT !!! Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the film and Denzel's address is successful. See it opening weekend. You will not be disappointed.
