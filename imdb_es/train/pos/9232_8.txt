Too many sources routinely group this reflective period drama, partly based on a historical fact along with a similarly superficial "nunspotation" that was a pillar in the European garbage cinema of the 70s, overlooking just anger that drives all the effort. Perhaps coincidentally, it was also the unique attempt of the director Gianfranco Mingozzi to make narrative films out of many well-received documentaries. <br /> <br /> With a secure configuration within a historical context, FLAVIA describes the growing rebellion of an Italian nun from the early fifteenth century (The performance of Florinda Bolkan's career, even surpassing her excellent work in the devastating Lucio Fulci, NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A DUCK), locked in the convent by his not so noble father in a desperate attempt to curb the sensual nature of the budding girl. When asked why women are relegated to secondary roles in the best of life as in the sacred scriptures, she faces ways in which male domination can break women's lives, an inspiring revolt driven by the despotication of Sister Agatha, older and maddened Maria Casarès of LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS by Marcel Carné and, more constructively, by a Muslim invasion. By joining the oppressors and perhaps inadvertently manipulating them to fulfill their orders, Flavia really becomes the outcast who already felt, with the tragic results expected. <br /> <br /> With his impressive widescreen compositions by Alfio Contini, who killed Michelangelo. Antonioni's ZABRISKIE POINT is an intransigent and austere account of the fierce struggle of a woman but, ultimately, useless against the patriarchal society that did not grant her any rights beyond motherhood or prostitution, like Sister Agatha observe with irony. Despite a long sequence of fantasy induced by drugs, although the demon of Ken Russell was much more extravagant, the film is relatively petty in the fur department, which makes its reputation as a mockery a mockery. This is a serious job that deserves the rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation.
