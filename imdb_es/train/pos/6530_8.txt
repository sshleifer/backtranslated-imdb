The last time I read a Nancy Drew book about 20 years ago, it is likely that much of my memory of the fictional character is flawed. From what I collected, the books were presented to me at a time when teenage detectives were popular with children growing up at that time (for me, the 80s and early 90s), with Hardy Boys, Famous Five and , of course, "Carolyn Keene" is Nancy Drew among the most famous. I still remember those hardback books with very old cover artwork, usually quite heavy (for a child), and the thickness of the book is perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large print. <br /> <br /> Well, the character has received some updates along the way, as I remember that the later Nancy Drew books of my sister became less thick, softcover, with a more modern Nancy and Elegant illustrated on the cover. I can not remember if those stories were the same as the old hardback ones, but I suppose these books, written by ghosts, are quite updated for the times. <br /> <br /> In this release of Nancy Drew's Warner Brothers, the character is undoubtedly updated to adapt to the times, but somehow the writers Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen kept their sensibility in the small town of 50s, preserving the charm and flavor that erm, people like me, would appreciate. Her sense of fashion, her primacy and kindness, even some peculiar behavioral traits that make her, well, Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> His family background remains more or less the same, living with his single father Carson Drew (Tate Donovan), who moves with his daughter and he to the big city for a better job opportunity, and to wean her daughter in the city of River Heights. Mom is just a distant memory, and the maid makes a cameo. But what made Nancy Drew work is the casting of Emma Roberts in the lead role. Niece of her famous aunt Julia, she also has that cheerful attitude, that unmistakable red hair and megawatt smile. Your Nancy Drew, while at first seems to rub you incorrectly, will actually grow on you. And in almost what I thought could be a discarded scene of Pretty Woman, she made the characters enter a classy store with almost opposite reactions. <br /> <br /> While dad Carson Drew struggles to get Nancy out of her detective In the environment and to assimilate into the normal life of teenagers, trust that Nancy will find herself living in a house whose owner, an Hollywood guy, he was killed under suspicious circumstances. The mysterious solution is her comforting meal when she finds herself marginalized from the local fraternity, and not in a short time we take her with her to the adventure on the big screen. <br /> <br /> There's nothing too Black Dahlia about Crime and Mystery, and instead it's a fairly simple piece for Nancy to solve, between a friendship with Corky (Josh Flitter), a chubby friend of the school, and the pacification of the jealous boyfriend Ned (Max Thieriot), while hiding the truth of his additional curricular activities. His father. The story is full of cheesy fun and an old sentimentality that charms, and together, it becomes something like Scooby-Doo. With a minimum of violence and without major shootings or explosions, this is a serious genre that is clearly marked with the "chick flick" alert. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the film will generate a new generation of fans, revive the memories of the ancients, and probably, just probably, could trigger a new fashion trend with sports moccasins.
