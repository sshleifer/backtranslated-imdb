This movie is unusual and strange, and it's almost unusual and strange in a very good way. I give this short a 7 only because it is so unique and out of the ordinary, but most of the time it seems that it is being strange just for being strange. If the film had managed to integrate its most bizarre moments into something like a plot, it would have been really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that it seems that the creators have come together. of garbage on spatulas, then I threw a lot more garbage that sounded as if it sounds funny coming from the mouth of a spatula. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth checking out, but it's not the best option. By any stretch of creative wild creations.
