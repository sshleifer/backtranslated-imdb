['I have to be honest, I have not seen a film as solid as DOG BITE DOG in a long time. I&#39;m a big fan of the &quot;old school&quot; CATIII movies of the late 80&#39;s and mid-90&#39;s, and I&#39;ve heard that &quot;style&quot; of movies is coming back with movies like this, and GONG TAU by Herman Yau ( that until now I had not seen ...), so I was very interested in trying some of these latest wave CATIII movies. Did this film live up to my expectations? Absolutely, but not in the way I imagined. <br /><br /> The story follows a young Thai hit man, animal, witty and virtually unstoppable with a somewhat vague story that comes to Hong Kong to complete a &quot;mission&quot;. Due to some bad luck, he is quickly identified by a mischievous copy (which exudes many of the same qualities as our hit man), and is quickly arrested and captured. However, this state of affairs does not last long, since the nameless murderer escapes his captors and quickly shows the local police that he should not take it lightly. The hunt is underway, and a game of cat and mouse occurs between the police and the &quot;mad dog&quot; (as the police refer to him). Along the way, Mad Dog inadvertently befriends a young girl with little activity, and a bond is formed between them when she helps him out of a difficult situation. The initial bet continues to increase, since the only goal of Mad Dog is to leave Hong Kong and return to Thailand by all means necessary, and the police are still trying to attract him alive ... <br /><br /> I could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and completely layered film, but I do not want to reveal too much. I saw DOG BITE DOG without knowing anything about the premise, and I think it is the kind of movie that is definitely best appreciated that way. As for the comparisons with older style CATIII movies ... there are some similarities. DOG BITE DOG has some hyperviolent moments reminiscent of &quot;good times&quot;, but it&#39;s never as sleazy or dirty as the old school classics like THE UNTOLD STORY or RED TO KILL. Where the main intention of many of the older films of CATIII was &quot;to impact&quot;: DOG BITE DOG is a much more thoughtful and complete production (although it is not to take away ANYTHING from those CATIII films that I appreciate so much ...). This film is much more &quot;emotional&quot; than exploitative, and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds, the audience begins to link and identify with both sides. There really are no clear &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; types, since Mad Dog shows moments of extreme compassion, and the police are inclined towards extremely unorthodox methods to try to develop the murderer. There&#39;s also no nudity / sex in this movie, which is a typical feature of the older CATIII movies. Personally, I would compare DOG BITE DOG more with Park&#39;s SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE or perhaps the PANGICIOUS BANGKOK of brother Pang, since both films combined extremely emotional nuances with strong and unbreakable action and violence. Once again, there is almost nothing that I did not like about this movie. The acting is uninterrupted, the cinematography is crisp and well made, and the whole film skilfully combines several different elements successfully in a way that is not seen very often. Is this movie (and others like it ...) the &quot;rebirth&quot; of the film CATIII? Not exactly, but it&#39;s a very solid movie that&#39;s worth checking out ... 9/10']
