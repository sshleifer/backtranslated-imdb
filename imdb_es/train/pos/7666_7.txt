Two wizards fight in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as Kabal) trying to destroy the Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid) trying to save him. "Doctor Mordrid" is a fantastic fantasy rate that offers a lot of Cheese. The plot is quite silly and the gore is completely absent, but the film is very short and entertaining. Therefore, if you have enough time to kill, take a look at this. My rating: 7 out of 10.
