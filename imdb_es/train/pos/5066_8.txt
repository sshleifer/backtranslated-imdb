I know some people think the movie is boring, but I do not agree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the film and I think that leaving part of Archie's life a mystery captured his humanity. I do not think that the purpose of a good biography should be the detail of someone's life, but the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what is more fascinating than someone reinventing himself so successfully? "Men become what they dream, you have dreamed well". Good job for Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stood out as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more films.
