When I rented this movie, I thought I was going to see a horror movie. However, there is little horror in this typical mysterious drama of the 70s directed by the strange James T. Flocker. The attractive Matt Boston takes the picture with its excellent performance and the strange atmosphere typical of Flocker films is present.
