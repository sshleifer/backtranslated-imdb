Finally, a good film by Modesty Blaise was released there, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the "real" story. I admit it's a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop on your track and eliminate all your expectations. Then you will realize that it is a story very similar to the original one made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story to tell how Modestia became the magnificent person she is. It is not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real story. Some things could have been better, but when you can not forget the horrible movie of '66, then this is a great movie. So, are you a fan? Sit back, relax and enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story for Modesty to tell his story.
