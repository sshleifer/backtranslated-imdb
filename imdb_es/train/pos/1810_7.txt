I can understand why some people like this movie and why others do not. For me, however, I like it a lot, even if I've noticed some good bits and not so impressive. The animation was really excellent, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best is Anne-Marie, expressed by the late Judith Barsi. (I was physically sick when I read what happened to her) In addition, Carface is a very convincing villain, especially expressed by the wonderful Vic Tayback. (In particular, I loved the "imbeciles I'm surrounded by imbeciles") and, along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat, is probably the most memorable of all the villains of Don Bluth. Charlie and Itchy just lacked the same brightness, but I loved King Gator and his song. Part of the movie is very disturbing, like "You can never come back", by Annabelle, which still scares me. Unfortunately, there were some bits that I did not like so much. History had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered the same problem. There were also some dark scenes, which small children would find annoying, but the ending is very moving. However, the biggest flaw was the rather soft songs and the way they were sung. None of them in particular stands out, except for "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives", and Burt Reynolds can not sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing. In general, a movie that can be seen, that could have been more, but it is definitely memorable, and I would definitely see it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
