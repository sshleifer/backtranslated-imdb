A River Runs Through is one of those films that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated. The performance is wonderful and discreet, with every gesture, smile and head movement with meaning. Brad Pitt gives a radiant performance and Tom Skerrit is powerful as the father preacher. The film moves like a river, you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows, but in the end it's worth it.
