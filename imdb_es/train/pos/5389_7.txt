Something like a very primitive episode of "General Hospital" set in a natal room (and one for difficult cases in that), this fast programmer has a satisfactory emotional impact, mainly because Eric Linden, as the young and anguished husband of The plot principal, it is so palpably a disaster, and so rightly so. His wife, Loretta Young, is taken to the courtroom at the beginning of a sentence of 20 years in prison for having freed a libertine who probably expected it; Mrs. Young, as always, does nothing to discourage the sympathy of the audience, and is too good to be true, although sympathetic and charming to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and the relationships with the other girls in the neighborhood form the heart of the film, and the result, not entirely happy, feels good. Aline MacMahon, "one of the few perfect actresses in the movies," in the words of film historian David Thomson, radiates warmth and authority as a head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a new mother of twins who do not want too much, arrives in Croon "Frankie and Johnny" like a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another secondary plot, and he can show more range than Warners usually allowed. His scale and rhythm are modest, and the panic of Linden's expectant dad stays with you for days; This type of paper is often played to laugh, but it is a young child terrified in trouble and very persuasive.
