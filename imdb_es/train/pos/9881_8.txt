In West Hollywood, those trail hands were a rough group that, when they arrived in the city, were quite resilient. After all, driving trails was a lonely business on the day before the railroads reached all parts of the US. UU <br /> <br /> The servants who worked for the trail chief Gil Favor played by Eric Fleming were no different. But Fleming was a man of all businesses, had a job to do and hired a high-level team to do it. <br /> <br /> With the long term of Rawhide and the fact that regular customers stayed with him for the most part, we got to meet all the breeders at some point. Some lines of the story centered around all of them, although most were with the character of Fleming and Clint Eastwood, Rowdy Yates, the number 2 man with the pack. <br /> <br /> The west image of Clint Eastwood was shaped by Rawhide, It's a shame these are not shown more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. If this had been an NBC program, this would have been done in colors like Bonanza and would run as often as those programs. We could see much more a man who became a legend of the movement. <br /> <br /> Ironically, it was Eric Fleming who left the program before it closed to make movies. He did some of them and hoped that the show would give him a profitable movie name. Unfortunately, he was killed in a place in the movie making an action movie, drowned in a river. If he had lived, it could have become a name like Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> Clint took over as trail chief last season and then the show ended his career. And, of course, it became the icon it is today and not just in the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a strong western that had some tough guys. No frills in this, these were cowboys who worked only doing a job and fighting against the elements and situations in which they launched each year. <br /> <br /> They really do not do TV shows like this anymore. What a pity.
