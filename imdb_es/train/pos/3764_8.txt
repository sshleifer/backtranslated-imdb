Well, I admit it, I'm a fool and from time to time I love a really silly comedy. While I've seen more Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut movies than virtually anyone on the planet, I still have a weakness for a silly comedy that does not attempt to be sophisticated, but is simply fun. Some of the movies that come to mind immediately are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, UHF, START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANGE BREW and Bill and Ted movies. They all lack snobbery, but only a zombie or professional film critic can be upset. <br /> <br /> While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted movie, it's still a lot of fun. Also, unlike the original, it actually seems to improve with repeated visualization. I remember that I did not love the movie the first time I saw it, possibly because the other movie sets such a high standard for laughter. But, every time I see him again, I am amazed by all the great moments, especially those related to Grim Reaper. And, by the way, this mower is so different from Bergman's in THE SEVENTH SEAL as you can get! In addition to many laughs, this film presents excellent music, a way that is better than the first movie. The anthem of the kiss at the end is great, but so is the rest of the hard rock melodies, as long as you're not an old assassin like De Nomolos. Great viewing for children and adults alike.
