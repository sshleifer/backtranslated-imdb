TRAVEL DE CAROL is a pleasure to watch for many reasons. Clara Lago's performance is simply amazing for someone so young, and she is one of those special actors who can say a lot with facial expressions. The director Imanol Urbibe presents a film adjusted and controlled without interruption in continuity, thus promoting the plot at a constant pace with enough suspense for one to wonder what the scene of the nest will bring. The script of Angel Garcia Roldan is the best storytelling, which seems to be the main objective of the films, after all. The plot is unpredictable, however, events as they unravel are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film is telling a story of the Spanish Civil War that affected people. It was an important event of the twentieth century, but almost no American knows it. In fact, in 40 years of university teaching, I averaged about one student per semester who had even heard of it, let alone anyone who could say anything about it, and the overwhelming number of students were academics of merit, all of which speak to the enormous amount of censorship in American education. So, in a way, this movie is a good way to start a study of that event, keeping in mind that when a thread is drawn, a large part of the story is unraveled. The appreciation of this film is, therefore, directly related to the amount of knowledge one has. Seeing this movie as another adult film is the one that completely misses the movie. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of the film: acting, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and art: on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for average and 1 for help of needs CAROL'S JOURNEY is above average in all counts, except the dialogue that is rated as average. The LEI average for this movie is 9.3, increased to 10 when compared to the IMDb scale. I recommend this movie for all ages.
