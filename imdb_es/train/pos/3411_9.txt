This is easily a 9. Michel Serrault, best known for his comedic roles in the first part of his acting career, does an amazing job, even disturbingly surprising, to personify Dr. Petiot, a legendary French serial killer. <br /> <br /> It's so believable in every moment of the movie, that the actor disappears completely behind the character; only the best achieve this feat, and when they do, it is only in a handful of parties at best. <Br /> <br /> The whole story (a true story that happened in 20th century France) is so powerful, so sinister, that it becomes a very strong film that one remembers for a long, long time.
