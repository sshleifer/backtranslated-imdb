Wonderful movie, one of the best horror films of the 70s. She is realistic environments and environments. As usual the usual negative comments were inevitable. I have noticed that most horror movies of a certain period often fail to reach sufficiency. Obviously, because most horror movies are old and must be denigrated, it's like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of the musical critics here. <br /> <br /> Before reading the review, I already knew what the final judgment was. In the movie a good gift because 10 is very well done. Raines reads quite well and the film as the way it was produced reminds me of many Kubrick films. It really impresses. Excellent movie really. I consider a cinematographic anthology of the 70s.
