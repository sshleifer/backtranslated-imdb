Just as Al Gore surprised us with his documentary film "An Inconvenient Truth," painfully honest and cleverly presented, directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield also remind us that it's time to improve our lifestyle to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a wake-up call that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures throughout the world. Al Gore showed us the grim future of planet Earth by presenting concrete facts supported by documented examples through long but always interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different but equally powerful way to achieve this. They do not present us with a future representation of what could happen on our planet if we do not radically change things, but rather show us the genuine beauty of the planet Earth in all its amazing glory. We see places that we knew existed, but we never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide range of the most extraordinary places, such as abandoned deserts, giant forests full of fauna and flora and icy landscapes as far as the eye can see. And in all those immensely different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the kind of film that had to be made, in combination with Al Gore's, in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to intrude. The voiceover of Patrick Stewart is always relaxing and, therefore, very well done, although at first it sounded like he was watching an X-men movie instead! The cinematography is probably the most remarkable of this documentary. Sometimes: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera really had to film all those charming images. <br /> <br /> In summary: this is definitely a must see for all. As it concerns every person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is that I never thought that our planet was so amazingly beautiful.
