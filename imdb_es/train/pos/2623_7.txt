In fact, I like the original, and this movie has its ups and downs. Here are some: <br /> <br /> Ups: the majority of the original voice cast returned. <br /> <br /> Downs: I did not like the voice of Timon's mother. I know she made a voice in The Simpsons, but that show is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We could see Simba as a "teenager". <br /> <br /> Downs: They squandered it with a slug contest between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was Rafiki who told Timon about "Hakuna Matata". <br /> <br /> Downs: How did Pumba find out about this? <br /> <br /> Ups: Songs again. (Some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music). <br /> <br /> Downs: But stupid songs. (a.k.a. Timon's solo.) <br /> <br /> In general, this is a pretty good movie. I would recommend it for fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, you probably do not like this one. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
