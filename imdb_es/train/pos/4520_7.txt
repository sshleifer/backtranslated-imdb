This comedy, which is a bit too long and stretches across the top towards the end, is absolutely charming, never condescending or ridiculing the problems of a "mighty man" who likes to wear women's clothes at night. <br /> <Julie Walters is beautiful as always, but Adrian Pasdar is absolutely believable and steals the movie. He (she) is absolutely beautiful in high heels and silk stockings.
