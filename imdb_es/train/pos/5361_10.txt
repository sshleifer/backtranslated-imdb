If you were raised on a game diet, you will understand that gradually you need a bigger and better solution. Well, in the ordinary man's world, your needs will be satisfied. Because in this game program, the prisoners compete for freedom and the final prize: their own lives. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was a parody in the gut that numbs the mind we see every day. It's not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but overall it's a very good movie. The underlying idea that the Television Corporations will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very credible and very well represented in this film. Of course, there are the usual Arnie phrases, my favorite is when it is about to be catapulted into the playground, the game show host asks "Any last word?" Arnie says: "Yes, I'll be back", but the host says "Only in one replay" and presses the eject button. I give this movie a 10 for pure originality. I must have seen it 30 or more times. The only film apart from the Die Hard series that I saw this often !! <br /> <br /> In summary, do not think for a minute that you are the owner of the TV. It's your owner .....
