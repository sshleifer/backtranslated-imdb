First of all, I did not know what to expect when I started the video. <br /> <br /> Every time someone brings a cult movie genre and adapts it to the present, something is inexplicably lost in the translation. <br /> <br /> That is not the case here. This movie just starts on the right path. It is part of the family territory, but it manages to take it to the top as well. Crockzilla scene to someone? That has to be seen, and just try to keep the face serious. This film takes some of the old and funny classics of cult cinema and manages to mix it perfectly in a modern production. It is good to see that someone is filling the need in this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
