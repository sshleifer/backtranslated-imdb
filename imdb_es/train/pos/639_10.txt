This is a good family show with a great cast of actors. It's a good break from the blitz reality show lately. Nor is there anything similar on television right now, unless you consider that Juana de Arcadia is similar because she also has a teenage lead character. Anyway, Clubhouse is worth watching because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of sympathy and ingenuity that is attractive without being too sweet and tender. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the rest of the main cast members, and each is excellent in his role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister, Betsy; She is a good pill, but she still cares for her mother and brother, although she hates to show it. It may take some episodes to really discover your legs, but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows that will be presented in a long time, so take a look at the people. He will be glad he did!
