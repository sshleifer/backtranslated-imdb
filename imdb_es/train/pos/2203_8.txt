I also loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 years old and my family always saw this show. My favorite character was played by Marion Lorne as a person "aunt" quite stammering, clumsy and very friendly. I can still remember your "ubba bubba um um" type comments as I would try to say something important. And then, when he came back and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched, it was a great casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I remember seeing Walter Matthau, whose career I continued as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question if someone can verify: was the title or final credits the "Swedish Rhapsody" by Hugo Alfven? Every time I listen to their reproduction on my classic radio station here in Southern California, it brings back memories of the image of Mr. Peepers who turned his back to the camera. I'm not even sure if this image in my mind's eye is correct.
