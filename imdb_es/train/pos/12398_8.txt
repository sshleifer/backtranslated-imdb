What was always missing with the Matrix story was how things came to be in the real world. Do not say more, because this part of the story covered most of the bases. What was really interesting was how political it was, maybe even a low blow in the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things in which man could think of fighting the robotic horde, which were nothing more than servants of humanity. What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of ​​the unknown. We, as humans, tend to fall into that trap quite often, letting the lack of logic and thought reach us because people can not believe otherwise. Well represented and together, this is a true testimony of how illogical humans can be.
