Maybe I identify with this movie because I live in New York and I suffer from bad insomnia, but whatever it is, I should praise the filmmaker for an incredible job. to do what she did without a budget ... wow, that's all I can say. really very well As if he had not spent money on this film and still impressed me. I would definitely suggest taking a look if you can. a great direction, a fantastic score and, of course, a script that will hit you in the ass. Look at it.
