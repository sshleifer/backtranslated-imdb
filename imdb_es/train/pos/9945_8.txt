The first is the first! This is not an action movie although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it with American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable, win a game or tournament beyond what is expected! In this case, it's not football or baseball, it's Taekwondo! At first, these street thugs seem to be useless! But we will soon discover that they do not want to be bullies and really achieve something in life! It's good to see them fight and train! I was surprised at how funny this movie was! From the beginning to the end you will laugh! The young Korean actors are very convincing! Go see this wonderful and good movie!
