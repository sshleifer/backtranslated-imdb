Seeing this several times as a child was quite an experience 15 years ago, and now that I have found it again, I still have a cinematic experience like few others. If it is risky, it is a great sample of morality and life lessons recommended to see as a family with young children. While he still remains an adult, I was lucky to have learned from it many times over the years. Trying to find him today is quite difficult. . . But believe me, it's worth it regardless of age. Anime fans, especially, will find that this is a great entry for Masami Hata's filmography. With stunning works of art and unique designs, "Chirin No Suzu" represents a worthwhile experience. While some of the lyrical songs are not as good when recorded in English, the musical score is captivating. But even the voice acting is much better than much released today. Sadly, it was sold out in the mid-1980s of RCA Columbia Home Video, and I have not received any new format releases, to my knowledge, at least in the United States. Look closely and you will be quite satisfied! It is an artistic, intense, pleasant and important landmark in Japanese animation.
