This is a good example of a film that, despite the low rating, is worth watching. The story is interesting and it's not long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin catches your attention. The performance is first class and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it feels as if the director can not decide between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller's interpretation of the respectful and timid English law with S.M. Hidden magazines in the bedroom creates a lot of moments to laugh! Like the look in Nicole Kidman's eyes when she offers John her first contact with intimacy in a long time ... At other times, the actors, and especially Nicole Kidman, give this comedy a dramatically expert touch .
