I like Peter Sellers, most of the time. I had never seen him portray a high-class Brit to this movie. He does it quite well, though you see pieces of Inspector Clouseau in the mix. It does not become interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected young Hawn to offer such a solid performance. His time was great and his expressions were priceless. The way in which she, in turn, knocks down the lustful character of Sellers and seduces him, is beautiful to watch. A verbal combat like the one that I have rarely seen in a movie of that time. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the movie DOES fall. It's worth disappointing just to see the first sixty. Hawn is naked for a few glorious seconds from the beginning. Enjoy it ...
