A short subject of youth. <br /> <br /> A teenager, embarrassed by his fear of dogs, runs away from home. The abandoned barbet he finds helps him change his mind. <br /> <br /> PARDON MY PUPS is a fun little movie in which Shirley Temple steals all her scenes as the hero's lively infant sister. The opening gag, which deals with enuresis, is in bad taste, but is quickly forgotten. Highlights: the climatic fisticuffs, which look impressively realistic. <br /> <br /> Often, overlooked or neglected today, short one- and two-reel topics were useful for studies as important training camps for new or developing talents, both in front and behind of the camera. The dynamic to create a successful short track was completely different from that of a feature film, something like writing a short story first class instead of a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and schedules and able to portray a wide range of materials, the short subjects were the perfect complement for the feature films of the studios.
