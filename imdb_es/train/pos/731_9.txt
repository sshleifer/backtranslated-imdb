This movie is so funny !!! The performance is WONDERFUL, the Ramones are sensual, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is what every high school student dreams of doing in their school. I loved the soundtrack, as well as the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, you will love this movie. This movie is a little "grease" esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs that are sung are pleasant; You may even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is over. This musical is number two in musicals for me (second to the blues brothers). But, please, do not think of it as a musical commentary; Seeing that the songs are so enjoyable, it is difficult to say that a carefully choreographed scene is taking place. I think of this movie as a comedy with nuances of romance. They will remind you what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you will remember your old high school days after watching this movie. Highly recommended both for the family (as it is very young but also for adults, as there are many jokes that are more fun with age and experience).
