This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I would recommend it to anyone. In my list of favorite movies (mental mind, mind), the only ones that are on par are movies like The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. <br /> <br /> I can really relate to The main character of Jess. At the beginning of the film, she is a shy girl with a bit of strange history, who has many more friends who are boys than girls. She really sucks you in her life. Nor can I complain about the performance of the protagonist, or anyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> Football was interesting to see even for someone like me who has no idea of ​​the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is very cute and it did not make me blush too much! One thing that really succeeded was the Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indians and there are many colorful indigenous conventions throughout the film that provide a very interesting cultural vision, as well as everything else. The Indians are fun too! Essentially, this is a coming of age film about how to choose the path you want and fight for it. <br /> <br /> Feel that good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this movie. They are fun, refreshing and make you feel good! ^ _ ~
