This is a small criminal drama that includes a lot in its execution time of 65 minutes. It has all the right ingredients: a mysterious corpse, a tired middle-aged policeman, Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his rookie partner Tobin (John Miles), a murderer in the shade and even a loving interest in the Tobin in the form of Botany Mary (Patricia Wright) who helps solve the crime. There is also an excellent end of shootings that takes place in the yard of a stone cutter. <br /> <br /> Beware of a big stupid near the beginning of this movie, where Lieutenant Corrigan refers to the dead woman as 'Tatooed Tilly' BEFORE the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo (confusing,? Hey?). Later, when Tobin is chasing the murderer through the backyards, he is suddenly shown to be going in the wrong direction at a given moment, no wonder he has not caught him!
