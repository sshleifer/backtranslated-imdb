This film might not put the Catholic Church in the best light, but it is telling a story based on real events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, is pleasant and attractive. Sometimes people and groups do things that at that moment seem to be the right ones, but in retrospect, they do not look as good as they once did. "A Love Divided" tells the story of a family, yes, incorporates religion, but in reality it is a family, and the ability of the family to stay together no matter what is presented. This movie is also based on real events, which does not mean that this story, scene by scene, is true, but if you look at news articles from that period of time, you could see that none of the churches handled the incident in One Way that helped the family. Both churches are to blame here, the Catholic Church for forcing such regulation on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with it, and the Protestant church for telling the mother that she should only obey her husband and the priest . and not put a fight. In this case both disappointed this family. I think the film does a good job of showing this struggle in the church as well as in the family. In no way, the form or the form is to belittle the Catholic Church; on the contrary, it shows how an incident can change the course of the ideas of that religion and how a person can have a much wider effect than just itself.
