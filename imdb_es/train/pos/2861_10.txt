I love this program and my 11 year old daughter and I LOVE seeing it together. It teaches good old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time). It's also fun to make fun of ... you know, rewind and insert your own dialog box, instead of the actors'. <br /> <br /> I have my DVR configured to record all the episodes and it happened that it catches the end of an episode (just before the next one starts ... so I do not know what episode it was) but there was an error of sequence absolutely TERRIBLE! Adam had given the Sheriff Coffee a small sample of "leather," which came off the coat of some outlaw when he tried to escape, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy had the coat on, so he put it on his desk and placed the sample right where it had been ripped off. The sample was EXACTLY rectangular ... which I think would be almost impossible to tear off a piece of leather (Naugahyde after the 1950s? Yes. Leather? I do not think so). Well, the sample lined up perfectly and the mystery was solved. <br /> <br /> Not 10 seconds later on the scene, we see the coat again, still on Roy's desk. But this time, the sample is more similar to the shape of North Carolina and is now in a COMPLETELY different place in the coat (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which was hit in the center of the layer). Swatch) is gone ... as is the seam in the coat. My daughter enjoyed a good laugh while we played the short scene again and again! It is paramount for youtube, I tell you! <br /> <br /> We still LOVE the program totally and the sequence errors make it very fun!
