The show is about two sisters who live together. Holly being the youngest has some teenage problems, on the other hand, her sister Val has a job, boyfriend, fianc√©e problems like most of the women on the planet. They try to support each other, sometimes they make mistakes, but they do not give up and continue. And the show is also friendship. The priorities in life. I loved this show so much. It's fun and the actors are very good. I am very sad that the show is over. I still see the reruns from time to time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to comedy, but she plays very well. She is one of the actresses that I like to see. I like the relationship of Vince and Holly, they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he shows up. With Tina, Holly found a true friend and I really like them to leave. Lauren's character is very funny and she is a natural talent. I would like to see it more. This show really takes you and makes you laugh. I hope the show is not over.
