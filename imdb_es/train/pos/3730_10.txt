If you want to watch a movie and you feel good watching it, then Tigerland is the movie for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The perfect scenes of this movie look so real; It's almost like a documentary about something that happened in real life but with drama. Boy, I tell you ... the REAL drama actually "fought" in one of the scenes (getting the DVD to hear the comment is not obvious). I see this movie as a group of desperate young people trying to escape an unfortunate fate, after watching Save Ryan, I appreciate what an "unfortunate destiny" is, and I know exactly how men feel in the movie. . I see this movie as a cross between "Stand By Me" and "Saving Private Ryan". What do men do when they are in a situation that is "difficult" in real life? Some men go crazy, some men cry, others men with fists, others consume drugs, others sleep at random with prostitutes who ruthlessly try to eradicate the meaning of love from their lives, others try to get rid of pain, others jump off buildings or bridges , others feel guilty and others feel so agonized that it makes them so sick that they physically collapse. This movie has all those desperate emotions in a ball. But do not get me wrong, it's not a depressing movie, it's realistic, it's a very humorous movie, Bozz (the character of Collin) lights up, and besides that, there are about 5 actresses in the movie. ; I'll let you find out what they're there for! With dialogues, war / action sequences, perfect scenes together with the right music; This movie has it all, as I said: from top to bottom. I do not know why Tigerland is very uncredited. The best thing about owning the film is that on the cover it says with big bold print "The best movie of the year", and there is nothing less than that. Keep the rare gems coming from Hollywood, 10/10.
