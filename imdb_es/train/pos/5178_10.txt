Before Tuscan Sky, I saw the tender performance of Diane Lane in this film otherwise than in a movie. Campers are invited to their youth camp and experience it as adults. Each of the returnees seems to be looking for something they lost, which makes it so realistic. Maybe you had to be a camper to really get it, but in the words of a character who noticed that all his clothes were wet "this is so camp!" From the practical jokes and the fights for the couple, to the terrifying lady at lunch and the bell at dawn ... it's an amplifier. Once the exciting activities now seem mundane. An excellent ensemble cast makes the best of one-dimensional roles and makes them credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when he fell in love with her for the first time!) The beautiful landscape, the bright colors, the comic music (including the variations of Hello Muddah) and a comic turn of the famous director Sam Raimi makes it a movie that you can take out again and again, like looking for an old friend.
