I have "Things to come" in D.V.D. and it's very clear compared to my VHS version. Audio is fair, but sometimes it can be difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie so much that I looked for a copy of the book and found it. He gave details of why some things happened. The best things in the movie are the little things that I did not notice at first. For example, John Cabal playing with a toy airplane at a Christmas party, as if he were a dive bomber, overcoming the power of the sea by naming a battleship, "Dinosuar". Ships sunk by air power, an undeclared enemy corner the planes. Swept flying wing aircraft. Strong rolls for women throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There's more, watch the movie to enjoy them.
