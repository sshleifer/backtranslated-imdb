Although I was too young to remember the first projection of the series (being only a baby), I later caught repetitions of it on television in the late 80s, just when I was interested in the war and in all its aspects. It was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests, telling stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then I have devoured many books and have seen many television series about the era of the Second World War, with mixed opinions. In general, British television stations are very good at producing them, as The World At War can easily attest, with many jewels created by both the BBC and independent companies. I highly recommend titles like "The Nazis: A Warning of the Story", "Blitz" and the BBC series about Dunkirk. "Britain At War In Color", with its complementary series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are of a very high standard. The World At War is, by far, the best and, despite its age, never fails to comply. There will always be new revelations about the war that will continue to appear and obviously are not included in the series and, of course, World War II was carried out on such a large canvas that producing a series with EVERY detail would require more time and money. then any other, even if such a company were even possible. What I feel I should say to those who condemn it is that The World At War can not do that physically as a series, but it can certainly prompt you to investigate more and make it more enjoyable. That certainly worked for me: now I have a very complete library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Recommend to anyone with even a passing interest. The series was so well done that it would be difficult for them not to agree that it is a quality and highly informative program.
