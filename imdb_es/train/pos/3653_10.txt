Why does a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley star in this common movie? The cast offers a good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a child without a mother and Justin Whalin, a boy who has been eternally diminished by his annoyance), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original. I can not believe that a movie like this one has been produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer): are you crazy ??? !!!
