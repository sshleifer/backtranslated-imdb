Something surprised me about this movie, it was really original. It was not the same old recycled garbage that leaves Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on video because I did not even know it before I saw it in my local video store. If you see this movie available, rent it, you will not regret it. The suspense accumulates everywhere and the end of the turn is excellent. <br /> <br />
