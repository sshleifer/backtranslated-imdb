One winter day, December 28, 1986, two boring 14-year-olds contract a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, it looks interesting," "Who is this Jackie Chan?", "I've never heard of him." Two hours later, after seeing the movie, stunned, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and very out of the pocket of collecting JC films!), The film still traps me like no other. Ok, maybe I have a weakness for that since it was my "first" (Cannonball Run does not count!) JC, but it's an excellent movie. It has all the classic elements of JC, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some comments say it's dated, it was done in 1985, of course it's dated! But then they must also Jaws, Casablanca, sing in the rain and the godfather !! Without movies like Police Story, where would Hollywood action be today? PS sets standards, many scenes have been stolen for use in other movies. To fully appreciate it, you should see it on the wide screen, otherwise you will lose a lot of the movie (yes, you really fall off the bus and turn the corner!). If you have not done it yet, SEE THIS MOVIE NOW! <br /> <br />
