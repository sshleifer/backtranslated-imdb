If you like animal movies, this movie will like you. My wife likes animals and animal movies, she especially likes the parrot in this movie. It is geared towards children, but I laughed at most of the humor. The French fashion character made me laugh, and adds balance to the script. It's a Disney movie, with its happy, happy and familiar appeal, but I like to leave the theater with a positive attitude.
