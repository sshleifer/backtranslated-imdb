I happily admit that I am a fool for a beautiful movie, and the camera movements and angles sufficiently inventive may be enough to maintain my interest in a fairly long film. However, it is not the length of Gojoe, even though it has some of the most remarkable cinematographic images that I have seen since the piece of the Korean MUSA period. However, Gojoe offers much more than beautiful images (like MUSA ... does not imply a contrast): his second great strength is his excellent performance and a fascinating story with a very dark philosophy. I must admit that I was not quite sure what point I was trying to make at the end, but it definitely causes some thoughts along the way. Vagos, but definitely thoughts: p <br /> <br /> A department in which the movie could have been better is the action. There is a tremendous amount of bloodshed in the film, but the action is filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups, and often hidden by foreground objects. It creates some very intense and impressive visual effects, but it would have been nice to see some more real moves, something to make it more believable that the villains could just go through entire armies sweeping everyone. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is definitely one of the most interesting and beautiful movies I've seen for quite some time. Recommended!
