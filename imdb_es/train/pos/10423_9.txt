['Yes, Be My Love was the success of Mario Lanza to fame and even today it is popular. His voice was strong and firm, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. Having read Kostelanitz&#39;s book that wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that constant practice and vocal lessons became the visionary Caruso a Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did an excellent job in history, but the story is not entirely true; Blame Hollywood! I used to practice singing their songs years ago, and I became pretty good until I lost my voice due to emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Reaching the high note of Be My Love is not easy; But beautiful!']
