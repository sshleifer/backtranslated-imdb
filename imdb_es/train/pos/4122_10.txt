Surely I would like to see a resurrection of an updated series of Seahunt with the technology they have today. I would wake up the emotion of the children. I grew up on black and white television and Seahunt with Gunsmoke was my hero every week. My vote for a return of a new search at sea. We need a change of pace on television and this would work for a world of underwater adventures. By the way, thanks for an exit like this to see many points of view on television and the many movies. So, anyway, I think I have what I want to say. It would be good to read more points about hunting at sea. If my rhymes were 10 lines, would you let me send them or leave me out? in doubt and have him leave, if this is so, I must leave, so let's do it.
