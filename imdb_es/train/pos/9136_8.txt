['This is NOT a film as bad as some critics and, as the summary says on the IMDB page of this film. Why? First, the fact that in 1984 the filmmakers dared to confront, as one of the elements of the plot, the problem of domestic violence, so critics who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of their own. the main points! Second, without the plot element of Prince&#39;s cinematic relationship with his abusive father, the musical climax would not work as well as he does, so those critics who say that only music is good have lost, once more, one of the points. - specifically, WHY it&#39;s so good ... because all the music in this movie has a plot background that makes music more effective. Third, give a break to this movie! For producers and film directors for the first time, this is not so bad! There are much worse movies out there for accomplished movie people! And finally, critics who say that music is &quot;good&quot; have also overlooked the point: check Prince&#39;s range of stylistic musical treatments, variety, musicality and theatrical performance, which is truly one of a kind . go musically where no one else was going during the 1980s, and with a style that is seen in the work of other artists (clothes and movement: what costume elements came first, those of Michael Jackson or Prince?) Also, see if he can detect the extended fingers sweeping before the eyes that Prince makes in this film, long before Quentin Tarentino&#39;s &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; Like the sum of its parts, it&#39;s not a bad movie at all.']
