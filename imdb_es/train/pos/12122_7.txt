The movie can be great. I just saw him last night, but I feel unable to give an honest opinion because I read the book first. The book is much better than the movie that disappointed me in the movie. If you plan to watch "Of Human Bondage", do not read the book beforehand. On the other hand, the book is very good and contains much more than the love story that Phillip has with Mildred, which can still be enjoyed after watching the film. I do not make this claim lightly. Average reading a book every 4 days, and read authors as disparate as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" gets my vote as one of the ten best novels ever written.
