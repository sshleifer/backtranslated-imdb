"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the great films of director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it is replete with an excellent cast of the best actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. They are the kind of actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs. In fact, the movie itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood no longer does. (The creators of "You Have Got Mail" claim that their movie is a new version, but that is nothing more than a lot of self-inflated praise.) Anyway, if you feel affection for the romantic comedies of the 1940s, You will find "The store just around the corner" to be nothing short of wonderful. Equally good with repetitions of viewings. Enjoy!
