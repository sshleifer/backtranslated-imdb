['This movie is the best horror movie, bar-none. I love how Stanley simply throws women into the lake. I have been a fan of Judd Nelson&#39;s work for many years, and he surprised me. It is a mixture of horror, drama and romance, not so much comedy. His wicked and charming gaze captivated me right there. That look in his eyes, I will never forget it. There is something about him, I can not describe it.']
