I was not sure when I heard about this coming out. I was thinking about how silly Disney is getting. I was wrong. I thought it was very good I mean it's not the Lion King, but it's great to see another side from a certain point. It was very funny. Also, it was not one of those corny Disney sequels where the animation sucks, it was like the animation of The Lion King. The only thing that irritated me was the whole movie in the whole movie. Do not give anything, but you'll know what I'm talking about. It's also fun that it was great to have the majority of the original cast to go back. It was a very good movie about everything.
