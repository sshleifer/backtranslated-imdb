Titanic has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. He has his problems (what movies do not do), but still, it's nice. <br /> <br /> When I stumble over someone who asks me why I like the Titanic, I guess my first reaction is "wait a minute, do not you?" I know a lot of people who do not like this movie , and I'm not saying I do not see why. "The love story is too corny" well, yes, but is not it nice and touching? Okay, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like that does not really exist. But this is a movie, do not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that allows us to slide a bit in the fantasy for a while? The following complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, it's okay, in this movie, I agree that they do not act to their full potential. However, I think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors. Personally, I think both are very talented actors who, unfortunately, are very famous for a movie in which they are not incredible. But the roles assigned to them are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can take care of them a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as they might have expected. <br /> <br /> And finally, if someone is going to complain that they do not like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry, but why the hell? They went and saw a movie that is so clearly all these things? It's like people who complain that The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie, not because you do not like the genre, this IS a good movie. <br /> <br /> It deserves the Oscars, in particular, the Best Cinematography, which I consider to be the best I've seen in my life. seen in a movie, except in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know that some of the writings fail, like the constant screaming of the names of others throughout the film. The flashback part of the story can be pretty weak at times, but overall it's an incredible achievement to make the Titanic look so real and the sinking feels so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why a lot of people do not like this movie, but for the most part it comes down to not liking the fundamental idea, like it's a love story, instead of thinking that the movie itself is poorly constructed. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including the memories of the day it happened, and this movie is extremely accurate from the historical point of view, except for some faults. The only main ones I can find is that the pipes should be made of threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg seems quite unrealistic, since it is the scene in which they hit it. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romantic movies, but simply because it is an exceptional cinematic achievement, which leaves a feeling of horror at the realistic adaptation of the events.
