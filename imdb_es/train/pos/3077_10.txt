I missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on the ABC website during the summer of 2007. I am absolutely crazy about the program. I think the whole cast is excellent. It's one of my favorite shows. I just checked the alignment of the ABC program for this fall and I did not see it on the calendar. That is very sad. I hope they bring him back ... maybe they're waiting until Bridget Moynahan has her baby. Or is it just my illusion? <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments published about the program and I see many brilliant comments, similar to mine. I certainly hope that ABC reconsiders its decision or I hope that another station picks it up.
