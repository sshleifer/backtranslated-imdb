['In New York, Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an executive junkie in a real estate office who has embezzled a lot for his addiction and his expensive way of life with his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei). When an audit is scheduled in your department, you despair for money. His little brother Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke) is a complete loser who owes his daughter three months of support, and he has a love affair with Gina every Thursday afternoon. Andy traces a robbery of his parents&#39; jewelry on a Saturday morning without the use of weapons, hoping to find an old employee working and without financial damages to his parents, since the insurance company would reimburse the loss. On Monday morning, we would collect the necessary money you need to cover your embezzlement. Invite Hank to participate, as he is well known in the shopping center where the jewelry is located and could be recognized. However, Hank yellows and invites the thief Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. O&#39;Byrne) to steal the store, but things go wrong when his mother Nanette (Rosemary Harris) comes to work as a substitute for the employee and Bobby brings a concealed weapon . . Nanette reacts and kills Bobby, but also receives a lethal shot. After Nanette&#39;s death, his father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney) decides to investigate the theft with tragic consequences. <br /><br /> &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#39;re Dead&quot; is a comedy of errors that reveals a good story. Originality and difference are found in the script, with a non-linear narrative to the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Sidney Lumet, eighty-three years old, has another great job and the longevity of this director is impressive. Philip Seymour Hoffman is amazing in the role of a dysfunctional man with a traumatic relationship with his father who feels that the world is falling apart mainly due to his insecure and clumsy brother. Marisa Tomei is still impressively beautiful and sexy, showing a magnificent body. The violent conclusion shows that the world is certainly a bad place. My vote is seven. <br /><br /> Title (Brazil): &quot;Before the devil Saiba Que VocÃª Est Morto&quot; (&quot;Before the devil knows that you have died&quot;)']
