/ The first episode I saw of Lost made me think, I thought, what is this? Some people crashed and were chased by a giant monster. But it's not like that, it's much more than that, because it's not a monster at all and all the episodes you see of Lost, well, it's getting better every time. a desert island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between people who crossed paths before crashing. That is the true secret. <br /> <br /> The rules of this series and I can not wait to know what is really happening there, I hope that the last 2 episodes in theaters do not go on air, this series deserves a 9 out of 10
