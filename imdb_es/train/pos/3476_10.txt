Let's cut to the chase: if you're a baby boomer, you inevitably spent some time wondering about the fact that, in 1976, McCartney had the nerve to visit the hermit's life in the city of John and spend the day with him. You also asked yourself how things went. I heard exactly the same reports that the writer of this film heard, from the perspective of John and Paul, and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting in almost the same way as this film. But none of my imaginations could have bought tears in my eyes as this incredible work and performance does. I found it incredibly realistic, perfectly plausible and 100% saccharin free. Now, can anyone explain why I did not hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the CBC last night? I mean, he's already three years old, for God's sake! And yes, if you're a Beatles fan, this is a performance you must see! Even the subtle paraphrase of the Beatles melodies in the background is inspired.
