The radio did not happen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when I grew up in the England of the 1930s, so the Children's Hour was a pleasure for me when we had batteries and a spare battery for power. Therefore, the few programs I heard caused a big impression on my young mind, and the 3 that I remember are still "Toytown", one about all the animals in the zoo, and --- Gray Owl, talking about the animals that He knew, that he called his "brothers". I recently learned that Gray Owl was not a true "Indian", but the tribute paid by Chief Sioux makes a lot of sense to me: "A man becomes what he dreams". I wish we could all dream like a changing and beneficial world like Archie Gray Owl Belaney. I wish a new Gray Owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment.
