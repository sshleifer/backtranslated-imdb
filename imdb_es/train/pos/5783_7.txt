I've read Kerching's reviews on IMDb, and, frankly, I have not seen a positive review, until now. Actually I like Kerching. Kerching is about a teenager named Taj Lewis, to win Â£ 1,000,000 for his mother, he creates a website called rudeboy. The website offers many interesting things, even if only Taj and his two friends: Danny and Seymour can prevent Taj from exposing himself. I find this show quite fun and I enjoy watching it. The performance is O.K., but it can definitely be better, the characters are fun, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupidity is what makes it fun. and Taj's other friend, Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of the coffee called "The Chill". We never see it, we just listen to it. Taj's younger brother, Omar, and his older sister, Missy, are also funny. And Missy's best friend, Kareesha. So many times the Taj's has almost been exposed, almost. Besides the comedy, the drama in Kerching, like the love life and the loss of loved ones, makes this program excellent.
