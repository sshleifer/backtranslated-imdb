White man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First nations + nature + animals = GOOD. Simple formula In fact, in the past days the same type of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; Now it is used to attack it. However, having said that, I believe that the film manages to overcome the trite politicization because it plays with the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to all. You may not agree with the film's blatant revisionism of how the West was won, and how it got lost. But anyone can have a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the western plains. (The film also avoids the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation, especially the opening shot, is amazing.
