I really liked the first 2 seasons. because many good characters disappeared later. As most shows are a little slow at first, then they improve in later seasons, but this is the absolute setback. Jenny of the 1st season and Valarie of the 2nd season were Sabrina's friends, I really did not care about the others, Jenny and Valarie were her best friends. I think that for some reason, the producers wanted us not to like their college friends for some reason, they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite episode of season 1 is the cat showdown and my favorite episode of season 2 is trash, that's the funniest episode. I also thought it was funny how Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and she never seemed to have a real boyfriend, but she always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wished they could have done better. I also liked how the first 2 seasons, during the opening credits, Sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume, like in the pilot episode where she wears the witch costume, I liked the way she said "this is not me "and then what I think, she kept trying to change to something else, but this is a really cool show. it's a bit like Andy Griff's show in a way because it was good at first, but once it changed color and it went away, it was kinder. but I still like to see it, but the only reason I see the last seasons is sabrina. What I wanted to say about the opening sequence is: the initial titles of seasons 1-3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits, while the names of the cast members appear quickly at the bottom from the screen. In the end, Sabrina would say a kind of word game related to the outfit she is wearing and then disappear. The opening sequence of the fourth season includes the characters in bubbles. Opening credits for seasons 5-7 include Sabrina at various locations in Boston
