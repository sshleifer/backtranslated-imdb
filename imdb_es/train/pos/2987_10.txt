This is the crying that the beaches never were. As much as I wanted to love Beaches, he always seemed too hurried to "feel it" (although his soundtrack is one of my favorite albums). Stella, on the other hand, moves at a slower pace (and, sometimes, too slow) and although she is somewhat manipulative in her tear-inducing story about a sacrificed mother, it works because Bette and the rest of the cast become great performances . 10/10
