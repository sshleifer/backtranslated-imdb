"The Good Earth" by Sidney Franklin has reached a classic status thanks to a timeless story and an excellent performance, especially of Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for his performance as O-Lan. Rainers performance is so complete that it is almost unrecognizable. Having very little dialogue throughout the film (and it's long), Rainer relies on facial and body language. She looks and acts Chinese to the point that anyone who is not familiar with her work could confuse her as such. <br /> <br /> The film is still relevant today because it explores the story of Rags to Riches and the universal themes that accompany it. . When Lung and his wife O-Lan finally achieve financial success after years of hunger and poverty, they find a life full of possessions but devoid of meaning. It is only when they return to earth after fighting a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are incredible and beautiful to see) that they find their fulfillment again. A common formula told with the unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the film a classic. Money is worth nothing without friends and family, a point that the film takes home perfectly in its last 10 minutes with an emotionally satisfying conclusion.
