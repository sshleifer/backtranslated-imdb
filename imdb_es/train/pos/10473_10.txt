I was in a bad mood when I saw this movie for the first time. For some reason, he clicked on all my levels, tensions in a family, loneliness and lack of someone to share your life with. It did not hurt that the person with whom he shared his life was a beautiful girl like Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the sound track of this movie (very hard to get). I loved it and I hope that someday it will come out in DV
