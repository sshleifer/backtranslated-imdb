['This movie was one of the best Disney movies I&#39;ve ever seen. Ideal for the whole family to see. The ideas may be a bit exaggerated, but it is a comedy to feel good and the acting is excellent. I love the child, jp and winner of an award from the academy. Adrien Brody&#39;s part may have been very brief, but memorable. highly recommended']
