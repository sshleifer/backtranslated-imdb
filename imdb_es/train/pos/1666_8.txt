This is a film about seventeenth-century Italian artists and one artist in particular, Artemis woman, an unknown profession for women at that time, and she dared to paint the male nude detailing her unique musculature. <br /> <br /> The camera work is mainly indoors, that's where the artists worked mainly. There are some great shots. The close-ups in the light of the candles suggest the beautiful work of classical painters and it is fascinating to observe the painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding that brush details of religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, makeup) are very authentic because the Italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia is urged by her father to study with the great Florentine artist, Tassi, who has become an expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new), but the carefree Artemisia is introduced to more What new techniques in painting. After posing for her, Tassi rapes her violently. His father is outraged. Follow the judicial procedures. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes like women running through a field with the wind waving their voluminous clothes add wonderful effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says that she paints to please herself; his father paints to please others. As for this movie, I'll like it more, I think.
