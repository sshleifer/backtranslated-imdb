"The Luzhin Defense" is, in the foreground, a story of an idiosyncratic ajedrecida of chess (Turturro) that is consumed in the game and, in the background, through flashbacks, his life in childhood and the forces that created the man that he has become. Factor in good and evil in the ways of his love interest (Watson) and the former "mentor" (Wilson) respectively, and has a plaintive drama with touching and delicately comical moments mixed with the rich scenic beauty of Lake Como in Italy and the intensity of the high chess game. An excellent film for those in period dramas, the metaphor of the author's euphemistic chess game for orgasmic pleasure is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film.
