Filmed on an impossible schedule and without a budget, the film was much better than you would expect, certainly much more faithful to Peter O'Donnell's books and comics than the previous two films. You can read the strip currently in the reprints of Titan Books or in Comics Revue monthly. It is one of the best adventure comic strips of all time. The film is not excellent, but unlike most low-budget films, it makes the most of what it has, and maintains its interest. In the DVD extras, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, who is obviously drugged, is a gas. Some people have criticized Tarentino for associating his name with the film, but without him it would never have been done. He is a fan of Modesty Blaise, and he chose a good writer and director. All things considered, worth 8 stars.
