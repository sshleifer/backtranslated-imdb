Pity that a couple of comments before me do not know the facts of this case. It's based on real events, a highly publicized murder and disappearance case that takes place in the Wilmington region, DE / Philadelphia PA from '96 to 2000. I must admit I was very skeptical about how Hollywood would dramatize the story and the Real Events and Actually, I was quite impressed by how close they were to what was constantly reported on the local news and the Philadelphia Inquirer news throughout the period. Of course, I immediately pointed out that the actress (who I really like in Cold Case) who played Fahey was nothing like her (Anne Marie was actually prettier). However, I must admit that Mark Harmon really defined the personality type that was revealed as Capano and the behavior that Capano exhibited throughout this period. The details of the case were correct ... without deviations from the dramatic effect ... even the carpet, the gun, the furniture and the refrigerator. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I have met Tom Carper many times in various functions (a good man, despite being a politician) and I am very happy that he has achieved the necessary threads in the federal sphere to solve this atrocious crime. The guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars.
