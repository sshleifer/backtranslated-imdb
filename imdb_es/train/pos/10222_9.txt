The unlikely duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte come together to give us some interesting performances and themes at The Angel Levine. It's an interesting twist on the themes of It's A Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and the two belong to a special class of poor Jewish elders in New York. Mostel used to be a tailor and was proud of his craft, but his back and his arthritis have prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. It has been reduced to request welfare. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he asks God for help. <br /> <br /> Now, if I had gotten someone like Henry Travers, things would have worked differently, but even Stewart had a hard time accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing in his favor, he had more than 100 years out of this death spiral and all his ties to earthly things had disappeared. God sent Mostel something very different, the recently deceased Harry Belafonte, who should have been given basic training to the angels before being assigned a task. <br /> <br /> Belafonte has not accepted that he has passed from life, he still has many problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know he has died, hit by a car right at the beginning of the movie. You put your problems and those of Mostel and you have a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel can not believe in a black Jew named Levine. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell performance for Polish / Jewish actress Ida Kaminsky, who earned a Best Actress nomination at The Shop on Main Street a few years ago. The other prominent role here is that of the Irish actor Milo O'Shea playing a good Jewish doctor. Remembering the accent of O'Shea from The Verdict, I was very surprised to see him and hear how the doctor's part is taken. <br /> <br /> Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. It is brought to you by a stellar cast and, of course, created by acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure you catch it when it is issued.
