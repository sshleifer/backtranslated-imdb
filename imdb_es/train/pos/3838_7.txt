['THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). <br /><br /> A film based on a novel by Gerard Reve, which works best as a thriller. That&#39;s quite surprising, considering that Reve needs about a hundred pages for a small twist of the plot and tension is the last thing in my mind when reading your work. <br /><br /> &quot;The fourth man&quot; is very loaded with symbolism. In general, Paul Verhoeven is extremely worried about showing something to mostly hostile critics and I am never sure what exactly he is trying to prove. In general, it underestimates its audience and tells its story in such a subtle way, quickly deviates from the original idea or plot, and almost seems to forget what should be seen on the screen and what should be omitted. In &quot;The Fourth Man&quot; is not as explicit in the detail of the plot as it is with sex and nudity (of which there is much), but, as in most of his films, it seems that the audience would not understand and he gets home. the story with open symbolism mixed with some supposedly stunning graphic nudity and sex scenes. There is hardly a scene without frontal sex or nudity, most of them so maddeningly gratuitous and, in your face, undermines a good story. <br /><br /> However, when you can deal with Verhoeven&#39;s fairly obvious satirical approach, it&#39;s sometimes an entertaining thriller with some intriguing plot twists and good performances in general, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√© in particular. <br /><br /> Dark camera --- 7/10']
