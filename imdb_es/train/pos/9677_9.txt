This film on the surface seems to be a series of children's films that parents can unfortunately see with their mostly entertaining young children. The film seems and is aimed primarily at children, but it does not stop at this level. I saw this movie for the first time as a child and it seemed fun, entertaining and comforting, and I did not see it again for several years. I saw him again recently at the age of 18 and I found him almost as fun as encouraging and entertaining. This movie is highly undervalued and contains many real life messages. This film is an inspiring search story that is made for children, but epic in itself. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
