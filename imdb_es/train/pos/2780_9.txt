Great movie - I loved it. Great edition and use of the soundtrack. It captures the true feeling of Indian life, however, we can all relate. A well-chosen cast with some great characters. The film develops all the characters so that you really care for everyone and feel that you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is excellent and the direction really works, since everyone becomes real and natural. You can not stop encouraging Jess in this movie! The performance was really good, even the twisted gait and body posture of both women leaders is very convincing as someone who played a lot of football.
