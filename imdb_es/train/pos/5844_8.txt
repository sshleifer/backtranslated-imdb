In 1948 this was my favorite movie of all time. The costumes of Betty Grable were so dazzling that I wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as the handsome Hungarian officer. As silly and fluffy as this film may seem at the beginning, when I was eight years old, I thought I was saying something important about the relationships between men and women. I saw him again the other day; I was surprised to discover that I still did.
