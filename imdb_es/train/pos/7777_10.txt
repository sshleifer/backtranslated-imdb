['Rich and alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with secretary Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is so happy that he stops drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks&#39; best friend, Rock Hudson. And Stacks&#39; nymphomaniac sister, Dorothy Malone, covets Rock. Add some complications and the movie gets out of control (in a good way). <br /><br /> Very bright film in beautiful Technicolor, with fashions and amazing furniture (see Bacall hotel room at the beginning). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful and tight clothes. Basically it is a telenovela with production values of grade A. The story itself is very funny and some of the dialogues at the beginning are very funny. The performance of Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not so good, but seeing them so young and glamorous is great ... especially Stack ... when he smiled, my knees weakened. Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic: she deservedly won the Best Supporting Actress for her role. She is sexy, violent, vicious and nice ... all convincing. <br /><br /> Fun, bright garbage. Do not miss it!']
