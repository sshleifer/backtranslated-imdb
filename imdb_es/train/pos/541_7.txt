Like a sequel, this is not a bad movie. In fact, I liked it better than the first one. I found it more entertaining. It seemed that it was filmed in the documentary style. At first this bothered me, since I thought it seemed too low. budget. but it grew in me, and it made the movie look more authentic. This movie has more dry lines than the original, which is good, in my opinion. I think sometimes they went a little over with some of the scenes and the characters. It almost becomes a parody of itself, which may be the point. This movie at least has some suspense, which the first did not have, in my opinion. It has something of the same genius. original music, which is great. the performance again was pretty decent for the most part, although as I said, some of that seemed exaggerated. I also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are some minutes that seem very slow and just do not seem to flow, like the rest of the movie. However, in general, I thought it was a nice sequel. The rating of "Return to the cottage by the lake" is 7/10 *
