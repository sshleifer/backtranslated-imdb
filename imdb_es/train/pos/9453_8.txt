['Deliverance is the fascinating, disturbing and, sometimes, even disturbing tale of James Dickey, turned into a brilliant film by John Boorman. It&#39;s about four businessmen, driven by virility and macho behavior, who spend a weekend canoeing in the mountains. Up there, they face each darker side of man and each of the worst forms of human misery ... poverty, buggy and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel the river in search of adventure and excitement, but their journey will soon become an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain land, completely separated from all forms of civilization. All these elements make Deliverance one of the heaviest movies I&#39;ve seen in my life. Almost everything that happens to these men, you pray that you will never find yourself in a similar situation. Pure-speaking cinema, Deliverance is also a very important film. The best of John Boorman (followed closely by Zardoz and Excalibur) was, and still is, a very influential film and contains several memorable scenes that have already been featured in many other films. Just think about the fantastic musical score of &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual rape scene of &quot;squeal like a pig&quot;. All actors offer (haha) performances of perfect performance. Especially Jon Voight. You have to see the movie!']
