['Maléfique is a very interesting movie. It is a profane alloy of triumphs and failures. The central concept is excellent: three prisoners with strange personalities join a room (with which the audience is identified) and try to escape from their cell with a magic book they find inside the walls of the cell. <br /><br /> The atmosphere is well woven, it reminds me of the reading of the stay in prison of Edmond Dantes in the Château d&#39;If (before becoming the Count of Monte Cristo). The director establishes the feeling that the characters are linked to the cell, particularly the character with whom we are destined to identify ourselves (Carrère, a white collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but indirectly suggests that it could be a fraud). On one occasion, Carrère retires when he leaves the cell to exercise and closes the door; We never left the cell, the claustrophobia is intact. There are also no jail shots outside the cell, and the view through the bars is a wistful sunset over a generic prison wall. So, although the film seems to be very modern, it has a very old sense of imprisonment. <br /><br /> The characters are intriguing. We have Marcus, a violent preoperative transsexual who plays an abusive mother of Pâquerette (in French for Daisy) a very retarded young man. Patquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful, and unfortunately this included his little sister, hence his current situation (I like this comment on internalization, very primitive). Lasalle is a retired old man, possessed, for brutally murdering his wife. <br /><br /> The central message of the film is that your desires will annihilate you, and that entails a ritual. I think that&#39;s what bothers me the most when I see that people destroy themselves in a ritual way. It has a real life ring. The fairly simple soundtrack supports this well, each step deeper into the fast sand is accompanied by the muffled sound of a gong. In fact, now I listen to the gong every time I do something self-destructive. <br /><br /> I think one of the problems with the plot is that the extremes of the characters do not really reinforce the message in a consistent way, particularly with Carrère, also the concept of the book seems to be altered throughout the film, not in terms of a successive revelation . I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more for their design than for their execution, such as the famous &quot;eye of the vagina&quot; and Lasalle&#39;s sodomy, for me, totally hollow images. <br /><br /> At the end of the film, it seems that the director is in a hurry to get it over with, and some things do not seem logical, for example, they have led us to believe crudely different things about Carrère&#39;s daughter. However, this does not change the fact that what we have here is that rare bird, a &quot;pure&quot; horror movie. There are no comic slags or genre scenes, like Cube (1997 / Natali), the obvious movie to compare, it&#39;s a total immersion experience, where you feel like you&#39;re in the cell with the characters. This last comment I make is a &quot;pure&quot; experience that I think is something that others have also mentioned, so it&#39;s a pretty unanimous point. <br /><br /> On a personal note, my favorite part of the film is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian. He describes very vividly a scene in which he will work one day and sits in his usual place in the center of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him. The books seem to sing to him that he will never contain his knowledge. This leads Lasalle to go crazy. That is really the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge. It is something that I have felt. <br /><br /> A final comment is that two of the comments fairly well received on the board have confused the names of the characters. To convince yourself that Lasalle is the oldest librarian character, simply click on the Philippe Laudenbach page and you will see that he was born in 1936.']
