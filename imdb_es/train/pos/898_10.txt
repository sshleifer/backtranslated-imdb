One would have to be very tired not to be dragged into this movie jewel (and I've also seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies). The actors, the beautiful scenes, the places and the surroundings, the deep emotions represented, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite), everything was just lovely. The human element (imperfect) also intertwined to create some drama and direct the plot, in addition to allowing a sincere resolution. Alok Nath is such a great actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he plays, that he almost steals the show from the young stars. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves true romances, those that go beyond superficial beauty to real love, like one of the best movies, Hindi or not!
