Well, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone says here that this is the worst! But is not!!! Have not you seen Freddy's revenge? WTF! That was the worst of all! Now this movie is pretty decent and adheres to Freddy's story and it's great that he had a daughter, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> And then I discovered that I was in 3-D !! I was so excited, I remember when I saw it in the DVD box, I instantly jumped into 3D sequences. Much was in 3-D, though like the hand of Lisa Zanes, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean holding a knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat, Doc's hand, Freddy's head exploiting <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie because it was 3-D, but I would like the whole movie to be in 3-D, not just the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's 15 minutes NOT TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
