This is one of the so-called 'feel good' movies, however, somehow it saddened me. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents did not let me study at the sports academy, as well as the fact that at age 12 I decided to quit football. <br /> <br /> And football is the red line In this movie. Along with the struggle that young people have with the expectations that parents have. An English-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand, the English family with a daughter who dresses like a child and plays football ... a combination that worries her mother! This film also aligns the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams and living your only life (where we heard that before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (a beautiful woman!) Interprets Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in children, new clothes, makeup and the typical 17-year-old girl. In contradiction with her sister Pinky, complete the opposite of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> It is a real obligation to see how a beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of her parents and finds her luck eventually. With excellent music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as songs of Indian hits. <br /> <br /> Nice to see, but if you, like me, ever played football, and never got to the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.
