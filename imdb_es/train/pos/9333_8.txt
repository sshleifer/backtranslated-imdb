Having lived in Ontario all my life, in the same city where Marlene Moore grew up, I have heard stories of her from my parents, grandparents and relatives. Then, when I found out they would be filming a movie about her, and that the beginning would roll on my street, and her house was very close to mine, I was thrilled. <br /> <br /> If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby, which is about Marlene Moore, has a very different image of her as a person, she was considered incredibly beautiful by the people who really had the opportunity to meet her, with the exception of of her own family, which often abused her. Child, except for one of his brothers. Also, if you live in my area and you are smart enough to listen to those around you and who knew her from school, you would discover that she was truly hurt before she set foot in an institution, she was always on the defensive and what would seem as the lack of will to learn in a school environment was actually a shame for the fact that she could not do it. <br /> <br /> Marlene did not deserve the life she had been given, with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive. It was the government and the people around him who helped the most in his death by not trying to understand his needs and why he did what he did. I still get angry for being imprisoned for the personal defense of a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said: "They did not know what to do with her, that's why they locked her up and that killed her." I believe in that with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in peace, Marlene, you deserve it a lot.
