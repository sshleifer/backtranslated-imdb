Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen him at least a hundred times and I can not get through without crying. I challenge anyone to see the meeting of Celie and Nettie, or Shug and her father, and I do not feel your eyes fogging. Whoopie Goldberg should have one and a prize for her incredible performance. And for the person who said you can not love the movie if you loved the book, bad! I am a testimony of that.
