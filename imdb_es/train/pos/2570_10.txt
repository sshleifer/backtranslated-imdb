Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've seen and I love it so much that I've memorized most of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee takes force) and even with the script in me I still like it see it by Jerry Lee, that German shepherd is hysterical and really puts himself to the test to see who is smarter. The line of the label is true too. Not to mention that the acting is great, although Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (check the filmography in CSI if you do not know what I mean). It is a pity that this film only contained the only problem that Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work with; It would have been great to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had up their sleeve.
