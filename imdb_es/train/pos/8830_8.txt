This is a recording of a masterpiece in 35mm B / W film. The movie makes you see a strange way to start the day at 7:35 a.m. in a bar and the amount of things that can happen there in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> The short surprisingly puts you in a complex story using very few elements, and step by step it makes you realize that something is not totally right. Express yourself a lot, make your adrenaline go with subtle details, and it's incredibly understandable to everyone, not just the film critics. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: short European, black and white and low budget Do not let that scare you. It's really worth it to be seen by everyone, not just the experts in the genre. <br /> <br /> It's not much more than telling, since the movie only lasts 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to spoil it. But I only saw it online and I could not understand why nobody took a few minutes to post a comment about it. <br /> <br /> It's really worth seeing. 10/10.
