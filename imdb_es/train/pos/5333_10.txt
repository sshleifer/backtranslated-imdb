How this has not turned into a cult movie, I do not know. I think that sadly it has been overlooked as a really ingenious comedy! <br /> <br /> "Runaway Car" tries to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller, but taking the quality of the performance (my God, it's bad), The Story, the practical aspects of the demonic possession of the automobile and The scene of evacuation of the baby in sight, there is nothing you can do but laugh. And laugh you will. Films are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do so can be an indication of the value of a movie. This movie is the pinnacle in entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. In a moment I was breathless and almost choked, it is really funny in some points. When the baby was taken from the sunroof in a helicopter with a pilot robot that managed to maintain a constant speed identical to that of the car and a perfectly flat flight plain which meant that the hook did not break the roof of the vehicle into pieces. , I laughed hysterically But when the baby began to swing in the air, almost hit a bridge and almost got tangled in a tree, tears ran down my face. <br /> <br /> It also occurred to me that the black policeman was the guy who played Jesus in Madonna's video "Like A Prayer." He seems to get everywhere.
