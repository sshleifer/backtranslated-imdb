SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon, with an impeccable idea, and almost all the shorts are a jewel. While I must say that this is definitely a shorter short compared to other Tom and Jerry classics, there is no way to hate this caricature. Sure, it's understandable to say that this is one of the worst episodes of Tom and Jerry, and I can say I agree, but the fact is that all the episodes of Tom and Jerry are great, but some are just better than others. Well, this would fit into "others". <br /> <br /> Here is Fraidy Cat's plot. Tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast, and he's easily scared. Jerry watches how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates terrifying dilemmas for Tom, and Tom is scared of his wit and his life. Jerry then places a sheet over a vacuum and controls it, so it seems that the vacuum is a ghost. Tom discovers that Jerry did all this and chases him. Tom then accidentally bites the maid of the house. However, in the end, Jerry ends up feeling scared after seeing his reflection in a cup of flour. <br /> <br /> In general, this is far from being the best of Tom and Jerry, but it is still a problem. Fun and entertaining piece of time. It makes me wish there were more cartoons like this one. The slapstick and the gags in this that make famous Tom and Jerry are as good as ever in this short film, but I felt that something was missing in this. He felt slower than most of Tom and Jerry's shorts. Anyway, this is a good short that does not live up to other Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> 7/10
