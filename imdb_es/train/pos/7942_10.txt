Fans of Giallo, look for this rare movie. It is well written and full of all kinds of the habitual low lives that populate these movies. I do not want to reveal anything, so I will not say anything about the plot. The whole movie creates a very strange atmosphere, and you do not know what to expect or who to suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen to get this film in English is from European Trash Cinema, for $ 15.
