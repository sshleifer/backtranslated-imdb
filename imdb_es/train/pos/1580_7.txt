This is not another sharp look at the Holocaust, but an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in Berlin and some of the people involved. This film begins today in the city of New York, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) is mourning the death of her husband and members of his family have gathered at his side. Hannah (Maria Schrader), the daughter of Ruth, slowly learns that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), so she travels to Germany and locates the 90-year-old girl who tells her events in Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943, where the Gestapo would stop all Jewish wives in a building in the Rosenstrasse, although she is supposed to have immunity for being married to Aryans and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and scream for her release. Ruth (Svea Lohde), eight years old, expects her mother to leave and has nowhere to go, but meets Lena (Katja Riemann), 33, who receives her. Lena's husband, Fabian (Martin Feifel), is also inside and, finally, tries. to socialize with Nazi officials to do something. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Margarethe von Trotta, who made her first feature film in almost 10 years after working on television and, although this is not one. of her most provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in Europe. This is not one of those Nazi films where we see horrible acts of inhumanity for the Jews, although we see that severe treatment is being issued, but instead it is about recounting a small event that meant life and the death of the people involved. This film does not attempt to surprise anyone or open the door to debates about the circumstances, but what it simply wants to do is shed light on a small but true occurrence of life that occurred during a historical period. Part of the strength of the film comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine especially from Riemann and young Lohde, and it's always good to see Schrader (Aimee and Jaguar) in a pivotal role. This is not a great movie or something that will change your perspective on World War II, but considering that the innocent lives were executed due to the events that took place, I think that only the reason is important enough to retell this real story .
