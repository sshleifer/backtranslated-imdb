This movie probably had a budget of $ 750, and still managed to beat the Titanic. I rented it the day I crashed my mom's car, and it was the only thing that encouraged me beyond belief! It has to be tied with 'The Assult of the Killer Bimbos'. The things you should look for are: 1. The hard drive in the scene of a Chinese girl 2. The white blonde in the sassoon shirt that never changes 3. The scream of Flinstone when going out to the street 4. The shocking set that uses the redhead just before she gets killed (do not worry, I'm not ruining any surprise, because it's so predictable) 5. The guy who finds it necessary to howl. 6. The mental patient who performs a convincing job of being crazy when he takes the eyes of a man. 7. The persecution of an hour at the end involves the teacher and the priest. 8. The womman writing graffiti on the bathroom wall. 9. Last but not least, the wonderful special effects, especially the stab in the teat that made a ... heaven help me ... pop. <br /> <br /> enjoy! <br /> <br />
