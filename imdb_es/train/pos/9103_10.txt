In life, we first organize stones (Stones in Spanish) as a career, family, friendship and love. In this way, we will find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small needs. If you act in reverse, you will not have enough space for larger stones. The five protagonists of this film are women who have not been able to organize the big "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish film director, defines his first feature film Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel and conflictive story of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen (Vicky Peña, 1954 -). Everyone is trying to eliminate stones that appear insistently in their path or, worse, that are in their shoes. There are five Cinderellas in search of the Prince Charming and a new opportunity in life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita (Mónica Cervera) who also stars "20 Centimeters", "Busco", "Crime Ferpecto", "Between Living and Sonar", "Fungi" and "Octavia".
