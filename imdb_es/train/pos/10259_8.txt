Many people unfairly participate in this series, but several of Guinea Pig's videos are quite entertaining. The devil's experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects, not only the infamous scene of the eyeball, but also a very realistic skin cut on the foot and a broken hand with a hammer are very realistic, especially for classic video and of low budget. <br /> <br /> Let me start at the beginning now for those who do not know: this movie is an "extreme" torture / snuff movie that appeared in Japan in the mid-80s. The plot in its current state It's simple: some young people arrest a young woman and force her to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is. This entails brutal violence, all effectively realistic effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as a painful-looking hot oil application on the arm of the captive girl and the placement of worms in the posterior scaly wound. <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences are at the beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slapping session in which three men take turns hitting the girl while the head falls and a second sequence in which The three men kick the girl. and pushing it to the ground. These two scenes are obviously organized and detract from the realism of the rest of the procedures. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the victim of the "experiment" is quite convincing to be in pain and takes a good amount of Abuse and rude things on camera. Their reactions, like the headphones that are tied to the head and loud noises that are heard for hours and hours, are chilling. Some of the other abuses he takes are tied to a tree net during the only occasions when he is given a break. There is also a disturbing scene in which the captors laugh through their guts and a disgustingly disgusting scene where they spin her in an office chair and force her to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until she vomits. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series. I hope I helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a chance. 8.5 / 10 for the devil experiment.
