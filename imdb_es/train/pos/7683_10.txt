I loved the good times with the rest of you. I love reading the INTELLIGENT and INTELLIGENT comments. The writers in THIS program were fantastic and the Actors went beyond TALENTED. To answer Strawberry22 (the clearer comment to the other top and positive comment) ... What happened was that James died in an accident (I think I remember it was a truck accident or a car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it was first broadcast and it was a very small thing ... it was very sad for me ...). <br /> <br /> Florida and the children really come out of the projects and still become neighbors with Willona (Wilnona) and that's how the last show ended. <br /> <br /> ALL the children achieved their dreams and found opportunities in each one of them. It was a wonderful ending and I cried because I was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that I really believed in their destiny. I hope that this kind of ending will be true for many. <br /> <br /> They followed a great show and many other great shows, including Benson and The Jeffersons. This was an incredible period for African-American television and the best writers were incredible at that time. TV LAND is amazing for the memories and I LOVE because I can not STOP the garbage that we are seeing today. SOMEONE ... recover the 70s and 80s quickly ... your smart spectators are a dying race and we need better material. <br /> <br /> Love, a comedian of television comedies of TV LAND from the 70s and 80s. (as they sing in "ALL in the Family" ... those were the days ......
