The lively dark knight returns in this adventure film that rivals Mask of Phantasm in its freshness. There is a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> There is a new crime fighter on the streets of Gotham. She dresses like a bat, but she is not an older Batgirl. And Batman is denying any affiliation with her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to deal with romances and the usual detective work. But the penguin, Bain and the local mafia make things a little more complicated. <br /> <br /> I did not have much hope for this 'a', as I was very disappointed, but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin is not '' I appeared a lot here!) but was delighted with the imaginative pieces and exciting, the intelligent plot and a cheeky sense of humor. This is definitely a movie that no Batman fan should be without. Keep your ears open for a really catchy song called 'Betcha Neva', which stands out prominently. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that the DVD is not so good. Do not get me wrong, there are some great features (the short 'Chase Me' is amazing) and a very good soundtrack of Dolby 5.1, but ... the film is presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and filmed at 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1 and compared to the widescreen clips that are shown in the functions. The image is cut on both sides. I find it extremely annoying considering that Mask of Phantasm was presented on anamorphic widescreen. Warner has had to literally re-publish dozens of DVD movies because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available in some titles. The reason why they chose to make the same mistake here again beats me. <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR reduces the overall score to 4/5. It's a shame because the widescreen had completed a large DVD package.
