The first time I saw this movie on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film paints an accurate picture of the south and racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, a former plantation owner who uses convicts for work. Soll is what the movement does, his funny ramblings give us an idea of ​​what the South was like back then. I suppose if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. However, his attitudes towards a young child who comes to work for him and for convicts are complex. While he has racist views, he has grown up to trust some of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the film, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler, both with great performances, just like Hass. <br /> <br /> This movie should have acquired more notoriety. However, it's on DVD and it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
