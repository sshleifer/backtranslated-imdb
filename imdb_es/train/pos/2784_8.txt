Nagra comes from a conservative Indian family that is not exactly interested in girls who play competitive soccer. But our attractive young star CAN play some serious football. Rhys-Meyers trains Nagra and encourages her to act, while Knightley is a teammate and support friend. When the sister's wedding is scheduled for the same day as the last soccer match, what can a girl do? Similar in its own unique form of BFGW, as Nagra tries to push the envelope of traditional family forms. Here is dad (well played by Kher) who can see both sides of the problem. He linked up a whole point for a non-sexual last-minute crisis, if they had needed more information, they could have gone elsewhere. Good final finish for the whole deal.
