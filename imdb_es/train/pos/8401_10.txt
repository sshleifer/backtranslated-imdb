The trap of love is an independent film that "you must see". When I sat down to watch the movie, I entered with few expectations, but I left with a blessing. The story is poetic, substantive and creative. The writer takes you further and further in each scene, allowing you to relate to the realistic characters with whom everyone can identify. The film allowed me to reflect on my life and what I consider to be love. The film shows what love really is, action not emotion. I was also impressed by the quality of the film and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the movie two big thumbs up and I recommend it to all ages and all backgrounds.
