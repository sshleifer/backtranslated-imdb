['I like this episode a bit, Ruth Gordon is good, if not a little hammy as she always was. As has been said, the music is very good and has a bad mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /><br /> But there is a big hole in the plot, so wide that you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is established that the light does not work in the vault. Do not you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police had thought to check if the bulb worked? One would think that in a short time they would have unscrewed the bulb and thus they would have found the note. Of course, this is television fiction, and you will always find several holes, but this seems too dazzling. <br /><br /> It really does not cause Columbo to become the hidden genius when the light does not work, but the testimony of the &quot;deathbed&quot; remains unfounded, apparently for days.']
