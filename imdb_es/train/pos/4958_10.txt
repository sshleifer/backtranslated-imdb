Full disclosure: I am a cynic. I like my sad endings and my dry handkerchiefs. I did not cry when they shot Bambi's mother. Will Smith's new movie, Happiness, looks like a desperate plea for an Oscar. Basically I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So, why the hell did I like the "10 items or less?" Maybe it was the double espresso that I took before the show. Or (more likely) maybe it was that even the most movie fanatics could use an occasional shot of sweetness. <br /> <br /> And sweet it is. From the moment "He" meets "Scarlet" (an event far from a "nice meeting" Nora Ephron), the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers who learn to worry about the direction of their lives . (Beautifully helped by Phedon Papamichael's camera work in true film style). <br /> <br /> The main argument about the film is that it is too far away. Is the film very unlikely? I do not know. You tell me. I still have to meet Adrian Brody in the market. (However, not for lack of trying). Do I enjoy considering the adventures that could occur if this transcendental event took place? Darn right I do it. . .which is where most comments of "10 articles or less" fall short. . It does not take into account that even we, the cynics, have fantasies. And, sometimes, it's worth the price of admission to live indirectly, 82 minutes at a time.
