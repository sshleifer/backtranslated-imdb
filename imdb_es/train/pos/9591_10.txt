An excellent documentation. Personally I remember growing up in New York in the early 80's. This movie is for anyone who was not present during that period of time. This shows the only thing that the lower Class of African-American gays felt was exclusively theirs and that the love and the camera you see is real. People are real and, unfortunately, few are still alive while writing this. The balls are still maintained, but not to the extent that they were in the eighties. That time is gone forever. This is a good pre "homo thug" movie. When the queens were really proud of being extroverted. Goodbye to Storyville, this is another last era but largely documented the whole hail movie!
