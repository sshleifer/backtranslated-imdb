Although I've been a Peter Weir fan for a long time, I had not seen any of his Australian films until I saw The Last Wave. And it was a pleasant and unpredictable surprise. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines accused of murdering another aborigine. For David's classmates, it is a clear case of drunkenness and they believe they should plead guilty and serve a fast sentence. But David believes that there is a mystery behind the murder, linked to tribal rituals. As your research progresses, you learn not only about your clients, but also about yourself. <br /> <br /> Revealing more would be ruining one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. I can only say that this movie goes in directions that nobody would expect. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this a fascinating film: Chamberlain's performance, for example; but also the performances of David Gulpilil, who plays a young aborigine who introduces David into the tribal mysteries; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old aborigine who is a spiritual guide. The relationships between these three characters make the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> But there's also the way that Weir suggests the supernatural in the movie. David has dreams that warn him of the future. Australia is suffering from a horrible climate, with storms, hail and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing but pollution. But it is also related to the case that David is defending. How it relates is one of the great revelations of the film. Outside of small events, Weir manages to create an atmosphere of fear and oppression, suggesting future horrors without showing anything. <br /> <br /> Charles Wain's score is fantastic, especially the use of didgeridoo. The photography is also pretty good. Russell Boyd, Weir's veteran PD who won an Oscar in 2004 for Master and Commander, describes a dark and spooky world full of mystery. <br /> <br /> I also find it remarkable that for a film focused on aborigines, do not do it. Do not become an accusation against white culture or a happy celebration of their traditions, such as Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai. This movie is too smart to be so simplistic. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it can upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything that makes sense; but for those who do not care about something strange or ambiguous, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
