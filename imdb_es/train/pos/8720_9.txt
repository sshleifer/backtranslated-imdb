All of you who despaired to see the emptiness and weaknesses of the latest Disney Studios productions, here comes something that should heal your wounds ... Once and for all, the life of A Bug offers the proof that purely images synthetics that lead a good stage offer more interest than the false drawings "handmade, like those of Disney" (see the Lion King, Pocahontas and all the latest productions in which sadly regrets that the magic background and atmosphere of Bambi have gone forever). <br /> <br /> The life of an insect (1001 Pattes for my French cinematic colleagues!) Manages to avoid all the imperfections that make you wake up in the middle of the movie and says "Hey, this thing is generated by computer ! " Without weak parts, a tremendous effort that shows its efficiency in the backgrounds and the overall appearance of the sets, an amazing bird in 3D (close to perfection in its imitation of reality) ... and that's just to mention the aspects technicians <Br /> <br /> The stage, my friends, the real backbone of a movie, has a certain thickness! Interestingly, and obviously thanks to the Lasseter team, there is practically no musical sequence in the life of A bug. Which means that the story is long and rich enough to get rid of these 3 or 4 minutes that some children appreciate, but most dislike them (the same for parents or anime fans, like me). This movie reminded me of a very old movie with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: the 3 Amigos; Basically it had the same background story (an entire Mexican village that lives in fear of a few bad guys, hires armed men (who eventually become actors) to protect them, etc.). Simple, but efficient, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants in the face of the wrath of vicious insects. <br /> <br /> From Microcosm, many movies tell stories of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I think that the life of an insect is the funniest and best directed of all. The process of humanization has been perfectly achieved ... And the whole audience was captivated by the adventures of Flik (also known as Tilt in France). <br /> <br /> Thank you very much for the Lasseter team, especially for the last 30 seconds. .. it is so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs / actors forget their lines or hit the camera ... <br /> <br /> And finally, especially for those of you who They have seen the French version, other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who did a great job of timing in this movie. The life of an insect is really a good piece of entertainment, and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos (a privilege granted to very few movies, and that's not a storage problem). Go see it, that's an order.
