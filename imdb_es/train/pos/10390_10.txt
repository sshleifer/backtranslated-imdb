Along with "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz", this is still one of the best fantasy movies ever made. It is a real shame that it is not as well known as the previous films (maybe because it adheres to a story based on legends instead of contemporary scenarios or science fiction, and that it is British, which means a smaller market for films) , but it's wonderful to know that you deserve that reputation. <br /> <br /> Like all great family movies, one can be a child, an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this movie (I am currently 18 years old), but one should appreciate the classic movies first. I absolutely adore this movie. It has an extraordinary musical score by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic film score) that competes with any score of "Star Wars" by John Williams, a fast but not flashy rhythm, beautiful scenarios, dialogues and use of color (both sets as cinematography won the Oscar) and Oscar-winning special effects (for the moment, and some are still impressive). And, of course, June Duprez's sensuality seems like the princess competes with Catherine Zeta-Jones (she even looks like Jones somehow!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movies of the moment (next to "The adventures of Robin Hood") and really deserves more attention. It is a true enchantment adventure in everything and, together with "Robin Hood", is the movie of my desert island that I can see again and again without bothering me. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (excellent)
