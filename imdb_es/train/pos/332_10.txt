Although I have not seen this miniseries in more than twenty years, I can still remember how the balance between the character, the plot and the story of wonderful adventures was successful. The use of special effects was restricted by making a more poetic narrative rather than literal from the story. The two versions I've seen were dubbed (English and French) but the actors seem to speak their own language, not just Italian, so there's a synchronization problem. It does not spoil storytelling. Among the cast, Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most recognizable for the Americans. Recommended for all returning Odysseus fans.
