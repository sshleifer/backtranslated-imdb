While the soundtrack is a little outdated, this story is more relevant than ever in the US. UU Not only blue collar jobs, but all jobs are outsourced by US corporations, while the benefits of government and Americans suffer. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss is Emory, a steel worker who works in the same job as his father for 35 years. His wife is well represented by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic and tries to support the family with two children when Emory loses his job. The factory is closed under the pretext of mismanagement, but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay a steel worker in a month (subcontracting) what they would have to pay Strauss / Emory in a day. It does not matter that these men are all good loyal workers who have values ​​and try the best for their family. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (as Strauss' brother) and some other co-workers are also affected. It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. Emory hopes that his local union can reopen the mill, as they promise to do so. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother, Lee already sees the writing on the wall. There are no jobs left in the rust belt (Ohio) and they must move on. However, where can the US move? UU.? Where will it be best for a blue collar steel worker? <br /> <br /> There is a triumphant scene at the end where Emory and his team fill the loading dock with steel products. The guard allows them to do this as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and has empathy. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie about difficult times here in the United States. Something that few want to face until they are personally affected. 8/10.
