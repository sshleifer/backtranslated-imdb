['This is an excellent and heartbreaking film. It is by far the best I have seen describing the current reality in Latin America ... kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers and a heartless chaos towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton gives the most poignant performance of his career, in my opinion. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, he believed every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are great as always. Walken illuminates the screen for me like no other actor. I would have loved to see more of the two. The authentic places are remarkable. The camera work is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the cast, which makes it more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinema. I recommend this movie.']
