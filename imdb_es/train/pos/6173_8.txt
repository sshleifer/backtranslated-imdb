A great movie. The performance, from the doctor to the sidewalk artist and the main prostitute, with very few exceptions, was wonderful; I thought that soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of the least known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who could be accused of overreaching, presented a fairly credible and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing was the camera work, and the way he captured the energy of the streets of Bombay, the tranquility of gustad by saying his prayers and his life inside the tiny apartments. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the wall that becomes a sanctuary and then breaks down, and the artists take it seriously. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good movies about Indian themes.
