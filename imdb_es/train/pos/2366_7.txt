This movie (with the alternative title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And it was a great introduction. Although he had never heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent fighter. The action scenes in this movie are great! There are many of them too, by the way. The recruits fight in the Peace Barracks is especially good. There's something about a single man hitting a lot of people is really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Roles like this suit her (but others do not). Matthias Hues also did a good job, as always. He is a great fighter and a character similar to a male, and was a good opponent for Wincott in this film.
