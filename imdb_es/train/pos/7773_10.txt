Fabulous movie! I rented the DVD recently and was dazzled by this impressive work. Douglas Sirk was a film genius and gets performances from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominee) and Lauren Bacall that words can not describe. Paul Verhoeven paid a brilliant tribute to this film by having Dorothy Malone play Sharon Stone's inspiring murderous guru in his Basic Instinct. What a great joke! <br /> <br /> By turns, the film is hilarious, fascinating, corny, scathing, trashy, compelling and do not miss it! Definitely the great grandfather of all the big and small screen soap operas, but none has had the dazzling style you'll see here: the work of the camera is smooth and polished, the use of color is impressive, the aperture assembly set in the the title song is more than memorable, the unidimensional characters are unforgettable, and the final image will make you scratch your head as to how the censors backed off, then let them make the final cut. <br /> <br /> Although the oldest, very The films considered can sometimes be a boring task to sit on, Written on the Wind contains so much and it happens so fast that it's really a shame when it ends. Thanks to Mr. Sirk for the development and Todd Haynes for drawing attention to what has become one of my favorite movies of all time. SEE THIS MOVIE!
