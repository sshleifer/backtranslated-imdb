The life of bugs is a good movie. But for me, it really does not compare to movies like Toy Story and those things. Do not get me wrong, I liked this movie, but it was not as good as Toy story. The film has the visual effects, the laughs and others that Toy Story had. But the movie did not feel so ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a good movie. <br /> <br /> A life of bugs ... I do not want to say this, it's a movie I do not remember. I saw it years ago. Of course, I have not seen Toy Story in years, but I still remember it. I should not have reviewed this movie, but I am. I'm giving it a thumbs up, although it's not exactly the best job Pixar has done. <br /> <br /> The life of an error: *** / ****
