I looked at the movie today and it left me hallucinated. It's a true masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most people think it's garbage. The main idea of ​​the movie: take away your ego and you will have the true power! This was the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie has shown it in a magnificent way. "The biggest enemy will hide in the last place you'll never look." Do you remember this from the movie? Because our true enemy is in us, it is our ego ... That voice that always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, that tells us not to give, but only to take, that creates our aggression, that wants to be in control, that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts. GR expressed this idea in a surprising way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you lose control and simply let go of your personal importance. An excellent movie!
