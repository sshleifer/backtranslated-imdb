Excellent plot within a plot within a plot. It's a pity that two of my movie heroes have a good snog. It must be my education :) <br /> <br /> Very well acted by all. You never know who will overcome who. The last small turn at the end allows everyone to obtain their just deserts. <br /> <br /> We recommend everyone. A harmless tongue-in-cheek thriller that does have some flaw is probably Michael Caine's overuse of the word "bloody," but that's his signature, is not it? <br /> <br /> 9/10
