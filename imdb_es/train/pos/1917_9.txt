This was a wonderfully funny comedy with a great cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were chosen as the parents, and the children were also great. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, which was a version of Kelly Bundy's Married with Children. The writing and the presentations were first class. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series, and that slowed things down. They had to fight to change the show and bring more cast members, and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation, but they handled it well. James Garner was a good addition. It could have lasted longer if Ritter had lived. <br /> <br /> I loved it especially when they brought Ed O'Neill to a guest place. That was great. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
