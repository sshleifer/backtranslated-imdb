A bit typical of the cinematography of this era. Obviously, it was conceived for the first time in this world for the stage, but nonetheless, a very good film from beginning to end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York can do their performance on stage for the silver screen and both do it effectively. There is very little in the way of history and anyone who is not familiar with this kind of misplaced character study can be a bit disappointed. However, in general, it is a good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York manage to exaggerate.
