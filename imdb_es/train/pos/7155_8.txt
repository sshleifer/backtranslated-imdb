More than a "children's movie", "Holes" analyzes how past incidents still affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When the teenage Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day, he discovers several things about the camp and his personal connection with him. Through flashbacks, we learn that several things are closer than we realize (you will understand it better when you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a pretty good job, as do the other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.
