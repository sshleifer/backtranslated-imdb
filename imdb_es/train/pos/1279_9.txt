This movie is a funny and absolutely sarcastic vision of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed by the picture that consisted of vivid colors and sophisticated settings, especially when you think this is Zukovic's first large-scale attempt. <br /> <br /> A warning, do not take the message of the film seriously. It is not for mass consumption (and that is not a compliment). The message is a point of view of the neophyte and post-university society, something stylized. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the basic plot of a fictional editor of a magazine that verbally lashes out at the 1990s mobocracy.
