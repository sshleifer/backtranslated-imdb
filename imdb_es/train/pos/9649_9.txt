Presented at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title 'Come Undone', 25, 26 and 27 April 2001. The director of photography uses techniques that add to the narrative. Even with fall / winter funds for the "present" and spring summer for the "flashbacks," there may be some difficulties in continuing continuity. <br /> <br /> Whether the leader is gay, the actors portray the budding relationship well in real life terms; from physical violence towards the other until his passionate sexual act. The story takes the characters a bit slowly at the beginning. But as the end approaches, you really care where these guys will be next summer! You also want a sequel to discover it.
