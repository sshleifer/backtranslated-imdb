Return of the Jedi is undoubtedly the most complete action of the series, and is a good conclusion for the Star Wars saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance faces an arduous fight against the dark side, and only our favorite heroes can do it. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence, on Tatooine, we see the palace of Jabba, a well of slavery and slag, and the new home of Han Solo, while Luke and the gang prepare for their rescue, and with the Jedi powers of Luke, have the advantage. <br /> <br /> We are also witnessing a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy fight against Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields that protect the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, fight with the Imperial Fleet while waiting for the shields to fall, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An epic ending to a classic saga, and it's just the rhythm of the first two. <br /> <br /> 10/10
