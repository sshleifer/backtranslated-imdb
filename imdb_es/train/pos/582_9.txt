['As a habit, I always like to read the &#39;hated&#39; reviews of any movie. Especially one that I would like to comment on. and it is not so much a punctual counterpoint deal; I just like to see what people say on the flip side. <br /><br /> However, I want to address one thing. many people who hated him called him, paraphrasing, &#39;beautiful, but shallow&#39;, some even going so far as to say that the desire of the norm and the inability to help his brother was a mundane plot, at best cases. <br /><br /> I would like to disagree <br /><br /> As a brother of a brother who has a similar dysfunction, I can relate. daily, they see them abuse themselves, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it&#39;s not about the details of what they did when; how or why Paul decided to bet and associate with questionable people; It really is more like they are hardwired. On the one hand, they are real geniuses, and on the other, painfully self-destructive (it looks a lot like people like Howard Hughes, the same forces that drive them are the same forces that separate them) and all the time you see it, you know, and what&#39;s worse, you realize that you can not do anything about it. <br /><br /> For Norman Maclean, a river running through it was probably a way to find an answer to the reason why the tragedy had to happen and to whom it should be blamed. In the end, nobody is and, often, there is no reason why. but it takes a lot of personal anguish to really reach this realization. Sometimes it takes a lifetime. And sometimes it never comes at all.']
