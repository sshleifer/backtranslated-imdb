Although the premise of the film is quite scarce (Ollie is diagnosed with "hornophobia"), the film is a nice and pleasant little movie. It's also a bit better than the movies they did after this, probably since this was the last Laurel and Hardy movie produced by Hal Roach. In fact, it would not be a bad idea not to see ANY of his latest films, since all the chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their role exclusively for the pathos, something that the films of Laurel and Hardy would NEVER do. They had a little advantage that all subsequent films lack. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie work in a factory of horns. This sounds pretty funny, but it's not. It is not surprising that with all the racket, Ollie is about to suffer a nervous breakdown and should take some time off. The doctor (James Finlayson, in his latest film with the team) recommends a trip through the ocean. However, they do not like to sail and Stan has the idea of ​​renting a boat tied to the dock, so they can get all the sea air they want without all the hassle! Once they are in the boat, an escaped criminal gets close to the boat and they all accidentally throw themselves into the sea. Fortunately, this part of the movie actually had a good pace and the ending worked very well. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a great film by Laurel and Hardy, it was much better than many of them since it did not have annoying or distracted musical numbers (as in THE DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN TOYLAND). In addition, there is still a decent amount of physical comedy, something you almost would not see after this movie. Part of this was due to the decline in children's health (and the increase in the circumference of Ollie) and part of it was due to the general insipidity of these later films.
