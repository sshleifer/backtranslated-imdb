The film is not visually impressive in the conventional sense. It does not present a series of beautiful images. Instead, it's a visually interesting movie. It forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the different shots. This kind of thing is easy to try but hard to achieve. The film refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help the viewer less committed to understanding what is happening. Instead, the film touches and moves through a series of different genres. The trick to love the movie is to be able to enjoy this joy. I suspect that 99% of American viewers will not understand. If you try to specify the narrative of this film, the philosophical message, the symbolist structure, etc., you will waste time. There is none of this. The film only leans towards these genres and others sometimes. The only unifying force in the film is Claire Denis' own sense of what fits. There are so few feature films that come close to satisfying Kant's description of what art is, namely, the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself rather than simply subsuming experiences under concepts. The film usually takes the easy way out and opts for the simplest pleasure of understanding what is happening. Most movies are not art. Most films do not come close to art. When a film does it, as it does, and it's still pleasing to a wide variety of viewers, it's like a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes it seems to me that the film is buying in a very simplistic way the different narrative threads that run through it. The narrative of father and son of Tahiti, although not exactly conventional, ends up making things a little clear and simple. Dominate too much
