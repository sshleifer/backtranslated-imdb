"Telefilms" tends to fall into the traps of a low budget and a hasty filming program, which is why this film always tends to counteract the trend. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott embodies Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly, embracing all of his cold tendencies, and still makes him a sympathetic character. The production value of this film was exceptional, without ever depending on the special effects of boffo or the installations of the sound scene, but on the depth and clarity of the shots in situ and the strong funds. A film that is certainly alone.
