This is a wonderful movie in many ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are many producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from Disney Studio. <br /> <br /> A difference from Disney's normal fare is that this Dreamworks movie does not feature an intelligent side kick to ease comedy. And, there are no sudden moments where the characters break into a song. I am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a Disney movie: the birth of the Spirit. But it is done with good taste and is not at all offensive. "Spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong I've loved Disney for years and I'll keep doing it. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of a great animated rate. As soon as it was over, my children wanted to see him again. I had the same feeling. I recommend it totally.
