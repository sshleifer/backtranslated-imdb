You probably think that this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you see it. But if, by chance, you look at it for the second and third and fourth and fifth time (I've already reached hundreds of people), you'll find yourself spitting a line here and there and laughing at yourself! My friends and I, in fact, have launched Fear of a Black Hat Festivities to attract more of our friends, "as they say, with the riots".
