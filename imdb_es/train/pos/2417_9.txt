"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candy movies I've ever seen. Sure, it's a bit of a low budget, but it's a comic tour de force without stopping. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, when her future father-in-law asks her how much she earns, Candy says, "Oh, I'm anywhere between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh sure, it's the Candy delivery that sells it. Only classic things. Eugene Levy also becomes a hilarious performance as a filmmaker of poor quality. A clip of his horrible low budget movie "Kung Fu U" will make you roll. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can not recommend this movie enough.
