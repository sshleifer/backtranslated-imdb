Lovely Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in good shape as a middle-aged spinster whose interest turns into witchcraft in World War II in England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was approximately 51 years old at the time of the film and is ideal for her. the part. She is Jessica Fletcher again, but this time it is for the benefit of the children and for Mother England at a time of great danger. <br /> <br /> The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a teacher. of witchcraft in the attempt to obtain certain information about witchcraft. Those 3 little darlings sent to live with Price to escape the London bombings are wonderful in this lovely movie for all of us, no matter what age. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe are given very little to do in this attractive movie. <br /> <br /> I really thought about Ben Stiller's movie, "Night at the Museum", at the end of the movie, when the relics come alive to do battle. With the Nazi invasion in the small British coastal city.
