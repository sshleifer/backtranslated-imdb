This is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was when it came out. I recently saw this movie again and I still remember it. Many of the films we saw when we were younger do not seem to hold up when we see them later in life. The film is actually a great example of the 80s of the kind of movies made back then. Keaton is at his best, all the actors did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story drive the film instead of forcing it. The pace of the film is fast with few slow places and seeing the cars of the 80s is too much fun. From the 80s I loved seeing the ugly walker again. The film is a great movie for lovers of comedy and movie lovers of the 80s.
