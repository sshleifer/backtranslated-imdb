Before I saw it, there were many things against this movie. <br /> <br /> First, I was a typical high school senior, in a Shakespeare class that I really did not like, much less understood half of! Shakespeare would not be more than UNINTELLIGIBLE without me pouring ALL my concentration on his almost encrypted games ... encrypted with his extremely difficult language to understand ... and then he still would not get most of it. <br /> <br /> Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought that could be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful, that I actually understood all the language that was being made. Now, the script was followed to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in Shakespeare's class. And here was my mind opening and understanding. I was doubting myself while watching the movie! But here is that ... when it is realized, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is a teacher who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the style of great high-budget films (with a beautiful picture and photograph), and I acted in an amazing way for Brannagh and the cast, somehow ... I understood what was going on . What was said The language is impressive and passionate. It allows more raw emotion ... when words can not describe something, maybe Shakespeare's words can. <br /> <br /> I still maintain to this day that Fist of The North Star (animation, English dub) is the best movie ever made. No movie provides more pure entertainment. But for a film to come close to dethroning Fist from that position (what Hamlet did - he came up) is really amazing ... awesome. It was not a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more incredible, it made me appreciate Shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Powerful is the word. One of the rare, REALLY powerful films out there. <br /> <br /> This gets 2 billion stars of infinite stars. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all the children who are in a Shakespeare class ... forget it. You are losing your time. You have to see the plays made. Only then will justice be done.
