Returning to Chamber 36 is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies that Shaw produced in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart of Clint Eastwood in the west . Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is "Presented in Shaw Scope", as in the old days. <br /> <br /> This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, that more or less summarizes the narrative of martial arts films at that time. <br /> <br /> Act One establishes the premise. The workers of a colored mill of a small town are dissatisfied with their luck, since the Manchu gangsters cut their salary by 20%. They can not do much for their exploitation because none of them is an expert in martial arts to confront the gangsters and their boss. At first, they had a small success in getting Liu to pass himself off as a highly qualified Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but his enthusiasm was exposed when they surpassed the credibility limit by posing as one too many times. <br /> <br /> Act Two shows the protagonist who wants to return to the mafia. However, without true martial arts, he embarks on a trip to the Shaolin Temple, to try to infiltrate and learn martial arts in secret. After a few moments of slapstick, he is finally accepted by the abbot (who was impersonated as a personification!), But he is disappointed by the teaching methods, something like Mr. Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he manages to erect scaffolding around the temple. . Nothing can stop a good man, and unknowingly build strength, resistance and learn kung fu in an unorthodox way. <br /> <br /> The third act is where the fight festival begins. With cheesy sound effects, each non-contact evident in the film receives the maximum impact treatment. But it's quite refreshing to see the fight scenes here, with their wide angle shots to highlight the clarity and detail between the training partners, and the use of slow motion only to show tricks at different angles. The speed of the fights may be a bit slow, with some pauses between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style used ad nausem in Hollywood movies, they certainly do not do the fight scenes as they used to! Go back to camera 36. On Monday the screening test is repeated, so if you are ready for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what do you expect?
