A famous orchestra conductor, Daniel Dareus, suffers what appears to be a heart attack when he finishes directing a concert. Suddenly, we observe him when he arrives at the small town that he left behind years ago. Since he left so young, and changing his name helps to give him a new person. He has bought the old school building where he plans to stay. The building needs a lot of work. One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left to be installed in his new abode, but no, Daniel endures the harsh winter in his own way. <br /> <br /> The local pastor, Stig, whose church has a small choir, comes to see if Daniel could be interested to help, but the director has no desire to return to music. Daniel begins to explore his new universe. The people of the village leave him alone. She is impressed by Lena, who works at the local store where she goes to look for her food. Little by little, he approaches and decides to get involved with the choir. Lena will finally fall in love with Daniel. <br /> <br /> At first, the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected. As they know him better, they come to accept him and make him one of them. Your new position does not endear you to the woman who used to be in charge. The choir members are a diverse group, but they realize the change Daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs. The new piece composed by Gabriella, a battered wife, has a great impact on her life and on that of her fellow singers. <br /> <br /> Daniel's ideas for the repertoire clash with those of Stig himself. The vicar suddenly begins to see Daniel in a new light; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love with his wife, Siv. His ideas collide with dogma, as Siv points out. Stig decides to try to put an end to what he considers an unhealthy influence of Daniel by dismissing him as head of the choir. <br /> <br /> The choir, which has been invited to participate in a contest, travels to Austria. . Daniel, who has already fallen completely in love with Lena, has the opportunity to show her feelings for her for the first time in her life when she begins to have doubts about their relationship. Daniel, who is late for his own concert, listens to them make extraordinary music, although he is not among them. <br /> <br /> Kay Pollak, the director of this hugely attractive film, proves that he was the man to direct it. History involves the viewer from the beginning. Much of the success of the film is due to the cast that was put together. William Nykvist, who plays the lead role, is the best excuse to watch the movie. Frida Hallgren, Niklas Falk, Ylva Loof, do an excellent job for Mr. Pollak. <br /> <br /> Stefan Nilsson is the composer of most of the beautiful music that one hears. The cinematography of Harald Gunnar Paalgard makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in its beauty.
