I was lucky to see this in a pre-selection last night (October 20) and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and really acted like a heart acting. <br /> <br /> While the plot is not particularly complicated or Exceptionally new, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique and clearly "indy" in style. It's not something that can easily be compared to movies from the past, it's a unique version of a kind of classic love story of middle-aged depression. <br /> <br /> I was especially surprised at the casting of the movie. . Until the last extra in the family, he was a beautiful and talented cast. The three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent dispersed evenly among them and none of them "surpassed" the other two. <br /> <br /> It was really a lovely movie, appropriate for all ages and laughs. Funny scream while it is also truly touching and comforting. It was a wonderful break from the sexual jokes and nudity of recent movies.
