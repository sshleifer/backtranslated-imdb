I waited until July 4 to write this because. . . all right . . . because it feels good to do it on this day. <br /> <br /> In 1924 D.W. Griffith needed a hit, he had not had a big one since ORPHANS OF THE STORM (1921). He had been working constantly since then, but his films had a smaller scope and had not been successful with the public. He was planning a film about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by members of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) who asked him if he could expand his ideas to include more of the American Revolution. This movie is the result. By the time he finished, he had a 14-reel history lesson and there was no trace of Patrick Henry anywhere. <br /> <br /> We all know the history of the War of Independence, but Griffith launched a love story with patriotic farmer Nathan (Neil Hamilton) falls in love with the aristocrat Tory Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster, one of the protagonists of Griffith for many years). Complicating things is the fact that Nancy's father hates Nathan. . . Well, not only Nathan, he hates all the rebels. It's no good when, during a skirmish in the streets of Lexington, someone pushes Nathan's arm causing him to shoot his gun and accidentally boil Nancy's father. <br /> <br /> Paralyzing the love story is the (mostly true, but partially embellished, story of Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore) a renegade British officer who feels he owes no loyalty to anyone. Indians who form the Six Nations on their side, hopes to crush the colonial and become monarch of their own empire. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) are inevitable.The Montague family could be that of Cameron from the previous film, while Nathan could be part of the Stoneman family.The sequence of the Battle of Bunker Hill is organized in a very similar way to a scene in BIRTH OF A NATION with the attacking army, in this case the Redcoats, assaulting a ditch full of Patriots, the only thing missing is Henry Walthall, who charges through the no man's land to put a flag in the barrel of a cannon.Surprisingly, the battle scenes in the United States seem like a ecer the energy of the battle scenes in BIRTH and do not attract the audience. Something is clearly missing. It is not the scope, G.W. The camera work of "Billy" Bitzer is pretty good. Maybe what is missing is. . . I dare say it. . Sincerity? <br /> <br /> The brutality of Captain Butler and his men is well underlined, although much of this happens remotely or off-screen. Do not expect heads to be cut in the foreground as we saw in INTOLERANCE (1916). In one scene, Butler's second in command, Captain Hare (Louis Wolhiem) shakes the eyes of a captive settler. We only see the beginning of writing, while the rest of the camera focuses on Hare's face, since he obviously has a good time doing this. Lionel had been working with Griffith intermittently since 1912. According to the story, he approached Griffith to work and for D.W., knowing the reputation of his famous family, he said: "I'm not hiring theater actors." to which Lionel replied "And I'm nothing like that, sir!" He is a very good and very credible villain. Louis Wolhiem appeared three times with Lionel's older brother, John; in SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (both 1920) and later in THE TEMPEST (1927). As the captain. Hare, his wild-eyed eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain, but also makes you think he's pretty angry. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton commented later that America was his first time on horseback and "I was scared to death." However, he conceals his displeasure very well and we can believe that he was already quite equestrian when the shooting finished. Mr. Griffith was very much in love with Carol Dempster and at one point asked him to marry him. She refused and soon left her corporation, after which her star status gradually decreased. <br /> <br /> Speaking of horses, an accidentally funny moment that had to be declassified came during the description of Paul Revere's trip. Ride his horse on the porch of a family to announce "To the guns! The regulars are coming!" But while trying to leave the horse he can not negotiate the backward steps and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground! I'm surprised that Griffith did not make another shot. <br /> <br /> So is it a classic of the United States? YES! Do not wait until July 4 to see it, it's nice at any time.
