Most people could say that if one spent a Saturday night watching a movie, it must be really boring. Actually, I had just returned home after being out and turned on the television and there it was, "Paulie." <br /> <br /> I missed the first credits, so I did not know the name, but I saw that I had Cheech Marin, so naturally I thought I had tuned in "Born In East L.A." When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, he was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late at night. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to say it was better than that. As you know, if you have not done it yet, Paulie is lost and tries to return to its original owner. It seems that it has taken years to find her. What should be Paulie's advantage is actually a disadvantage in the ways. People encounter a literate parrot and everything they see is a way to earn money or benefit themselves. <br /> <br /> While the character of Cheech Marin "is" making money with him, it's not bad with him. The dance sequences with the parrots are something that the children will find cute, I found them fun. <br /> <br /> Paulie, who is na√Øve, quickly learns that not all humans are good people. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man lies to him telling him that he will help him to find his owner whenever he helps him in his investigation of communications with animals. Paulie is now stuck, but decides to cheat the man in a demonstration to others of Paulie's vocal ability. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paulie tells his story to the facility janitor who ends up releasing him, several other animals and finding the location of Paulie's owner. It is a moving meeting. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the wing trimming scene should have been assumed and not shown. That part could bother the smallest children. Otherwise, it is a great movie for older children and adults who are children at heart. (FINISH)
