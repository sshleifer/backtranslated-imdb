When I saw this film for the first time, in London, in 1958, I was speechless. I've never seen a movie like this before. It had a strange and hypnotic effect, very different from the movies I had seen before and had a lasting impact. <br /> <br /> I think Odile Versios and Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. Certainly, the interaction is amazing because of its power to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If it has been converted to DVD, in Region 2 format, and in the original language in French, I would love to know and where it can be purchased.
