ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> directed by: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> starring: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg <br /> <br /> Argument: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her TV show and heads to the small Christian town of Fallwell, Massachusettes to pick up her dead aunt's inheritance, hoping to earn a lot of money to open a show in Las Vegas . Unfortunately for her, all she gets is a chilling old house, a poodle and a magical cookbook. While in Fallwell, Elvira tries to earn money, instill some life into the teenagers, win the heart of a stallion (Daniel Greene), avoid burning at the stake and keep her uncle's cookbook creepy (W. Morgan Sheppard ). who plans to use the book to end the world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman, and like Elvira is all that morbid and naively fun, not to mention that she has a couple of amazing door knockers. In this film, its charms are well used. <br /> <br /> I loved the 'fish out of water' feeling in the movie. You have Elvira, in her black low cut dress, her big black hair and her huge "twins", and she is in a Christian city where most of the girls are not even allowed to wear makeup. This also makes his love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is as good as Elvira's uncle / nemesis, Vincent, who steals the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence, but still he does not get in the way and steals scenes from Elvira. <br /> <br /> What really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes. Everything, from jokes and jokes of terror, is here and makes me laugh much more than anything in a sequel to SCARY MOVIE. I heard there are about 56 jokes in this movie, and any fan of horror films B by Roger Corman will love the fakes in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you will love this movie.
