Young Mr. Lincoln marks the first film of the director / collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember that years ago, Fonda told me that, as a young actor, he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and was afraid he was not up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford before the filming began reassured him. saying that he was not going to play the Grand Emancipator, but a lawyer on the prairie. Once solved, Fonda directed a cast that John Ford directed to a classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not a Lincoln biopic. That had happened earlier in the era of sound with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey made the winning work of the Pulitzer Prize of Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey is still the definitive Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda was not playing the Grand Emancipator, but a lawyer from a small town in Illinois. The film covers about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him working in a general store, getting some law books from a family of pioneer immigrants whose path he would cross again later in history. And his romance with Ann Rutledge with his early death left Lincoln as a very melancholy being. <br /> <br /> I went for about 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing lawyer who starts receiving some notification. He has served a couple of terms in the legislature, but is back in private practice not quite sure if the policy is for him. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the action takes place. The two sons of that family had received the law books from when they were accused of murder. He offers to defend them. And not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The trial itself is fiction, but the tactic used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who played with the two sons, is based on a real case that Lincoln defended. I will not say anything else. <br /> <br /> Aside from the performances, the great strength of Young Mr. Lincoln is the way in which John Ford captures the atmosphere and the atmosphere and the environment of a small town of meadows of Illinois in a Celebration Room of July. It's almost like you're watching a newscast. And it was the environment of the country itself, young, vibrant and growing. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford films will recognize two musical themes that were repeated in later films. During the romantic interlude at the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore, who played Ann Rutledge, the background music is the same theme that was used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And in a dance, the Lovely Susan Brown tune played by Fonda and Marjorie Weaver who plays Mary Todd is the same one with which Fonda danced with Cathy Downs, in My Darling Clementine, at the church dance in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will always be a favorite subject of biographers and dramatists for two reasons, I think. The first is that he is the living embodiment of our own American mythology about people ascending from the bottom up to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts. In fact, the young Mr. Lincoln shows very graphically the background from which Lincoln came. And secondly, the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in the history of the United States and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free the slaves during the Civil War, although for some necessary political reasons. His murder secured its place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others I have mentioned, special praise should also go to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two crazy people of the city, Kohler is the victim of the murder and Bond the main accuser. Also Donald Meek as prosecutor and Alice Brady in what turned out to be her last film as the pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very good performance by Spencer Charters who specialized in rustic characters like the judge. <br /> <br /> For a movie that captures the drama and romance of the time, you can not do better than Young Mr. Lincoln.
