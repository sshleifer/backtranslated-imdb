['This is a pretty decent example of black cinema. The scenario is in the early 50&#39;s with the communists trying to steal weapons secrets to the government of the United States. <br /><br /> Richard Widmark is the unscrupulous soft pickpocket. It gives a pretty decent performance, but there&#39;s nothing A-List about it. The interesting thing was that not only was he an antihero, but for most of the movie, an unpleasant antihero. That is not very normal. Jean Peters gave a regular performance as the slut with the heart of gold. That great character of the actress Thelma Ritter shines like the dove. <br /><br /> The plot had its fair share of twists and turns, jokes and difficult conversations. There is a fight scene near the end of the movie (at the subway station) that was quite rough and exciting. <br /><br /> I think noir fans (like me) will enjoy this movie. For viewers who are not from noir, it may seem a little outdated and the whole Commie issue a bit exaggerated.']
