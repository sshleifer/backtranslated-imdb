This is the first movie I've seen of John Singleton and he's a very good director. The film begins with a group of freshmen and shows what happens to several of them. Omar Epps plays a star of the track with a partial scholarship and finds it difficult to keep up with his work. He is a friend of Ice Cube and beings who are dating Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who has been raped and befriends Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian, and is not sure which way to go. Michael Rapaport is a boy from Idaho who falls with a group of Neo-Nazis and their leader is Cole Hauser. Those are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science who tries to help them. It's a great movie and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts in the movie.
