Read the various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I love this movie, although I only have a video version dubbed in Japanese. <br /> <br /> Apparently, many critics seem to consider it negative that the premise of the story has been used before, most famous in the great "It's a wonderful life". For me, a great premise is a great premise no matter how many times it is used, and I would love to see more films using this particular premise: the unhappy man who has the opportunity to gain a new perspective on his own life. through a little "divine magic". <br /> <br /> I suppose that people and critics of a more intellectual inclination are not so dragged into history, but I do not go to the cinema to criticize them with a notebook in hand - I go to the cinema to get into them and let them take me where they want. <br /> <br /> If you are sentimental like me, you will be well rewarded by seeing this image. The performances are excellent at all times, and the film was very well cast. Wonderful music choice, too. Michael Caine is excellent as the friendly waiter. Jim Belushi does a great job as the kind of "average Joe" who wonders if his life has not gone as it should. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, is again on target here as the loving wife. Jon Lovitz entertains as usual, and even has some surprisingly poignant moments in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a Wonderful Life", but says he has to do it. be? Taken on their own terms, "Mr. Destiny" is a fun, well made, funny and moving movie. I've seen my video folded in Japanese many times, and I'm sure I'll see it several more times. If that somehow makes me a "lowbrow", so be it! I'm glad I did not read any reviews of "Mr. Destiny" before I saw it. <br /> <br /> I guess I should have the courage of my convictions and give the movie nine or ten stars, but I could not help but hesitate after reading all the reviews!
