I do not know how and where the Iranian directors are inspired to come up with an argument like this. In fact, it is a very simple argument that many directors could create, but they can not project it in a movie like Jafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The film is like 2 rotating worlds at the same time, one connected to the other: the football match and the battle between the sexes that takes place behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> It makes you feel like you're in the movie and you're one of the characters, and as you watch the movie, as if you also want to take a look at the football game. You will feel exactly the same emotion and feelings as those female actresses in the movie. It's exciting in a way that you wanted to see the end, you want to know the verdict, you'll die to see what will happen to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like the intermittent conversations between the smoker and one of the military trainees. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to obtain equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is the second Jafar Panahi movie I've seen (the first is Crimson Gold) and I'm looking forward to seeing a little more. <br /> <br /> I'm already hooked on Iranian films, and this is a must!
