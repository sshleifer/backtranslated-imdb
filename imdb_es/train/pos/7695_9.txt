Good Times was an innovative comedy about the first nuclear black family that lives in the Chicago projects. Whether you live in the cities of the interior, in the ghettos, in the suburbs or in rural areas, this show is still a treasure to see and observe a family as a family instead of a show about a poor family of black race. But do not stop at it. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the behind-the-scenes story, it was worth keeping this show up in the air, except that I did not like them killing the father, which was in line with Esther Rolle, who fought to keep the family together. But despite all the behind-the-scenes fighting, Good Times was a show about a family. We all love JJ's dynamite and its antics. We saw Janet Jackson's penny grow. This show was innovative to show desperation with drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without being a preacher, the Evans always tried to do the right thing instead of doing something bad to get out of the ghetto.
