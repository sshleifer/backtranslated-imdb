Very well done the movie. It stays in your memory. Better cataloged as a romance than flying or a war, although the flying parts are realistic and almost without mistakes. Fans who fly like me will enjoy this movie even if they are attracted to airplanes, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Fun to see Crowe from the beginning. He is good and exudes charm. His reading of "High Flight" is excellent. <br /> <br /> greetings, Boom
