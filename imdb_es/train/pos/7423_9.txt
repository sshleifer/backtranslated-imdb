['I recently saw the &#39;54 version of this movie with Judy, and although I appreciated the story and the music, I discovered that the movie did not get my attention. I expected the &#39;76 remake to be the same story, except with a touch of Barbra. I was pleasantly surprised, it was a much more realistic and modern look of fame, money, love and the price of everything. This version is much more real than that of &#39;54, with better music, better acting, a more exciting plot and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is on the list of the 100 best of the American Film Institute, while this new version fails to leave a mark on the list of any critic.']
