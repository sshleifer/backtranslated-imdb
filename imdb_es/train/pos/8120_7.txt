Things to Come is an early science fiction film that shows an imagined world, or "Everytown" for 100 years. You can divide it into approximately 4 scenes or different parts. The film runs from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the "Boss" wanted to get the ability to fly in planes again, after Everytown was bombed and the war broke out. <br /> <br /> This movie only has around 3 faults: its audio is cloudy and the video has some peculiarities, the characters are not completely deep and the general plot is not entirely solid. The plot lacks something about what I can not point out ... it just seems a little "fluffy". But if you like science fiction and are interested in what H.G. Wells could have happened in the next hundred years, this is something you should see. It is worth seeing only to know what everyone feared: a long and protracted war, because they were about to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and all that. <br /> <br /> Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.
