In my opinion, this has to be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances. She was one of the few actors, then and now, who could say more with a single glance than a whole page of dialogue. And I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored film, with the additional 4 minutes of additional images. Too bad the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman who barely keeps him working for her father in his illegal underground. His only link to anything is his good friend, Chico, played wonderfully by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is African American (and a white woman is the best friend of a black woman in the 30s was as controversial as the subject of this film), and Lily is not, have a special bond. And it is not sexual. Only 2 women got in, or pushed, in a situation beyond their control. After Lily's father dies, and she does not know what she will do, they tell her that she has the power to go out and get what she wants. Yes, it is immoral, but that is the central point of this film. Then "they" had to leave and ruin the last minutes. So, until the last minutes of the movie, it's an excellent movie and it's worth seeing. The "lesson" of the film is still as valid today as it was back then, and I am sure that in 100 years. Women, it's horrible what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, take note.
