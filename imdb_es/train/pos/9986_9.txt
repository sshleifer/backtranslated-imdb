As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought about adding my comments. Watching the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film. The characters have so many complexities that everyone can relate to them in their own way. The brilliance of adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions into the lives of the characters, instead of feeding on an opinion. You can love or dislike them, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. The wonderful performances of Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I highly recommend it
