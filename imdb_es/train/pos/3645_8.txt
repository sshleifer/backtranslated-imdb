['A good story about how to follow your dreams and actually try to do something about it when the possibility arises. It was not easy for Morris either, he had a family, a job, an employment office, a mortgage, etc., it was not like he could let go of what he was doing and jump happily to the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months . It took guts. I&#39;m glad they showed their indecision, almost until the call came to the majors. <br /><br /> I remember that I saw him pitching against the Red Sox (I think ...), it was a great story. Although Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or Mills Watson than Quaid, that&#39;s fine. <br /><br /> Quaid does a very good job interpreting the man, the teacher, the coach and the &quot;oldest rookie&quot; ... As someone belonging to the same age group, I can certainly identify with his difficult situation. You are not too old to do what you had dreamed when you were a child, but it is coming. You have to do it before lator. <br /><br /> Well said, well edited, with rhythm, he acted, it was good to see the familiar faces of the deceased Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /><br /> Good job everywhere, I&#39;m glad to see you beaten. <br /><br /> What would have thought that the Devil Rays of Tampa would have been the subject of a good movie from the beginning?']
