The film and acting above average are partly spoiled by its completely predictable story. Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action each time.

His description of the tragedy of the company's cities and the lack of upward mobility is incomplete but moving. Chris Cooper delivers a first class performance as Howard's coal mining dad.
