"Someone at the door." OHHH, how I miss this show so much ... but we are lucky to have "Invasion" now. Thanks, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, I had it all. If I had to choose one of the things that I liked the most about the show, it has to be their "unpredictable plot". The favorite actor was Lucas Black. I love that southern accent. I bought the DVD as soon as possible, and my children are also fans. There are some hot and smoking scenes. Some diabolics too. Therefore, if the kiddos will be watching, you may want to edit (fast forward / jump). He has humor, on a level of Joss Wheedon, which so many shows lack. Adult ingenuity and adult situation, which are handled with Finnish. The DVD has some extras, but I would like to have many more. If you want to get excited and enjoy a great show, come see "American Gothic"!
