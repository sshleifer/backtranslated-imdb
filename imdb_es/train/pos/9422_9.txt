When I heard about the death of Sir Alec Guinness, this was the first of his many films that I thought I would see again. What a wonderful funny comment that the film provides even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the charm in each frame. His eyes and face are as bright as the white suit he wears. Both he and the film should be considered favorites for life.
