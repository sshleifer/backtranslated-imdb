['Located in a middle-class neighborhood in the imaginary city of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch plays with American obsessions such as mania and violence with weapons, materialism and the pace of the Joneses, the fear of others, slavery, golf and the disposition of the dead. Yes, everything sounds a bit heavy, but trust me, it&#39;s almost as light as a feather. <br /><br /> Zombies stand out among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of Willard&#39;s people choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many zombies to fulfill their orders as robots (have they become a social status brand)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be established between the living and the kind of reincarnated dead? <br /><br /> Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the animated screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this unlikely material that filters for an hour and a half without once faltering for lack of good laugh. A super cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the directors, aided by the young K&#39;Sun Ray as Timmy, the good-hearted innocent child who Acts as a fair witness of all the madness of adults. (Having seen her only in &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;, she had no idea that Mrs. Moss had such good comedies). <br /><br /> The production design and music are exquisitely 50, to date. Maybe this is not for everyone. Surely it will be a difficult movie to beat for my annual Bizarro prize. But smart comedies that stay entertaining from beginning to end are among the hardest achievements to win in movie making. For me anyway, &quot;Fido&quot; is a hoot! My grades: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (Viewed 1/30/07)']
