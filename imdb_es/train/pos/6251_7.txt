It's nothing bright, innovative or innovative, but 'Dog Days' is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study. It's as if CRASH is triggered by a bad dose of heroin, but not really. It is an Austrian film that follows the lives of several depressed, upset and upset people and their abusive relationships with each other. It is disturbing, but very well acted and it is interesting to see the little crazy things that these characters do. Certainly not for the faint of heart, this highly pessimistic film offers no conclusion or revelation at the end, we only see the lives of these sordid individuals over the course of two days.
