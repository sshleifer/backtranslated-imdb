I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend and, wow! I had already seen the first two movies and I liked them, but Ultimatum, I loved them. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a CIA agent who suffers an amnesia, trying to figure out who he is. <br /> <br /> As I said, I loved this movie from the beginning to the end, without frames, slow scenes, everything went perfectly and it fit well with the other movies, but in every way it was much better . <br /> <br /> The best acrobatics, car chases, actors and effects I've seen in an action movie all summer, (surprisingly due to Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) But it was not like that . Only action in this movie, Jason not only kills and runs. He has a soul and the audience feels for him, so the drama is included. But that does not slow it down. <br /> <br /> Of all the "three times" that came out last summer, this was the best.
