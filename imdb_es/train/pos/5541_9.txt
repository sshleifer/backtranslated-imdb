A highly atmospheric cheapie, which shows great ingenuity in the use of accessories, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create a mysterious and changing texture. The story is implausible, the performance is merely functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop a complete visual narrative. This movie is recommended because of its mood and texture, not because of its history.
