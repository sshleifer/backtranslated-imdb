I rented this movie from a box office hit on a whim ... I like Alan Arkin and the cover was stuck ... I read the back and knew right away that it was going to be the best or the worst movie I've seen ... I guess I was lucky ... I laughed from beginning to end ... Alan Arkin brings a great character to this movie. Since then, I have purchased a used rental copy for my own collection and see it all the time. I have recommended this movie to a lot of people and everyone enjoyed it as much as I do ... I see complaints about the menus and the DVD. it works ... but it does not take away from the movie ... the disk was created for Blockbuster exculsivley, so they did not allow you to skip the previews ... apart from that, you should not let the DVD functions to dissuade you from See the excellent movie.
