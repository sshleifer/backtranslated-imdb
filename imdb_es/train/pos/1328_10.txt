Without the "mental anachronism", this film that I would like to find on DVD offers an extraordinary immersion in the vital and mental context of the people's thinking about the "disenchantment of the world". That, there are thirty years, a director and a writer of scenarios could try one of those empathies and a truth so romantic to do it. The masterpiece leaves me amazed. It would be necessary to be able to see and reexamine the film to take better advantage of the temporal and cultural distance that allows us to lose the capacity to be understood, analyzed and finally accept this or that example of "primitive thought". "Because this thought is almost impossible to feel in the secularized world, it contains certain keys to our behavior that only future generations can analyze with sufficient relevance If someone knows where I can get a digital or VHS copy for me or a DVD? Thanks in advance.
