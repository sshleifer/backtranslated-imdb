Chocolat by Claire Denis is a beautiful but frustrating movie. The film presents a very interesting look to the family of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly inadequate. For example, a central theme in the story is the inability of young France to establish strong relationships with others. Although this performance runs smoothly, especially in the way Denis frames the story with scenes of France's return to childhood home, the girl's lack of intimacy with the other characters in the film makes it difficult for her to a viewer investing a lot of interest in its development (or lack of it) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of the character's development of the film makes it difficult to commit to the freely organized plot. The film generates a lot of tension between the characters, particularly between Aimee and the men in his life, but he never fully addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer dissatisfied. The last scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis' work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you are looking for a movie with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best option.
