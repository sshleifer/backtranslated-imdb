I saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and I thought it was extremely smart, elegant and FUN. <br /> <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Weird, I found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it. <Br /> <br /> The writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie on many political subtexts, but they did not hit you in the head with this. <br /> <br /> The world they created had depth, and it made sense. There is a vertiginous carnivorous spirit in this movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to cure bad mood. <br /> <br /> I loved it!
