Very few chess movies have been made in recent years, but this is more than just a chess movie, it's a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it. John Toturro plays a man with psychological problems, it does not matter. for him, he accepts 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game validates him as a person, when he loses a game he loses what makes sense for him and John Torturro expresses it in a beautiful way, even a woman's love was not enough to save him of his sad existence. It makes you wonder if there are other Luzon who are obsessed with the game, I'm sure they are, if you're a chess enthusiast, it will not hurt to see it. It is an intelligent piece of work well designed and executed correctly, achieves its objectives, unfortunately, I doubt there is a sequel.
