"Home Room" as "Zero Day" and "Elephant", were inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those who died) after a shootout. Making it less exploitative and more useful because little effort is spent asking questions for which there are no answers. <br /> <br /> Do not give up on this little movie for the first 20 minutes, it's supposed to be established. Even the real story, but it plays like an episode of "Hill Street Blues" rejected. It is lame but it supports with that, at least it fills the sufficient length so that the film is classified like a characteristic. I recommend omitting this completely and simply jumping into the hospital scenes, there's nothing here that you can not grasp from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like many good movies, this was a creative one-man show like Paul F. Ryan was both the writer and the director. While this arrangement does not guarantee a good movie, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unit of construction and execution that often lacks dramatic large-budget features. Because the script of "Home Room" is his true strength, it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and assured that his vision came to the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan has a great chance with the end that tests the tolerance limits of sentimentality of the average viewer. It runs to the edge, but against all logic, it leaves you crying instead of shrinking. The reason why the ending works is a combination of the public's need to get a reward at the end of this type of trip, the song ("Sweet Surrender" by Sarah McLaughlin) comes out, and the amazing last-minute edition. <Br /> <br /> The other strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as main characters. Although Phillips plays his standard alienated teenager and Christensen, his intelligent daughter of a good family, both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What is happening here is all about the two despite an unconvincing story about a police detective who asks about the city trying to link Alice to the lone shooter. If you ever cut and trim the film, this parallel story must be condensed. <br /> <br /> A story about two extremely disparate girls coming together and helping each other is not a new idea and Ryan could easily have directed this movie. In clich√© and predictability. But instead, their script leads them to participate in a fascinating and compelling combat combat, that they get rid of each other and share moments of vulnerability, only to withdraw within themselves. Deanna's line "I'm dying inside" just tear you apart, I can not think of any time in any other movie that I felt so intensely like that. She desperately needs a connection that Alicia desperately resists. Deanna only progresses when she retires. The spectator is still waiting for the group hug that never seems to happen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this not only generates a lot of suspense but it leaves you admiring the two characters and the two actresses that gave them life. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
