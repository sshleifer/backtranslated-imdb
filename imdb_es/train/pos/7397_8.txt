"Xizao" is the story about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father, Liu (Xu Zhu), has died. He finds his father still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his father's old business, the public restroom. <br /> <br /> The film centers around Da Ming's family, and how he has to learn the importance of his father's work, something that had always considered an old tradition that he had to die soon. In addition, the film explores his relationship with Er Ming, who has mental problems, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the film, the family and the problems of progress, are handled incredibly well, and the film never loses the point it tries to make, both themes are very well developed and we have a vision of Chinese society and customs. . <br /> <br /> The director, Yang Zhang, tells his story in a simple way, letting the characters do the work. It's a very simple approach, but it fits perfectly into the movie, and I doubt very much that another style fits the movie so well. Zhang has enormous potential, since he can tell a story without the help of visual flashes or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> The performance is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and almost looks like if they were real people being filmed. The three main characters provide remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang, like Er Ming, surely steals the show. <br /> <br /> Even when the film might have stuck to a message "the old days were much better", instead of that An attitude of balance, like saying that progress is good, and we must move forward, but We must not forget where we came from, and maintain a balance between modern life and the traditions of yesteryear. <br /> <br />, and play the movie. 8/10
