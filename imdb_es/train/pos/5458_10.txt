I enjoyed this movie very much. I thought the plot of the film was realistic and relevant to any period of American history. There is always that woman who does what she has to do to scale the class system. I feel that Lilly's character was represented correctly and that it could not have been done better. What I enjoyed the most was when she realized what love really was. Throughout the film, all the men who fell in love with her were in love with her, they had given her everything, they had even lost their careers for her. Until he met Cortland, he did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness. The way her life had ended was far from what she hoped would be possible. I would recommend this movie to any of a mature audience so you can understand the content and the underlying meaning of the movie and the plot.
