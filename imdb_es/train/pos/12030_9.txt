Hi, I'm Scott (A.K.A. woody7739). I love the movie Twisted Desire, and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart on TV, as I think she's fine. I'm also a true sabrina fan, the teenage witch, so this helped me see it (do not ask). I love the way Nicole plans the murder of her parents very carefully, as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles, so she will not give away her fingerprints (a very well planned idea). all counterproductive in nicole when they caught her when her old boyfriend comes up and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. I give this movie a nine out of ten, and I put it on the list of the 10 best movies. And last but not least, if someone sees this movie in stores, tell me how I saw it on TV and I did not record it. goodbye
