I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger; At first, when that woman (Sarah) was full of terror when she was slipping, I thought it was a scary scene, because I would think that when you see that, your nerves in your body affect you because it fills you with fear and your heart beats more Quick. I liked seeing Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he will be known as the one who plays Rambo and Rocky.
