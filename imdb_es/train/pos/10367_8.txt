When I first saw "A cry in the dark", I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was surprised by what it represented. When I saw it for the second time in an Australian film class, I realized a second point: communication problems. You see, when a dingo caught the baby of Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) felt distressed but they did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted this to happen, and so they could not cry. But when people across Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone began to believe that Lindy had done it herself. <br /> <br /> The point is that the wrong message was communicated to the public and put people against Lindy. Even though this was a pure accident, it still happened. It can be one of the greatest disasters arising from the existence of the media, regardless of the political views of any means of communication. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (not surprising there), and Sam Neill is equally great. You will probably be impressed by what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best films.
