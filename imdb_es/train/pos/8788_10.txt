Well, I'm delighted to hear a rumor that this can finally be aired on DVD. When that happens, I do not know, but I'll do it when it's released. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining film, especially when the ring race of "Gentleman Jim" Corbett begins in the film. Then go from a good movie to an excellent one. <br /> <br /> Few people could play arrogant men and still become a nice guy as nice as Flynn, and this movie is a perfect example of that. Reportedly, this was Flynn's favorite role and I believe that. You can feel how much fun it was having here. Ward Bond also seems to be really enjoying his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond, too, was never better. <br /> <br /> Here's the right amount of boxing action scenes and they're pretty well done, too. It is also fun to see Corbett's family as they continue in the stands during Jim's matches. Outside the arena, the arguments and constant cries of the Corbett family may be a little too loud and annoying, but they set the stage for an appropriate conclusion. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the great The fight is very moving and the highlight of the film. Some mischievous critics (Variety, for example) did not like that ending or the fact that much of the film is fictional, but most of the films are fictional, like it or not. And, in this case, it was a good story and a good ending. (In real life, Corbett was a true soft-spoken gentleman, not like Flynn's portrait, but Flynn still makes him a good guy). <br /> <br /> This is one of the most entertaining classic movies that I have. I have seen and I am eagerly waiting for the DVD.
