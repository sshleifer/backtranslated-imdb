['I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen years old when this movie came out and I was able to relate. This will be a film that I will show my children so they know that the feelings they are having are normal. It&#39;s funny to see how we can be so devalued by things at such a young age ... that they knew we would recover ... again and again ... Great movie !!!!']
