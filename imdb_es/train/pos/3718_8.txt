This was a good movie. It was not your typical war movie but something a little different. This movie showed us the recruits in training before the war and not really fighting a war. This movie is one of the most realistic views on war and the army that most other movies like this one. Colin Farrel did a great job of portraying an army recruit, Clifton Collins Jr. and also Matthew Davis contributed reasonably well. Seeing Colin Farrel move from one qualification to another in a few years, I would never think what would happen. I will also add that the creators of tigerland did a great job of filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a nice touch. It's good to see that talent is used wisely and I hope to see this talent again in the near future.
