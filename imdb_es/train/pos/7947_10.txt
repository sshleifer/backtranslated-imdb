I watched this movie so many times through my children's hood that even today I can see the whole dialogue. And when I see it now, it only makes me happy and, surprisingly, I'm still laughing. I think it's amazing how they managed to train the animals, especially the cat, to the extent that they can play the main role of a movie. However, seeing it now, unfortunately I can also notice that it is not the masterpiece I once thought it was. But I prefer to remember how I felt when I was younger watching it on VHS on my first TV that clouded the image in yellow. And considering that it's a movie for children, that's why I would definitely give it 10/10.
