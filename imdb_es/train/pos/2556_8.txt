And a movie made for television too, this movie was good. The acting in it and the plot was so great. This is one of the only movies I've seen that I felt skewed in my mind because after watching it I was afraid that Reaper would come to kill me through the screen of my computer. There were some small things wrong with this movie, but it is very easy to see. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr. played an excellent role in this film together with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This movie just has a lot of suspense and made me want more because I never thought that a low budget television movie could be so powerful. After seeing this, I read the novel on which this movie was based (four times) and it was also great. If you ever see this movie on television, I would see it. The effects in this movie were pretty good, I honestly do not know how a human calcifying live would be, but with the way the FX team made this movie, it impressed me and all it shows is that all this is wrong for movies of TV. Out there with low budgets should not be so bad. <br /> <br /> Look at it. It's really good, not really, it is!
