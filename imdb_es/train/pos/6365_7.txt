This highly derivative film will be entertaining for the many who have not seen some of the darker anime movies. I enjoyed most of it, especially after the fairly flat opening minutes at the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very entertaining and includes some of the best animation clips). James Garner as the Commander and Leonard Nimoy as the King give impressive performances.
