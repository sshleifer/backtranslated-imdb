* Mark where there are spoilers! General comments: If you can take a serious movie, go see this. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Do not leave the theater because you get confused with what is happening! The film fits very well in the second half. I will take my mother to see her again when the movie officially opens. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago, when Will was promoting the movie. He was great, he spent a lot of time with the fans. Thanks for the photo Will! About Will's performance: many times when you watch a movie with a really famous actor for some other movie / show, you always think of them in their current performance as you think of them in their previous performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie. I did not imagine Prince Cool (lol) when I was watching this movie. He was totally and absolutely convincing in this very, very serious role. He has grown immensely as an actor. I think at least you'll get a nod to the Oscar for this performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very conflicted and tormented. He's sad ... guilty ... very determined, but very scared. Very faithful to himself. His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow, Will managed to give it life. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a good job of portraying Emily, a woman very behind with her. taxes. Maybe she is not the bright star that Will is in this movie, but it was very convincing. I think his character did not have as much to work with as Will's. <br /> <br /> About the plot (without spoilers): I admit that I did not like the movie until the second half. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie that was going to come in, and nothing made sense until the second part of the movie. But when things finally fit, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It is an extremely intense film that really accompanies you. <br /> <br /> You really have a hard time seeing her. In the theater where I was, most people cried towards the end, even adult men. When you realize what Ben is doing and why, it's a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* Minor SPOILERS ***** That's why it's very hard to talk of that The plot without giving away important things. I feel that knowing too much about this movie really ruins it. However, there was a lot of symbolism in the movie that I enjoyed. I will mention something here (without trying to give much). <br /> <br /> - The fish that Ben was keeping in his hotel room. At first, it does not make any sense at all. There was a LOT of talk in the cinema when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> <br />: I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. In the end, I loved him and I hated him. That's how convincing was Will. I thought Ben was being a big jerk to Ezra, a blind man who was trying to make his way in the world. The reason he treated Ezra that way also became clear enough later in the film. Wait, however, outside. Everything in this movie: wait for it. <br /> <br /> -Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that will not be forgiven. I still do not know if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to get rid of his own guilt, or if he really wanted to help people. I think it's a bit of both ... I think I wanted to help people but also get rid of their past. I love your character. You love him and you hate him because you realize that what he is doing is incredible. You hate him for what he is doing to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Good job Will.
