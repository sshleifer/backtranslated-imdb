['I was curious to know how the critics responded to this moving and inspiring film, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was horrified to discover that the pompous peanut gallery that is our nation&#39;s film critic had given the movie an average of 43 % (or &quot;Rotten&quot;) rating. <br /><br /> All I can say is that if this movie does not move you, you do not have a heart. (It is interesting to note that the same movie on the same website scored 74% of the viewers). <br /><br /> It is not that the opinion of the critics is so important to me. After all, I can not think of a profession more useless and overpaid. Some students are paid to go to the movies (which is a hard life) and do the same as everyone else on the planet: an opinion is formed. But these fools have a way of expressing themselves as if their opinion was somehow more important than yours, and what&#39;s worse, they love to hate. <br /><br /> I grant you that this movie is outdated (well, except for the f-bombs), syrupy and a little predictable ... after all, you know from the beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr. portrays real life. The hero of the Armada Carl Brashear, will triumph (eventually) in each turn, simply by the way he is: determined and courageous; Will and optimist. <br /><br /> But his performance and that of De Niro (as Billy Sunday, a character composed of several real-life people) are so strong, so inspiring, that he will be standing up and encouraging many of the scenes in the film, especially the climax of the court . You should be a real stick in the mud so as not to be moved by these scenes. Like our nation&#39;s film critics. Michael Rappaport is excellent, as well as a sweet-natured stuttering student who befriends Gooding&#39;s Brashear. If someone has seen &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, this character completely redeems that character. <br /><br /> Anyway, this confirms what I&#39;ve always felt: do not listen to the critics. Watch this movie and get inspired.']
