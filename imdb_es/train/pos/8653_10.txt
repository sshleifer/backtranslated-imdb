I just finished watching "Kalifornia" on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it in July 2001. You might think that with the recent wave of serial killer movies, that "Kalifornia" would be among some of the movies previous Worthy of mention but does not have. Perhaps if this film had been released at some point between 1996 and 1999, it might have been more successful. In my opinion, "Kalifornia" is very different from most of the serial killer movies that were released in the late 1990s. It has an atmosphere almost completely different from most serial killer movies like "Seven" or "The Bone Collector." Many movies of serial killers have shown a killer, but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough to really learn something about them. "Kalifornia" is a film that tries to break that barrier and understand the criminal mind. Try to answer questions like "why do they do what they do, is it because of something that happened in the past, does it make them feel superior or powerful? Or do they do it because they like the thrill of killing?" "These are some of the things that" Kalifornia "tries to answer, but it also leaves room for us to try to resolve things for ourselves Brad Pitt makes an eternal impression as Early Grayce When we meet for the first time At the beginning of the film , we see that it is obviously a disturbed individual.When we see it for the first time, it is late at night.Early it is possibly drunk.Then we see it pick up a rock, throw it from a bridge, and then land on the windshield of a passing car Pitt is fierce in this movie, it's always good to see him when he plays with psychopaths or really bad people, it's funny that this would take him later to play a real rascal like in "12 Monkeys" and that he would be at the other end of the spectrum in "Seven" by David Fincher.
