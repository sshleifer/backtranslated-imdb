For those who commented that The Patriot was accurate, (which basically demonized English), it was interesting to watch this movie. Anyway, this was the bloodiest war in which the Americans have been involved, and they were the only nationality present. Therefore, it was very refreshing to see something similar to the historical precision coming from that side of the Atlantic that did not paint the United States as martyrs or saviors. In short, what this film brought home were the true horrors of any conflict, and how the acts committed in the war only generate worse acts, which often culminate in the suffering of the innocent. This was not a movie in which you encouraged anyone, but both felt sorry for and abhorred everyone.
