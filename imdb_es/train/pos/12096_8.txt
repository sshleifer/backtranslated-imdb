['I have seen this movie several times and it has seemed very good to me. This movie is also known as &quot;Castle Of Terror&quot;, &quot;Coffin Of Terror&quot; and &quot;Dance Macabre&quot;. Barbara Steele, is your usual beautiful / spooky. George Riviere, the male leader, does a good job with his role. The whole movie is impregnated with atmosphere, and there is a lot of tension throughout. The angles of the camera are good and the performance, for the most part, is not bad. This movie is very suitable for a rainy day or at night. I have the uncut DVD version, which is far superior to the edited TV version. Take some popcorn, turn off the lights, relax and enjoy. John R.
