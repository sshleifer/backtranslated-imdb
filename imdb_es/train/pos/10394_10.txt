A magical journey invented by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS of British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a masterpiece of the film! Some of the most dazzling early Technicolor, a SUBLIME and Miklos Rozsa's brilliant musical score, along with the youthful exuberance of Sabu, the theatrical and malevolent villany of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess, work beautifully Miles Malleson, who plays Duprez's father, the sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect script that is appropriately great. DO NOT MISS THIS! Since I published the previous comments, I obtained the recently released DVD and I can honestly say that I had never seen the image correctly until I saw this DVD. The clarity and resolution are so precise and the colors are so vivid that I was surprised. An incredible classic can be seen once again and never fails to enchant and delight the viewer. Once again, we must see!
