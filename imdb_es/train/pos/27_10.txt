"The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972), by Emilio Miraglio, is almost the most perfect example of a giallo I have ever seen, mixing all the necessary elements in a sinister stew. First of all, and of utmost importance to me, it has a complex and twisted plot that, in the end, makes a lot of sense, and the killer here does not completely leave the left field at the end. The story, related to a series of gruesome murders (you know how many of the title of the movie, right?) That takes place in the apparent fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, is an implication, and the murderer, a cloak red The figure with the insane laughter of a madwoman is both terrifying and memorable. Every great giallo requires some beautiful main actresses, and here we have a great variety, headed by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of her previous roles, Sybil Danning, as a lustful bum in the fashion house of Barbara. Another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy and humble score, and Bruno Nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days. A beautiful landscape? Check again. Filmed largely in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, the image is truly a pleasure to behold. Okay, fine, but what about those murders? After all, is not that what gialli is about? Well, I'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knives, shots, impalements and other killings that this film delivers with good taste ... not to mention the crypts, the strange sequence of dreams, rats and bats (and MANY of them, too!), References to drugs, the scene of a rape, the obligatory false tracks and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, a man of first rank for the spectators. As I said, a perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD is from the best people in No Shame, and you know what that means: a beautiful print and a lot of extras, to boot! Thanks guys!
