I really enjoyed watching this movie. Like most people who saw it. I was not sure I was getting Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and has made many funny movies; that is, the act of the sister. <br /> <br /> However, this was not really a comedy. It's a drama with funny moments. So if you're looking for a riot of laughter, keep looking. <br /> <br /> This film is about a black family moving from a nice neighborhood in the city to a neighborhood of upper middle class. I would say more but I think it would ruin the movie. this film is not only about racial relations between whites and blacks, but also about relations with the black community. I think it's worth an opportunity. If you're not really interested in watching another movie about race relations, then this movie is not for you.
