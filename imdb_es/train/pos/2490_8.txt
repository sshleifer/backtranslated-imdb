Those from the horror movie "Instant Gratification" will no doubt complain about the pace of this movie and the lack of free effects and body count. The fact is that "The Empty Acre" is a good example of how independent horror films should be made. <br /> <br /> If you avoid independent shelves because you are tired of bothering teenagers or twentysomethings. Some villain whose background story might have come from the back of a box from Count Chocula, "The Empty Acre" is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Located in the decomposing remains of the rural American dream, "The Empty Acre" is the story of a young couple fighting for the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. As the couple's weak relationship crumbles, a larger story develops in the background. At night, a shapeless dark mass springs from arid land in the sun on his farm and apparently devours anything in its path, leaving no trace that he was ever there. <br /> <br /> The film is full of enigmatic characters and visual clues about what is happening, and ends with a well-executed ending that resonates with enough leftover questions to validate the writer / director's faith in an intellectual audience. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a sub-scene Text about the death of the American dream, but it would hardly call the movie an allegory. Nailed, well acted and technically astute, "The Empty Acre" is a fantastic little indie that terror fans should love.
