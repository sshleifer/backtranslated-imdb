I entered this movie without knowing anything about it, and ended up really enjoying myself. Lacked authenticity and credibility: some of the things that the characters said and did were completely strange, and much of the script seemed to be improvised (maybe this is typical of Woody Allen? Excuse my ignorance) but the whole audience In the theater He laughed so much. Not even in the jokes of the movie, but in the whole movie itself. The performance reminded me of Seinfeld's performance, where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes, they are cheesy, but if you do not take the movie too seriously, you can really appreciate the ACTORS 'humor, not the CHARACTERS. If you are looking for a random movie, and you like Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
