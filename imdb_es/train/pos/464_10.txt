I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves, then became even more fascinated by her range and ability in Hilary and Jackie. Now comes this impressive portrait of a rich girl who disdains breeding and convention in favor of raising the tortured soul of the child of a man who clearly needs to be a mother. His eyes are the mirror of his soul, and the soft and beautiful eyes that they are. <br /> <br /> Those who take things literally will find that the poetic and allegorical direction of Marleen Gorris is quite frustrating. The romantics who are willing to go with the incredible kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem that will be well rewarded.
