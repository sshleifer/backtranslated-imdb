Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man, another film similar to a black that is among the rubble of post-war Europe. As TTM, there is a lot of inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who gets emotionally involved with a woman who does not really understand, and whose ingenuity is more surprising in contrast to the natives. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that The third man has a rather elaborate story. Zentropa is a bit disconnected in this regard. Perhaps this is intentional: it presents itself as a dream / nightmare, and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is relentlessly grim - "noir" in more ways than one; one never sees the sun shine sinister, but intriguing and terrifying.
