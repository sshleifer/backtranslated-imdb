Absolutely brilliant Powerful and evocative. The most convincing documentary series ever made about the war. His tone offers a stark contrast to the often arrogant attitude toward World War II exhibited by the media. Instead of choosing to shout about the horror of war, let the quiet voice of Sir Laurence Olivier take a back seat to the real images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, shattered men, politicians indifferent, errors that cost thousands of people. Of the lives, the suffering of the innocent. The most important thing is that humanity is capable of doing it when all the normal rules of "civics" are eliminated. There is something clearly Hobbesian about man in a true state of nature, which will return to a more bestial form capable of crimes that will still impact and fascinate 60 years later. Maybe there could be a follow-up series called "The century in war", since the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors. I feel that it is an irony of immense magnitude that an event that caused the death of 50 million people has been taken to produce such compelling and excellent series as this one.
