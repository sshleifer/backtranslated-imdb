I totally disagree. I thought this was a great movie for children. The mature wells of Gilligans Island, and the promise shown of a dish of dana that was barely known at that time, was very similar to Disney's and, therefore, can hardly be ignored as a meaningless fuzz. It was not so. I did not scare and it was not meant to be. I will not ruin the end. But the way it was done was unusual. I mean, the children's characters were great and I did not know what to expect at the end. The basics. The plot also had much more to do with these children than you say, since the fact that these children were expert fishermen is very important to the plot, especially at the beginning. It also helps them get out of a traffic jam towards the end. It also has the advantage of not being too long. I think it registers in less than 95 minutes
