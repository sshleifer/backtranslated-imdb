A film about wannabee's, never-were's and less-than-heroes doing it against all odds. Where have we heard that before? But when the unfortunate ones are Shoveller, Blue Raja and Mr. Furious, you know that this is not your conventional Rags to Riches story. <br /> <br /> A classic presentation of Eddie Izzard as Tony P. one of the guys from the Disco. The leaders and Geoffrey Rush, like Arch Villain, show that real thought went into casting. <br /> <br /> Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance, a strange choice for the role of Captain Amazing turns out to be the perfect place. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're sick of the comic gone. Cinematographic stereotypes. Why can not anger be a super power?
