"The Last Wave" is one of those films that is based largely on the mind. The title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory: there will be a last wave that will end everything. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer hired to defend some aborigines accused of murder. Around this time, there have been unusually heavy rains in Australia. While defending the aborigines, David learns the theory of the last wave and begins to wonder if it is only mythology. <br /> <br /> The last sequence of the film is a metaphor for descending into the depths of the mind. Peter Weir created a puzzling but exhilarating film. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (whom he may have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") offers an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants. <br /> <br /> If you get an opportunity, look at the "making of" feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the nuances of the film, some of which are related to the background of Richard Chamberlain.
