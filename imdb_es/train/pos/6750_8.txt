This is a very well done film, meticulously directed and with an excellent character that sometimes deeply moves, for example, the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated policeman and his wife. The plot is convincingly elaborate and exciting. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the hero's life. It is clear that the police are as rude and clever as the characters of the underworld. <br /> <br /> A couple of slight reservations: I found the ending slightly one-sided, as it celebrates the successful integration of the hero into the structure of the police and the justice system, which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters that They have maintained until that moment. I also found the main female character somewhat weak: little more than a catalyst for the hero's salvation, all he seems to do is cry and faint while the tough guys fight.
