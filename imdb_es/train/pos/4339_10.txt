['This is one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in my life. I feel very moved by the theme that the film aims to convey. A phrase that comes to my mind is that &quot;history repeats itself&quot;. Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they seem not to understand their parents, their own spouses; people have all the excuses not to share the most loved time with their children until it is too late; people always have to work hard to support the whole family, but they are only able to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners; People always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; People can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved; nothing is more important than the blood relationship that people share in this world, and it is never too late to talk with your friends about what they feel in the bottom of their hearts to achieve a better understanding among themselves, so that when life is to end a day, people should not feel pity or regret as they have kept their words and there is always hope: a new life. The actors and actresses are fantastic. They have perfectly understood the director&#39;s intention. The charm of the film lies, for me, in the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience.']
