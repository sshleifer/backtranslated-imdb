Like many people here, I began to discover that my patience was being tested in this movie. In the end, I actually shed some tears. <br /> <br /> It seems that most old movies have the nature of dragging 7/8 in length and then catching fire right at the end. Those attending the older films learned to patiently wait for their time through the slow, quiet parts knowing that the great reward is on the way. But that is not entirely accurate. For the previous audiences, what are for us the "slow parts" that were the main body of the story? They observed and found anecdotal and thematic interest there. Modern audiences, post-Spielberg, are in a constant state of waiting to be hit with a small climax every two minutes when they watch older films. It's the inflation problem of modern movies. Well, that is not going to happen. It is not necessary to apologize for these films; it is simply that you have to adjust your expectations and your personal rhythm when you look at them. At this point, the difference between Avatar and The Informer is like the difference between Euripides and an itinerant production by Rent. Think about it for a minute or two. It is not necessary to strive for the obvious, but Euripides still deserves an audience. <br /> <br /> The "exciting part", for most modern viewers, starts with the IRA court scene and increases until the last couple of minutes, which, if on board or even paying attention in that moment, it will rip out your heart. It is not a high-pitched universal abstract plea for forgiveness; it is a plea from a fool, and those who feel sorry for the great lummox, for a little mercy. It's so personal, and that disgracefully naked appeal. Because after being angry with Gypo, irritated with him, thinking that this is the dumbest character of all time, you finally find yourself defeated by the scene of Gypo's old girlfriend pleading with another woman to convince her man to Help him <br /> <br /> The movie can be sentimental, but sentimentality is not cheap as some have accused. There is a question of life or death that develops here, and while you take seriously the proposition of a life to a client, sentimentality escapes from the most serious things. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10. And the fault of not being 10 out of 10 is mine and, to some extent, yours, if you're reading this. We have all asked for more, more and more, faster, faster and faster until we can not locate ourselves in 1935, only yesterday, really, as easily as we should be able to.
