"The day is over" is an incredible image. in a way, it is better than "close encounters of the third type". (I prefer independent films with a lot of cheese to the spectacular big budget). The special effects are cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gives an excellent performance in this movie. It's probably one of the best roles I've had in a show. The musical score is very good. The story does NOT make sense. BUT IT ONLY DOES EVERYTHING MORE INTEGRATING. Like many of the best works of art, "the day is over" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "The day it ended" may be a low-budget independent film, but it's not too hard to compare it to the "existential" European films of the 1950s and 1960s. (many of which were independent low-budget productions in themselves).
