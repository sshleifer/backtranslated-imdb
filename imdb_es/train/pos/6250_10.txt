There is something special about the Austrian films not only by Seidl, but also by Spielmann and other directors. This is the penetrating sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the film. Hundstage is not an exception. This effect is achieved not only by the stories represented, but also by the actors who play. In Hundstage I have never had the feeling that these are actors who play, but real people. So real is the visceral feeling of the spectator ... Almost as if the retired grump or the lonely lady of the movie lived below you in your block. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives in Vienna can, without a doubt, painfully recognize the people in the film with their meckern / sudern (complaints), their hidden sexual impulses and the prolo chauvinist boys. This is further reinforced by the Viennese dialect that, according to many, is made especially to complain as a way of life. A special parish and the typical Viennese arrogance are also very well represented. <br /> <br /> The Viennese suburbs have a living presence in the film with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens. In addition, they have become a celebration of materialism with shopping centers and department stores. In the middle are the houses of the people where they give themselves to what they consider pleasure activities, trying to keep in touch with their human being, but in vain. Examples are the sexual game of the old woman with the men who surrounded the rape, the boy of the prolo losing his nerves and beating his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates his drivers. <br /> <br /> The film has no soundtrack, since it concentrates only on the normality / abnormality of its images. Another typical feature of Seidl (and other Austrian directors) is their demonstration of disturbingly sexual images. These include the spoiling of the old woman by her husband, the sexual scenes in the bathroom, the sexual play of the lady with the two men in her apartment, etc. <br /> <br /> In Hundstage, Seild has portrayed the lives. of people who can eventually be both Viennese and citizens of Paris, New York or Madrid. Spectators should not despise or feel sorry for the Viennese in the film, since they themselves could be victims of the same alienation and human alienation, although in different circumstances. In the end, I think Seidl's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation, Seidl has achieved his goal.
