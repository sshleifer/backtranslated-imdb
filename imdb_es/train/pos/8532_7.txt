Lupine goes to Morocco, in search of a legendary treasure. His only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. It is a different and pleasant place for Lupine, with the desert and that exotic feeling. <br /> <br /> One interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, in general he is in a different place than Lupine. . On the one hand, its classical dynamics are lost, but it is a change of pace. Also, in this way, Lupine can concentrate on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko rules on this. Throughout the entire show, she is seducing Lupine and the audience. Then there's Lara, the damsel of this particular story, and it's quite nice. This one has more nudes than any other anime Lupine, which is a funny distinction. <br /> <br /> There is a very entertaining type of effeminate ninja who is the best villain in this, and naturally he has a great fight with Goemon. , as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata, of course, is also up in arms here, in good shape. <br /> <br /> More or less, this is a smooth trip with Lupine. The plot is average and there are some slow points, but in general, this movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
