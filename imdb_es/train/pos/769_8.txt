Of all the breakdance / hip-hop movies released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 Beat Street movie is without doubt the best. The story follows a DJ, his younger brother of breakdance, a graffiti artist and a promoter of the entertainment world who wants to be an aspirant through a winter in which they try to leave the ghetto using their "street" talent. The acting is not always on par and the characters are not fully extended, but are more than compensated by a realistic dialogue, a plausible story, fantastic dance sequences and a timeless hip-hop soundtrack. Note that this film was filmed in the birthplace of breakdance ("This is not New York, this is the Bronx!"), And features appearances by breakdancing parents, the Rock Steady Crew dance group and the rapper. Afrika Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew provides the best scene of the film when they dominate a dance battle in the 80's premiere breakdancing club, the Roxy. A must for lovers of hip-hop.
