Boris and Bela do well together in this movie, whether they're against each other, or paddling in the same boat. I saw this in 1972 and I bought it from Borders this year. This time watching him with my children, I took note of 2 things: He caught the attention of a child of 3, 4 and 5 years; and I caught some things that I did not have when I first saw it. A very fast story with an unpredictable ending. A must for moviegoers!
