Imagine the situation of Richard, a painter whose true passion is to fly. When we meet him for the first time, he is seen on top of a building in London with his wings made at home. He has torn up his canvases and other works, at the height of his desperation, and designs a flying device for his jump. When he falls into the police protective device, he does not suffer a scratch, but leaves him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service. Richard, whose relationship with Anne apparently ended badly, decides to move to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a barn he plans to use to build his own plane. <br /> <br /> Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly. She is a young woman who has A.L.S. or Lou Gehrig's disease and is confined to a motorized wheelchair. Jane is extremely intelligent, but she has a dark side and a salty vocabulary. She uses a handheld device to talk sometimes, since her speech is not clear. What Jane loves to do is lose her virginity, whatever the cost. Jane and Richard collide when they meet, but a mutual tolerance soon makes them feel comfortable. <br /> <br /> Jane, who watches pornography on her computer, has an idea of ​​finding someone like Richard Gere in "American Gigolo", who for a fee will have sex with her. When Richard takes her to London, they find the right man for the job. Their rate is exorbitant, but they agree. As they have no money, Richard decides to rob a large bank. Unfortunately, things do not go according to plan when Jane realizes that she can not fulfill what she wanted. In the end, Richard takes Jane for a ride on his crudely constructed plane for the thrill of his life, something that brings them closer, since they find an affinity between them. <br /> <br /> Peter Greengrass directed this peculiarity Movie that presents an unusual situation. Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in the dominant films and yet she has such a sweet aura that it's hard not to feel for her and what she's trying to achieve. Mr. Greengrass shows affinity material by Richar Hawkins who wrote for the film. The film is not about being cute or giving an attractive image of a young woman with an incurable disease. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason to watch the movie. She makes a wonderful Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh does not seem very suitable for this type of comedy. Somehow, he has his own problems in the way he plays Richard. Gemma Jones has some good times like Anne, Richard's old love. <br /> <br /> "The Theory of Flight" shows a good director. No doubt Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things.
