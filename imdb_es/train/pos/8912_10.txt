I have read many comments on this site that criticize The Blob for being corny and / or cheesy. The film has been criticized for amateur acting and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience has been in the production of locally produced, low-budget Christian shorts (Valley Forge, PA). Let me tell those critics who are too critical that this movie was never taken so seriously. That fact should be evident from the music of the mismatched theme complete with funny lyrics reproduced in the opening credits. For what it was meant to be, this movie is excellent. I have seen some of the recent attempts at ultra low budget, Blair Witch Project was one of them, which has absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thinking behind its plan. BWP was pure excrement. The Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well programmed and completely entertaining. The scene in which the old man meets the meteorite and pokes the mass contained inside with a stick was excellent and genuinely spooky. The scene in the doctor's office with the stain moving slowly under the blanket on the stretcher while consuming the old man was a masterpiece of cinematic horror. The bottom line is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone out there to take $ 120,000.00, inflated by today's dollar value, and make a movie anywhere as entertaining and as successful as the Blob. It just can not be done. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
