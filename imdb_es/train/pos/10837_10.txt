As an aging rocker, this movie mentions Heep and Quo, my 2 favorite bands in the story, but with the incredible cast (all), and the fantastic story, I love this piece of creative genius. I can not recommend it anymore - and Mick Jones added a lot (leader of Foreigner and lead composer along with the best rock singer - Lou Gramm) - I've seen this great job more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - what a voice - and Jimmy Nail: the talent oozes from all pores, then Astrid ... and Karen ... what more could an old rocker ask for? 10/10 - bright bloody. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
