Here is an innovative television drama; that combines so easily a compelling story, the development of characters, humor, romance and drama in each episode. Here is a program that sings its own melody, whether the audience chooses to follow it or not. How many other shows on television these days change their tone so boldly from season to season? Where most of the other major programs on this site have found a formula that works, it attracts viewers and dollars and has stuck like glue to that formula (Prison Break, 24, and Desperate Housewives come to mind): LOST takes a different route in which, even after reaching that plateau and that winning formula, the team of executive producers is brave enough to completely reinvent the program in order to fulfill its superior goal of telling compelling stories. This is where LOST differs from normal television. This is how it is so challenging of conventional television. And that's why LOST is one of the most avant-garde and innovative creations of modern television. Forget the detractors: LOST is, has been and will always be there to appease your cult first and the general public below. But it is a testament to his inventiveness that he has earned a fan base that consists of the best of both audiences.
