I think 'Blackadder the Third' is the best in the series. <br /> <br /> Actually, all the episodes are fun, personally I really like the episode with the 'French invasion', but that of the superstitious actors. , in 'MACBETH' is also very funny, the way Rowan keeps playing with them is really the humor (in English) at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Actors: 'Never say that again, always call it Scottish Play; Blackadder: Oh, so, you want me to say the Scottish play? Actors: YES Blackadder: Instead of MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I have most of his work, but I think he made the Blackadder series especially good. <Br /> <br /> I hope that Rowan continues with her great style, but I think we can count on him, because he is already working on a Bean 2 movie, which will be released this year, I can not wait. .. <br /> <br /> I give this third Blackadder a score of 9 out of 10.
