'Rumors' by Friz Freleng is an excellent cartoon by Private Snafu that warns about the spread of rumors that lead to panic during the war. Produced, like all Snafu shorts, which are shown to the military public as entertaining instructional videos, 'Rumors' is extremely imaginative and contains many ideas in its very short life. When Snafu begins a rumor about a bombing, it becomes a final rumor that the United States has lost the war. This is brilliantly illustrated through a long and rubbery nonsense and several strange and fictitious creatures returning to pursue Snafu with increasingly terrible news about the armed forces of their country. The "rumors" are inventive, fast and fun, all of which helps to overshadow the rather laborious message, "do not speak ill of the military." It stands out as one of the best private shorts of Snafu.
