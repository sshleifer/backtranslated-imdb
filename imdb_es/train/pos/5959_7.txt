While this movie will not go down in the annals of a great movie theater, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The film finally makes its debut in a video where it should have debuted in the first place. <br /> <br /> The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for the dinners they have called "The Hungry Bachelors Club". . Jorja Fox plays a woman who works as a substitute to get a down payment for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a mysterious man who loves Cadillac and becomes his lover. Fox offers a discreet and poignant performance, and Nunn has a reliable talent as always. Micheal des Barres is a great success as a superior lawyer. The ensemble molds, made up of familiar faces, work very well together to bring this crazy group of characters to life. This is a good rental and one of the few you can see with the whole family.
