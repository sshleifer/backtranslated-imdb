Footlight Parade is one of the best musical comedy extravaganzas of the 1930s. A nimble script and cast of stars that includes Jimmy Cagney, the charming Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler make this film outperform the rest. Directed and choreographed by the creative genius Busby Berkeley, this film will make you smile from ear to ear from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Busby, of course, is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical with "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "42nd Street" to his credit (as Dance Director). Footlight Parade has hundreds of girls with little clothes, a registered trademark of Berkeley. The elaborate dance numbers were filmed with a single camera and Busby was the first director to shoot the dancers' close-ups. His obsession with well-formed legs and "rear view" shots is amply demonstrated here. The general effect is highly erotic and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, a producer of "prologues" or short musical productions that were held in cinemas to entertain the public before television fans spoke. shown He is surrounded by crooked partners, a corporate spy and a girlfriend looking for gold. Although Cagney had a strong vaudeville background, this was the first film in which he showed his talent for dancing. Joan Blondell is memorable as the secretary in love and in love with Cagney. And Ruby Keeler is adorable, as always. <br /> <br /> The film climaxes with three outstanding production numbers, "Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each of them a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in the Hollywood today, where the so-called "special effects" have replaced creative cinematography. <br /> <br /> Claudia's bottom line: intelligent and erotic, with some of the best music production numbers that have been put on celluloid. A very pleasant era of depression.
