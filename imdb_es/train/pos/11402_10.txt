I saw "An American in Paris" on its first release when I was still in school and I fell in love with it immediately. I saw him again the next day and lost count of how many times I've seen him, both in the movies and on television. He makes fantastic use of some of the best songs and songs of the best popular composer of the 20th century (George Gershwin) and presents the best male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. The support cast of Oscar Levant (as peculiar as always), Georges Guetary (why did not he make more films?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in an unfriendly role) are at the top of their form. The closing ballet, magnificently choreographed for the title music, makes an excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris and the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All of Gershwin's songs are beautifully prepared, but the most memorable ones are "It's Very Clear" (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and "I Got Rhythm" (children from Paris join Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine" ). If you like Paris, watch this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, look at it. But see it!
