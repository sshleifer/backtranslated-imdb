Why Panic never got a good theatrical release is easy to see: he's too smart, and the audience probably had a hard time comparing him to American Beauty in his mid-life crisis poll, and Sopranos and Analyze This in his studio . Of illegal incidents in family life. Although the panic seems to derive from non-original material, the realistic characters of Brommel, along with skillful dialogues and observing direction, make the film a realistic vision of the downfall of a middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy plays Alex as an assassin who works for his father's contract killing business (Sutherland). He leads a double life, with his wife (Ullman) and his son unaware of his true occupation. In his middle age, he feels increasingly disgusted with what he has done throughout his life. Under his calm, the collected facade awakens resentment repressed by the control of his father in his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), he feels faint and decides it is time to leave the family business. <br /> <br /> The fact that writer / director Henry Brommel decided to make the profession that his main character was trying to break up. Far from contract killing is disposable. He could easily have replaced it with any undesirable profession; His characters are so well developed and credible, the scenes are handled so fluently and realistically, and the dialogue is written so insightfully and naturally that the focus falls on the character in Macy's conflict rather than his work as hired murderer. Brommel's script feels like a tragedy of Shakespeare, with a definite theme of fate that extends throughout. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Macy creates a tragic and easily sympathetic character, and delivers another great and melancholy performance, as always. be expected. Donald Sutherland is also effectively aggressive and abusive as his dominant father, and Ullman's dramatic turn as Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. Consider a scene in a bicycle shop, where your mood subtly darkens and reaches its peak in an affective scene of emotional turmoil. <br /> <br /> Henry Brommel's first feature, Panic, is a well-crafted film in its sincerity. With a first class cast, a plausible script, a concise dialogue and a good direction, this study of characters is, with luck, a sign of Brommel's ability to create characters that seem real. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
