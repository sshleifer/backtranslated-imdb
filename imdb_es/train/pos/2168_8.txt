I saw this movie on television a night ago, many years ago, but it was a disturbing experience that has stayed with me to this day. <br /> <br /> The premise may seem a bit unoriginal, due to an earthquake, a hiding place The underground storage of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town is damaged, and a microscopic amount of the substance is found your way in your food supply. City dwellers begin to lose their ability to exercise restraint over every whim and craving that floats in our minds from time to time, and we usually know that we simply must not act. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow, but for me that only added to the disturbing concern, as the behavior of the townspeople begins to slowly unravel. There are several surrealist and very disturbing scenes that have remained etched in my memory all this time. <br /> <br /> It raises interesting questions about what we might all be capable of if we surrendered to our wildest instincts. Enjoy it? I'm not sure that "enjoy" is the right word. It made me think? Insurance. I'm still thinking about it. Scary things.
