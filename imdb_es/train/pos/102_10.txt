The first time I heard about this movie about 20 years ago, when I was a kid in elementary school (!), It happened that I was flipping through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and under the entrance to movies (or movies, not the I remember), there were several still images for different movies from the mainstream to the experimental ones, and one of them shown on the page was a still image for OffOn. It really intrigued me, as it stood out more on the page (it was an image of the scene film with the eye with other elements superimposed on it). <br /> <br /> Approximately 18 years later. , the public library where I live was available to review the complete set of 4 DVDs of "Treasures of American Film Archives", published by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I was reading the notes on the DVD cases for the set, I was pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I finally saw the movie! After watching it, I was not expecting it to be (it tended to be a more organic looking movie, not that it was a bad thing, but I expected it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an awesome movie, IMHO, considering the techniques that Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including the hand-tinting of the film itself, and the use of video equipment for some of the scenes in the film (filmed on a video monitor), which gives it an image more distressed, low resolution aspect. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite innovative for 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short / experimental films, and a creative inspiration for me too ...
