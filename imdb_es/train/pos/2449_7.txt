When I saw commercials for this, I was thinking "NOT WHAT NICK HAS DONE IN NITE!" because I was occupying "fresh prince" slots. Well, I still love the cool prince. But Jorge LÃ³pez is a surprisingly good show. I love how Benny is not stereotyped. Carmen is a good character, it's really fun to see how stupid and exaggerated it can be sometimes. I feel bad for the player who plays max, he looks much younger than he really is. But Max is a funny character, and he acted well. And yes, Angie is a bit stereotyped, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george has a great head! No, but he can also be very good. Fun show Definitely should be more often after home improvements.
