The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here, Mia visits her father for her father's birthday, who occasionally has some kind of tragedy, the question is what will this year be, and he will be surprised ... It is a very well composed film, with A story which has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen. You're happy, they hurt you, and basically everything in between. Finally, you can not help falling in love with Mia (if you're a child, I suppose (the main actress)) She's a very well-chosen actress, like many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
