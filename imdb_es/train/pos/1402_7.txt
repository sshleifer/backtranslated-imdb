Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" is probably the weakest film that Paul Verhoeven, director of great films like "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" has ever done. <br /> <br /> It's probably not your fault. For some reason, Verhoeven was stuck with an absolutely mediocre script, and he did the best he could. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is pretty good, with a lot of cynical jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the film fails in the second part, if it degenerates into a standard Slasher movie or maybe a very bad "Alien" clone. The ending is especially ridiculous, <SPOILER>, since Kevin Bacon keeps coming back to life after a series of incidents that should have killed him (in the logical sense of the word). </ SPOILER>. And everything is quite superficial, in fact: the issue of becoming invisible is never completely investigated. <br /> <br /> But in general, Verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of **** stars
