"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This tremendously entertaining film catches you from the initial scene and never fails to give laughter, surprises and unexpectedly moving moments. I had more fun watching "The Matador" than almost any other film from 2005. It's a rare movie with an unforgettable character, played to perfection by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a hit-man who specializes in high-end corporate concerts (assassins of rich guys). He is also experiencing something akin to a mid-life crisis. After realizing that he has no real friends, does not have a permanent home or a planned future, he stumbles into the bar of a Mexican hotel one night and meets Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Danny is a down down. a family man who is on his luck and is about to lose the big business that could change things for him. He deeply loves his wife, especially because they lost their young son a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The two men are chalk and cheese, almost no common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one. night. And somehow there is a conversation that starts a chain of events that will change their lives forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship they form reminds me a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is the heterosexual man and the other is the persistent fool that gets them in trouble. The game is very well programmed and tuned, due in large part to the wonderful performances of Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake ... This is Brosnan's movie. He prints one of the most memorable and despicably pleasant characters of the decade. He could shoot your mother and apologize immediately afterwards and probably forgive him. Brosnan may be the ultimate charm of cinema, but this is his most appealing and complete performance to date. I would not be reluctant to see a wink from Oscar for this role. <br /> <br /> Consider a scene where he shows himself openly with a high school girl with the most impure thoughts and says the line: "Everything blushes ... It does not suck." He does it with Bond's familiar smile and manages to get away with it. He manages to say to a child, "Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years, then call me again" without appearing unpleasant. In fact, we like him more like him. <br /> <br /> And yet, the film manages to surprise us with some really moving scenes, most of which come to an end when the film takes some unpredictable twists. However, when Julian flips through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console themselves in their room one night, the film reaches an unexpected thrill. <br /> <br /> "El Matador" is elegant and energetic. It is constantly entertaining. And he has a role that defines Brosnan's career as the lonely hit man who seeks normalcy, friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life. This is a jewel missed in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler of IndependentCritics.com
