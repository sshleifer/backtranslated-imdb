The Unborn is a Roger Corman production and, as such, is unpleasant and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, check out this movie because it is full of previous murders and failed abortions. Brooke Adams plays Virginia. She and her husband's group go to an elegant fertilization clinic because they can not have children alone. There they meet Dr. Meyerling (James Karen of ROTLD 1 and 2). Dr. Meyerling has had a very high success rate to get couples pregnant. (Insert the joke here). Is it because he is creating some super mutant, genetically murderous babies? That's what Virginia begins to think when she starts having some strange side effects and extreme mood due to the treatment. That's when she begins to take matters into her own hands. <br /> <br /> In this case, you will have to get the rest of the details in another place, because if I told you all the good things, this could hurt you. yourself placing it in your Netflix rental queue too fast. It's a bit slow for a while, but once it recovers in the last third, all systems are ready! Highly recommended by me for the strengths of their fetal violence without CP. 33 1/2 of seventeen stars.
