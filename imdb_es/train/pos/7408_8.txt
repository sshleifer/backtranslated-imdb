I had the privilege of watching this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a low-budget $ 200,000 movie about a father and his 2 children. The father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local men, mostly elderly, relax and bathe. The father has children: a "retarded" child who lives with him and a son who lives in a large modern city and comes to visit him. For this son, the traditional village, the bathhouse and his "retarded" brother seem strange and annoying, but this changes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Although the story may sound corny or clich√©, it is not. With really cool performances, especially from the father and the "retarded" son (sorry, I do not know their names) and a great story, the film was touching and fun at the same time. <br /> <br /> Yes You have the opportunity to watch this movie do it. It is an excellent alternative to conventional Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br />
