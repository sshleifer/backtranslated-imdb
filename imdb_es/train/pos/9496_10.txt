['What can be said about the movie White Fire? Amazing? Fantastic? Disturbing? Funniest? These words are not big enough to describe the event that is White Fire. From wobbly, confusing beginning to end, this film will entertain everywhere. <br /><br /> Our film starts in the forests of a country somewhere in the world. A family is hiding from the unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. When the father separates from the mother and her children, you have a real idea of what kind of movie you are about to watch. The father makes sure he rolls through the hills in his completely white suit, and is polite when he gets people&#39;s attention before shooting them, but, unfortunately, Dad is burned alive in what seems to be an unguarded, unsure trick. Meanwhile, mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier who crawls about 5 feet behind them. He also gives a stern warning before the action in the form of a strange &quot;HALT!&quot;, And then quickly wastes the mother. This sequence of action establishes the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingred. <br /><br /> So now we advance some 20 years (30 if you&#39;re honest about the age of the hero) to beautiful Turkey, where Bo and Ingred have established themselves as professional thieves, diamond seekers or something like that. Ingred works in a diamond mine where he helps with the goods, while Bo (played brilliantly by the dynamic Robert Ginty) runs through the desert in his denim suits. Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship. It seems that they do not have other friends, and they spend all their time together. That, along with the fact that Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister, as shown in lines like &quot;you know it&#39;s a shame you&#39;re my sister,&quot; tells her that while she&#39;s completely nude, she creates a very dynamic duo . Bo is crushed when they kill Ingrid, as she wanders the beaches of Turkey with her pink scarf of ceremonial pain. A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid and performs plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid. This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without being technically incorrect. Bo is a true fan of the ethical gray areas, and is delighted with his new love. <br /><br /> Anyway, there are many funny action scenes, ridiculous violence, great acting, impossible to follow the lines of the plot, Fred &quot;the hammer&quot; Williamson (for some reason) and a large portion of dirty ice that is supposed to be a giant Diamond (which then explodes). All these things are great, but the relationship between Bo and Ingrid is what makes this film special ... really special. So I sincerely encourage everyone to contemplate the majesty that is the White Fire. You can be glad you did ... or not.']
