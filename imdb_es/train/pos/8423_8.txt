Thats My Bush is first and foremost a very entertaining show by Parker and Stone, I thought. It is often very funny, and it is quite subversive and crazy. South Park fans would surely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the production value here. You must have put a lot of money into this, and it shows. A lot of small, expensive details. It is not a small show. And Comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel, but obviously they put a lot into this program. In a way, I understand that it was also the death of the show, too expensive. Surely it could have been made cheaper and the will followed was there. <br /> <br /> The critics liked it, and it had its small fan base, but it did not win a large audience. As we know, the program stopped after 8 episodes, which I guess is almost a season. <br /> <br /> As I really liked the show, it has its flaws. The problem with the show is that he does not know what he really wants to be. It's like trying to be a comedy and a parody of a comedy at the same time. The actors do a good job, and some of them are well fused, but in my opinion, it seems that they do not always get 100% of the weird humor they're supposed to present. <br /> <br /> Personally I think the program needed some characters that were simpler for the program to work. In South Park you have Kyle and Stan, who are a kind of realistic touch in the craziest universe. I think that's what makes South Park work. You need some healthy characters with whom you can relate in a realistic way, and that makes unhealthy things much more interesting because they force you to take them seriously at some level. If everything is archetypes and stereotypes, it is difficult to be emotionally included in the program, which is really Thats My Bush's biggest problem. Kyle and Stan are characters in South Park that give meaning to the madness in the show. We do not have any of that here, and this show suffers. <br /> <br /> Another anchoring point is Parker and Stones flirting with Republicans. It's the only thing about them that I really do not understand what they're trying to do. Do not portray Bush as nothing more than a fool Homer Simpsons, kind of kind character IS a bit subversive in a world where many people can not stand it and believes he is the worst president since Nixon, and a parallel comedy of the world of Letterman and so it just satirizes all his movements ... but it's hard to understand if Parker and Stone really mean anything with that. It's as if the joke was on us, but somehow it does not reach the mark. It seems awkward, because it does not remind you of the real Bush at all. <br /> <br /> Besides that, I really thought that the show was very nice. Some of the jokes here are hilarious. The pro-life supporter who was an aborted surviving fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes of them in any program. And the show is full of excellent material, and sometimes it's incredibly fun if you use your head a little while watching it.
