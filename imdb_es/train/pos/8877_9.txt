This story was probably one of the most powerful I have ever assimilated. John Singleton certainly did his best to put together this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances by the entire cast, but Epps and Rapaport got the best and most convincing race of either of the two stars. <br /> <br /> However, as a university student myself, many of the topics that Singleton addressed were taken to the extreme. In a sense, while they are problems that are faced on many college campuses, they do not present themselves as big or as openly as this movie would. In some cases, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could really happen. However, aside from the fact that it was a bit more dramatic, the film was brilliant and it left me stunned, unable to speak, just think. One of the things in this image that I will remember forever, was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's character, "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see your power". Bright, simply bright.
