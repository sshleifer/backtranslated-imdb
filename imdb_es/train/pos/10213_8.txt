This capricious film had the misfortune of being released at the same time as the very popular "Amelie", and both had the wonderful Audrey Tautou in the central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director, made one of the most enjoyable films that have left France in recent memory. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the opportunity, as indicated by its English title. The French title refers to the way that the wings of butterflies can create chaos on the Atlantic while flying, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something that can not be believed simply by observing these colorful insects. From the beginning, the director intertwines all the characters that one sees in the film and how each one has a connection with the other, something that is hard to imagine, but in the context of the film it seems to work well. <br /> <br /> A casual encounter in the subway marks the tone of the film. Irene, who goes to work, the woman who is sitting in front of her asks her to tell him what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read it in her newspaper. Irene, it seems that you will cross paths and find your soul mate that same day. After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man who is sitting next to the woman tells him that she has the same date of birth as Irene. It seems that they are destined to each other from the beginning, but, unfortunately, they will not be reconnected until the last frame of the movie. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have much to do until the end, but he shows that he has a presence and plays his role well. The young and talented cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as the butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We look forward to future Laurent Firode films because he seems to be a director with his heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected.
