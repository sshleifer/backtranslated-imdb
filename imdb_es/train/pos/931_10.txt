['I enjoy all versions of this story, but this is my favorite of all times. George C.Scott gives depth to the Scrooge character that the others do not give. The movie shows more about why it becomes so bitter. The changes in Scrooge appear gradually as you encounter the different ghosts and the incidents they show you. <br /><br /> This movie has the best Tiny Tim by far. He is the right age instead of being played by someone who is almost a teenager like in the other movies. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his baby teeth. <br /><br /> David Warner is wonderful as Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He plays the role with dignity, neither as a weak man cowering under the grave of Scrooges, but as a man who endures it with grace because he has a family to provide. Susannah York and the other actors do a good job to bring the characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Ghost of the Christmas gift I&#39;ve seen. Most of the time he plays as a cheerful Santa type character. In this, he shows anger at the attitudes of Scrooges and really makes Scrooge reconsider. <br /><br /> The costumes and sets really make Dickens&#39;s London come true. A wonderful movie']
