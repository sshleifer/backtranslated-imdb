by saying that, I want to say that this is not a well made movie, but it is a very good version of the real event and the best description so far. And if you are a World War II fan, this is a delight for you, because there are three of the four members of the saboteur who play roles in this film. In the best of cases it is a theater, but this is still what is said before a semi documentary. <br /> <br /> I personally am a big fan of our almost superhuman heroes of the Second World War, and there should be hundreds of these movies that show us what they did so that the next generations will not forget them. Because nowadays children do not read books, they watch movies. <br /> <br /> So, if you want an action show, rent Private Ryan, this is the truth about the persistent pain, the outrageous resistance and the will to fight when everything seems lost.
