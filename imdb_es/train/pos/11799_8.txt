A well-fused summary of a real event! Well, actually, it was not there, but I think that's how it could have been. I think there are two typically American points of view evident in the film: 'communistophobia' and parallels to Adolf Hitler. This should be evident to most independent observers. Anyway, Boothe makes a great performance, like many other well-known actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie are unbearable, and I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so terrible, everything happened, and it probably looked that way). But, really, did the last scene at the air station actually take place?
