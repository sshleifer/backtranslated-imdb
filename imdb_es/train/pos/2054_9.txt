When I first heard about the title, I thought about 'The Simpsons', like many other critics, but when I saw the cast, I was completely amazed, that so many actors of great characters were really in this! First, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), who plays the main character, McBain. He is rescued from a prisoner of war camp in Vietnam by some of his friends, one of whom is Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), who divides a FIVE DOLLAR ACCOUNTS with McBain (Vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash at seem), and tells him that he can do him the favor again if he ever gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (María Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) join the rebels. in Colombia, trying to get rid of his evil dictator, the President (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York), and when Santos fails in the mission, Christina goes to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain then asks his good friends in Vietnam to help him. First is the tough black man, Eastland, played by Steve James of "American Ninja," who was also in the previous film by director James Glickenhaus, "The Exterminator," where the real name of the exterminator was also Eastland, coincidence? I do not think so. There are also many other references to The Exterminator, among others, the most notable is that McBain himself wears a welder mask when Christina sees it for the first time, when he is working on a welding job on the top of a bridge. /> <br /> The other guys in the Vietnam package are: the rich guy who can afford all kinds of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and then there's the doc. , Dalton, (played by Jay Patterson, who does not look like the guy that the IMDb is linked to, and I have not seen him in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, the police, Gill , who has already had enough of his unsatisfactory work, has been interpreted by Thomas G. Waites, which some of us remember of The Warriors and the Thing. <br /> <br /> And in other important roles, we find Luis Guzmán (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way), as a drug dealer who can not get a decent job. In addition, there is Dick Boccelli as the drug lord who hangs himself on a crane on top of a roof by McBain's gang, almost exactly the same way he hung himself in a meat-grinding machine by John Eastland in the EXTERMINATOR-FILM! Now, I still have not seen "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop" by Glickenhaus, but I'm almost ready to bet on a half dollar bill that Boccelli also hangs in that movie! <br /> <br /> Well, going back to the plot of this movie ... they go to Colombia and save the day, yes! But who cares about the plot anyway, the cast is great, and the action scenes are very well done, and you never get bored while watching this movie! Highly recommended for all action lovers!
