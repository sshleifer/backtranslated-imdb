I saw this movie when Mystery Science Theater published it in 1993. It's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. So bad, in fact, that out of sheer rarity, this movie must get a rating of ten because it must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten. I mean, really, the devil against Santa? Visions of hell? A spooky, laughing reindeer? Forced child labor with racial stereotypes? That's not Sesame Street, that's for sure. As Cuervo exclaims during the MST3K he shows: "This is a fashionable nightmare fuel!" <br /> <br /> There are a lot of weird innuendos and ruined theology. Merlin (probably Arturo Merl√∫) meets Santa Claus in his crazy castle in the clouds (ie, Heaven). Santa Claus talks about the baby Jesus and sends letters to "Mr. Stork" for children who ask for siblings. There are symbols around the castle that look like pentagrams or stars of the RAF. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have seen it every year since 1993 and we are forcing anyone we can keep pressed for 2 hours to be seen with us.
