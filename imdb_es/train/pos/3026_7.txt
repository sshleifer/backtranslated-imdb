Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and has come to London to buy coal in "Confidential Agent," a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is willing to stop him, except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he is accused of murder, but he is determined to get coal for his people so they can fight against the fascists. <br /> <br /> This movie has its good points and others not so good. It's high for atmosphere and suspense, and it's very entertaining. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is stingy, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix is ​​appropriately pathetic and Seymour is incredibly wonderful. <br /> <br /> The not so good points: Bacall is supposed to be English and Boyer in Spanish. UH no. Boyer is excellent in his role, even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not the British upper class. The two do not have chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is something miscast. His performance is not up to it either; She is better in other movies. But she is an amazing looking woman, and she can forgive herself a lot. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost exaggerated and hateful. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a guest at the hotel that studies human nature. It is a big part and its performance is perfect, while part of the direction of the other actors is not so good. This was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.
