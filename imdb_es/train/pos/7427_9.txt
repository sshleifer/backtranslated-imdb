I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70s when I was just 16 years old while watching another movie. Oh! How excited I and my best friend were. We could not wait more or less a month until it went on. I saw this movie 17 times that year in the theater. I love love I love it. Kris is so perfect for the movie. He's shameless and a bit silly, but also shy and insecure with Babs, and it's so endearing to see him again. When they sing evergreen in the studio and he intervenes with his husky voice very different from the perfect notes that come from her, but I always thought that this was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at her and is so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like this-she even had the long sweater and the cap that was like the one she was wearing. This arrived on television in time and I got my daughters to see it, they were teenagers and they loved it. Maybe it's just that I was so caught up in a time when everything was extreme, I do not know. The end always has me crying until today.
