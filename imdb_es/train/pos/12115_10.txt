Another comment about this movie made it sound lousy. Considering that the spoken images were so new, I think the script and the acting were good Davis was so young and fresh. I still had not found the style we expected. However, it is great to see her in this way, even learning the trade. <br /> <br /> So many clich√©s emerged from this movie and it seems that this movie opened some paths for the next 70 years. My vote is to see it and remember how young this kind of movie was. Keep an open mind and it may surprise you how worried the characters were in this image, for being 1934 and how we consider the first part of the last century to be tense. I love it and I hope you make a decision about it without influence. For other negative comments and a note.
