The only notable thing about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first major role. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is not developed and he's raw but refreshingly honest in this little work of science fiction horror. Steve shows himself as the anti-establishment actor and lover of hot rod cars that would become a polished icon of the film industry in just five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen would say that he hated this movie and that "he was the blob". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. I wish we had stayed that way. <br /> <br /> The plot is fast-paced and, although predictable, it's still an entertaining hour. And it's very funny to see Steve McQueen before he became The King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before she became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD a while ago and it is a treasured addition to my Steve McQueen movie collection.
