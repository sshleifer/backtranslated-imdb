['This is a very strange movie by director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows William&#39;s work knows that he is a little out of place (if he is not witty), but he takes the cake. <br /><br /> It has two unfortunate ragdolls who have to save the new French doll of its owner from a lustful pirate toy and are at the mercy of several strange characters on the way. The strength in this film lies mainly in its aesthetic quality; its strange designs of characters, its powerful animation and its stark contrast between the sweet and the terrifying. Williams&#39; brilliant animation represented Raggedy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls, rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls, which made it more believable (at least in a visual sense). The animation shines as we bring the Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-Knees, whose body walks with two different personalities that control each end, the search for silent movies with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, the greedy one. <br /><br /> The greedy animation, in itself, is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation I&#39;ve seen in my life. There is something in this animation that simply makes you gape, and every second is something new. Living in what was considered &quot;the well of Taffy&quot;, the Greedy is an immense man who lives and eats without mercy. He sings a song that I can not help but feel some sexual nuances, then he tries to kill Raggedy Ann for his sweet heart. <br /><br /> The only complaint I have about this movie is that there are too many songs. The rhythm of the film is continually stuck because there are sixteen of them. There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones) that include &quot;I Look, And What Do I?&quot;, &quot;No Girl&#39;s Toy&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot; (although they did not have to sing it twice). ), &quot;I never have enough&quot;, &quot;Because I love you&quot; and maybe &quot;I&#39;m at home&quot;. The others simply seem unnecessary and, frankly, they are not too surprising to hear them. <br /><br /> This is a rare movie with strange nuances, but if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, you will not find anything better.']
