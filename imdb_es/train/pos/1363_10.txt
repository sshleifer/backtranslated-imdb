A great movie of the 90! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires a lot of money. Posey gives an incredible performance as librarian and night tracker. This is a good light movie for Saturday night before leaving. The soundtrack is amazing, the outfit is out of this world, the script is fun and the actors do a great job. The redeeming value: you can do it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I think Parker Posey is the PERFECT actress for this type of character: young, fabulous and broken. (You must find the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you see Party Girl, you are bound to have a good time. Enjoy!
