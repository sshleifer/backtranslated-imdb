ZP is deeply related to that youthful dream represented by the hippie movement. The debate in the university at the beginning of the film establishes the cultural situation that gives origin to that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines represents the fall of all social structures and, therefore, the development of all the enormous transformation that society is undergoing and, finally, the death of Mark anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself . The movie will be easier to understand if we go back to that moment in life. During the 60s and 70s, young people were the engine of deep explorations for change. One of the most significant changes that was intended was to get the sexuality out of the closet, and I think that the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy, but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would make in the hypothetical situation where there would be nobody to whom hide. I observed the scene in which couples threw sand and appreciated the magnificent way in which A showed the impossibility of continuing to hide this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to "control" social outbursts at that time and that is the method applied by the police to arrest students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, and that becomes clear when students gain access to weapons that bypass all false controls. The dialogue between the police and the university professor, who is being detained without any reason, shows part of the society interested in this youthful feeling and another part completely disinterested. Presenting the flight as the most accurate symbol for freedom, the theft of the plane represents Mark's inner desire for it, but his (going back or returning or returning (according to)) shows the difficulties in getting rid of these ties and as I said , A represents the death of the dream by these difficulties to win the game. In my point of view a movie to remember.
