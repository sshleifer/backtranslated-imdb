Some movies seem to be done before we are ready for them. While watching this movie, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was watching O.J. The Simpson debacle (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation). <br /> <br /> The Australian media, if this movie is to be believed, devoured the case of possible infanticide and the truth. It was left as a late occurrence. It was frightening to see the scenes of invaders, swarms of media hordes, ridiculous stories of half-truths and lies and debates about the supposed merits of the case by people at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> Equally atrocious is The description of the media as indifferent and incomprehensive of the technical information of the case. I would like to hear more about the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the defendants are seven days Adventists). <br /> <br /> Today these circuses have become common, but that makes the lesson more important. <Br /> <br /> Streep is excellent as always, and this is the best I've seen Sam Neill. Australian accents get a little thick at times but they are not incomprehensible.
