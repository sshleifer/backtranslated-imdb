This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly about the need to make movies. In general, I am a fan of movies based on true worthy stories. And this is great! In addition to the performance of Meryl, who has won much recognition and praise, the film's greatest asset is the story on which it is based. The fascinating story of a couple who suffers social and legal torture, after having suffered enormous emotional pain from the unexpected and brutal death of their baby, is really a revealing fable that exposes the inhuman side of other human beings and discovers the barbarism of A very refined and legal society. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves to be kind and intelligent (the emotional jury ladies in the movie, for example) are really nothing more than selfish imitations who, because of their beliefs and dogmatic prejudices, close their brains to any deliberation. and contemplation even in light of all the facts that point very clearly against their opinions. The other side of the so-called "civilized" society that the film exposes is apathy for the pain of other human beings (it goes without saying that this is very general, although this specific story takes place in Australia), which goes so far . How to become a true cruelty. You should see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps stimulating.
