I instantly fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show manages to put a smile on my face with a great narrative, an ingenious dialogue and a great performance. But that's not all: it also manages to keep you until the end. The basic idea behind the show: bringing people back to life with a single touch, ending the undead state with a second, is interesting and could still be in later seasons. But the cases of suspense murders, the unique aspect of the program and the highly competent narrator add to the experience. But "Pushing daisies" is more than parts. I have a certain charm that I really enjoy and I'm looking forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season.
