The story is about Ankush (Abhay Deol), who is a professional witness of marriage; In short, he acts as a witness for couples in the marriage registration office, and Megha (Soha Ali Khan) who fled his home in Nainital to marry her. Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins with Megha waiting in the marriage registration office for Dhiraj to show up, but for some reason he does not show up. So Ankush appears in the image here, who had approached Megha with the intention of obtaining Rs. 200 for his Witness work and he ends up helping her by providing shelter. Ankush grows from his side working in a bank as an agent ... Ankush falls in love with Megha and she also falls in love with him (or a kind of love), both agree with the marriage and Dhiraj returns to the scene. Unexpected circumstances happen, really I should say, expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then ... <br /> <br /> Actually, the story of the film is a little different from the movies we see and I do not think That is accepted by the But if you are a fan of movies like me and you love to see something different, you will definitely like the movie. The film is just an innocent love story written very well by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you feel like things are happening to the guy next door. The background music of the film also plays a very good role, it's too good. The way Delhi is displayed is very good and gives a fresh feeling. <br /> <br /> so let's cut and summarize. <br /> <br /> History: A very common story that gets along very well and transformed into a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, as was the creation of Himesh Reshammiya, I did not expect much, but I still liked some of the songs in the film, including Qawwali. <br /> <Br /> Acting: Abhay Deol was the most impressive actor, very natural and innocent, but he must avoid singing in the songs. Soha Ali Khan, she is a doll, a very pretty doll, I must say. Again a very innocent and natural performance and these two actors fit perfectly into their characters. Apart from these two, Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and there may be few layers of fat to cover the bones. Other actors did their job well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I would also give it 3.5 stars out of 5. You will enjoy the movie if you saw it in the theater, I would recommend that you see it in the theater if you are a Freak of the film and accept uncommon stories. Otherwise, wait for the DVD to arrive. The film will definitely not be to the liking of the masses and the business it can do is word of mouth advertising.
