Oh, sixty. There were some interesting movies. I was more of a movie fan then. Now I enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my house instead of going to the theater. I also saw this short film, "The legend of the boy and the eagle". I've been looking for this movie for years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I was finally able to gather more information from your site. Thanks ........ I'm surprised to discover that this short film was an opening for a Disney movie. I did not remember the Disney movie either. I did not even remember it was a premiere movie for Disney. I really wish they would show this on television at some point. I wonder if Disey has the rights to this movie. Is it available on DVD? This is a must see for all generations!
