I must say that this movie for television was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. Now we are very used to seeing it in a comedy and I really hope that a television station will show this movie for television soon, since it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama. Seen as we have seen it in Sabrina for 5 years, and giving viewers an idea of ​​their great unused talent would be an advantage. Melissa plays her role so well in this fact of wanting her parents "to be eliminated" so she can be with the boy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina's viewers will notice, Melissa works with David Lascher on this, long before he took on the role of Josh in Sabrina. Therefore, it would be good to see this now every time it is issued again. Hopefully, MJH gets some good roles in movies or even more TV movies, something like Kellie Martin, who has always shone in television movies. A lot of unused talent waiting to leave when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, always shine Melissa !!!
