This movie was amazing. It is an inspiring piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed through the truth in which the Director, Lucy Walker contributes to the film. I recommend it to anyone looking for that special movie that shows humanity in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker shows the beauty of the landscape. This film is a true example of man against nature and, sometimes, man against man. Internal confusion and triumph are tremendous in their matter. The subject of how the Tiebtans see blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been exhibited. Lucy Walker has given Erik Weihenmayer a voice when they normally would not have listened to him. Thank you, Lucy, for being true to your vision as a filmmaker.
