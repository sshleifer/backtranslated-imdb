If I watch a movie and do not look at my watch once to see how long it will be working or when I hope the last scene is not the end of the movie, it has to be pretty good. I am not a film internalist or a film dissector. I watch movies and if they keep me interested until the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed movies took me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash.) This movie kept me interested and absorbed From beginning to end, the acting is great, the story is absolutely original, the flash-back technique is very emotional, there was a bit of citizen Kane when Hoffman destroys his apartment after Tomei abandons him, but I forgive him, because I see him as a Tribute to Orson, instead of a scam.
