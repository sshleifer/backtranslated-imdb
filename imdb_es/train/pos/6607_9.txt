I would almost give it 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts, as well as sections that fail in the direction, which harms the flow / continuity of the film. The story line is large and well composed; You will definitely want to see this in silence to fully understand it. The characters are complicated and so is the storyline: expect to be given just enough information to stop scratching your head, it's a movie where everything is explained at the end. The animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir results in a great movie that does not look like anything I've seen in the animation. It is a film in black and white and its darkness is quiet in some scenes, so it is worth seeing in a good TV or plasma. The voices of the characters keep this film in its English version, but it would have been more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize what is happening in Paris, I enjoyed it more in French with English subtitles. Everything is worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if you have it! And personally if you liked this movie you may like it too; Waking Life & Ghost in to Shell 2 Innocence, this is just a personal suggestion.
