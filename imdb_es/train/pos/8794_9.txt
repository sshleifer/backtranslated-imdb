The "Shaolin Temple" by Chang Cheh could very well be the highest brand of the martial arts film series Shaw Brothers. This moving kung fu epic features an amazing cast, a true who's who of the Shaw stable. Although the plot is fairly standard and the choreography of the fight is excellent as usual, the handling of the theme by Cheh is what makes this film is extraordinary and enjoyable. The sense of reverence shown by the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is palpable in all frames. Not unlike William Keighley's singing to the legendary Fighting 69th in that same titled film or John Ford's greeting to West Point in "The Long Gray Line," Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" is an ode lovingly designed in that same style. <br /> <br /> The cultural correlation that I am tempted to do is to compare the Shaolin Temple with the Alamo. Watching this movie will give the same feelings of admiration and nostalgia that you experienced many years ago in elementary school history when you learned about the courage and sacrifice of those condemned heroes of the Alamo. At the end of the movie, you may also be tempted to shout: Remember the Shaolin Temple!
