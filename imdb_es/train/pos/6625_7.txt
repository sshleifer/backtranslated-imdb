If you've ever seen the trailer for the movie "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you'll never have to watch that movie. Unfortunately, Renaissance has had equally revealing trailer manufacturers. <br /> <br /> The story of Renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher. The stage is a futuristic Paris, and the elements of science fiction appear everywhere. The special thing about the Renaissance, however, is its visual style, and not its history. Renaissance is a computer animation in 3D, like Final Fantasy, but highly stylized in black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. The result looks impressive (although the problems of 3D animation of human beings are still noticed from time to time: slightly robotic movements, wooden facial actions, etc.) As a beautiful and highly stylized cinematographic renaissance, Renaissance manages to surprise the public , especially visually. However, history and writing are not of the same level of quality as images. It's not a bad story (and presumably, if you have not seen the trailer, it's much more exciting than it was for me). But it is a story that is not very original, and is on the edge of the corny. Some lines of dialogue were painfully corny, making writing sound like a beginner's first effort. <br /> <br /> I will definitely recommend Renaissance to my friends. It's different from everything I've seen before, visually, and I think that just because of its originality is a worthwhile experience. It is also a visible story, even if it is not perfect.
