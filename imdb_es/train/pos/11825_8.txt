Do not look for a plot that is too developed here ... just curl up with some popcorn and enjoy this. A gallery of stars appears as the villains of the classic cartoon character in this live-action comedy, which features incredible make-up and set design, not to mention the spectacular performances of Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Great fun for children and adults alike. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
