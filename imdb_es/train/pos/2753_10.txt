My favorite movie of all time! I have seen many movies, but this is better than all! Excellent performance, wonderful story. You, as a "normal" humanitarian person, will begin to love George. Although he is an actor, he is also himself and a very kind person. And the most important thing about maby: you will learn to respect and see people with Down syndrome differently.
