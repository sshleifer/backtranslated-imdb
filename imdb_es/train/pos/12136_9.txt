Shortly before the imposition of a code of morality obscured the mood of writers, directors and actors, the first film adaptation of "Of Human Bondage" by W. Somerset Maugham entitled countless spectators. Today does not have a shock value, just a good performance. <br /> <br /> While the cast is excellent, this is the first big role of Bette Davis and one of the best performances of Leslie Howard. Howard is the aspiring English-language artist Philip Carey, who is told with gentleness and firmness that he lacks talent and that his dedication is not a substitute for true genius. Taking the lesson very seriously, he returns to London and enrolls in a medical college (one, by the way, which seems to have no female students - at that time there would have been at least a few.) Perhaps the author / physician Maugham does not. he did, taking care of the medical doctors). <br /> <br /> Having tea one day, Carey is delighted with a waitress, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis in a morally lazy and basically evil farrago role. Her cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle's. His repeated attempts to go out with her are greeted with a half-hearted response: "I do not care," a sure sign for any man with a head on his straight head who is meddling in the depths. Maugham's Mildred complemented the advice of her waitress with a bit of strolling down the old-fashioned street, something that is not clearly mentioned here. <br /> <br /> Carey's prostration serves up Rogers' overwhelming need for financial support. He is desperately in love with her, she interprets him as an organist of the Sunday church effortlessly his instrument. There is no sex here. Recognizing that he is not getting anywhere, he begins a relationship of chastity with Norah, a woman who adores him. Re-enter Mildred, replete with a baby, and in your usual need to be seen. Sal de Norah disconsolate. <br /> <br /> Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a long-term friendship with Sally, instigated with enthusiasm by her father, who seems to see eventual marriage as something good for the two youngsters and an opportunity to be relieved. of one of his nine offspring. <br /> <br /> The movie reasonably follows, but not in its entirety, Maugham's excellent novel. Howard's Carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the film, his sad eyes remind of a cat that faces a double-barreled shotgun. Mildred is wickedly rampant, a user of the worst kind, her only concern for her own needs barely disguised when she tries to harass Carey with a thin patina of loving words (and offers, at a point that she promises to do anything). he] wants, "a bold statement for the times and one I'm sure audiences have understood perfectly. <br /> <br /> The precoded may be a code, but Mildred's quick dissolution would have satisfied the League of Catholic Decency The end is the loss by conventional sin, triumphs of principled behavior. <br /> <br /> Director John Cromwell performed excellent performances of his two main stars, one well established and one established in Much of it due to this film, it is worthwhile to undertake London and time travel. <br /> <br /> Available on DVD. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (for performances by Davis and Howard )
