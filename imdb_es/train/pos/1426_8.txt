I have to say that sometimes the only thing that matters is the "appearance", as Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC has pointed out (although it is not about our land, but he is right anyway). <br /> <br /> And when it comes to Mira, this movie is such an amazing beauty that you'll love what your eyes are about to see. <br /> <br /> And there is also the personality of the film, interesting, with a captivating narrator voice and a narrator. Stories that will touch your soul while you look at those beautifully filmed images. <br /> <br /> The movie probably will not affect your lifestyle, ruining these beauties, but it will certainly remind you how precious our land is in which we really live. is. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves its 10 stars, since it is one of the few stylistic documentaries on earth that I really enjoyed.
