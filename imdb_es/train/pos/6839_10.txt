['In what must be one of the most freezing movies in history, a transvestite is murdering people in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. You can see how Brian DePalma takes some Hitchcock influence with camera angles and stuff. Michael Caine plays a character that makes you think more, while Angie Dickinson is basically a rich and bored woman with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who later starred in &quot;Christine&quot;) is probably the most interesting character in the movie. But you really can not understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing it, you may never know who you can trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.']
