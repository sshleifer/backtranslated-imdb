All Kira Reed fans MUST see this. The premise of the film has the romantic novelist Kira, unable to propose new ideas. She is also overcoming a divorce. However, she meets this guy in a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and her clothes). They enter a room on the corner and they do it. Fortunately, Kira gets a condom (now you never tell me that these Playboy movies are not a useless bunch of soft fluff.) Remember the kids, safe sex). Later, she marveled at her publicist for how good she was, but she did not get his name. Despite this, the boy finds her and they continue with their perverted games. But in the end she gets tired of his cunning and wants to know more. When I do, all hell will break loose, and I'll leave it like that. This is easily the best of these Playboys movies I've seen. Watch this and marvel at the greatness of Kira.
