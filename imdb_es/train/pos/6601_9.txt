This movie is absolutely awesome. A new Blade Runner: the future noir at its best. The vision of Paris is magnificent, recognizable and visionary, with ample views, self-absorbed and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, with few surprises, but that's not what I like the most. About the movie. It is a visual treatment. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and rendered in black and white (no grays!) with just a short dot of color, it is less hard on the eyes than it looks. There are many "artistic" camera shots (close-ups and strange views), but that adds to the temperament of the film. In general, you have the impression of a graphic novel in the form of archival material. <br /> <br /> Initially I had the impression that the film had been rotoscopied, such was the level of animation and the high details in the facial expressions of the character. But unlike "A Scanner Darkly", which suffers (or indeed is reinforced by) an inconsistent character definition (just notice how some of the hair changes shape!), The Renaissance is consistent and accurate at all times. When the character is in the foreground, you can see the added details and texture, but when the details are omitted halfway through or more, but not to the detriment of the character's definition. <br /> <br /> For me, The only drawback of the movie is that in a comment we are told that this is a unique project. What a shame, since I would like to see more of this futuristic history of black cinema and especially in this avant-garde graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the dubbing in English is great too. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie and highly recommended.
