"The Navy of this man" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-filmed aspect of the activities of the Navy lighter than the air (LTA). The LTA crews were justly proud that the convoys they followed never lost a ship in an underwater attack. And filming at different NAS locations gives a valuable look at a type of aviation that has been gone for a long time. However, the first half of the film has to do with Beery, his relationship with his service friends, and he knows the character of Tom Drake and his mother, and he fixes Drake's leg. Only then does the second movie begin. The second film is mostly LTAs in action, which take an emerging submarine, kill the guys and cause a lot of damage. The appearance is quite harsh and realistic, I imagine. Then we moved to Southeast Asia. Did the LTA Navy there? No matter, this part is really wild, with an airship that is used to extract some crew from the jungle. And the Japanese are shooting like crazy. Shades of Vietnam, except that the escape is oh, so quietly. We are talking about an airship. In the end, a drama of World War II about a very unusual part of the war.
