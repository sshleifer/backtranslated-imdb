A film about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating, as only the truth can be. It also contains some pretty funny bits. Part of the performance is extraordinary, see Maria Hofstätter for example. The director has tried to represent life as realistically as possible, successfully. Coherently, the sex scenes are explicit and no more false than those of a hard core movie. Although I barely understood a sentence, I found that the vision of the film in the original language with subtitles was much more rewarding, because with the dubbing the great work of the actors is lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to duplicate by a doubler. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
