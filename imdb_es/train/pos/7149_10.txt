Hoyos is a wonderful movie to watch. He has good messages, like: being a good friend, never giving up, etc. I recommend it to everyone. I still say that the book is better than the movie, but the film gives your book a chance. In addition, Khleo Thomas plays to zero. That really adds to that! LOL !!!
