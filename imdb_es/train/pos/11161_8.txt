This is a very funny movie! I have no idea if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. However, I believe that men all over the world can identify with "Frank" and their thoughts to a certain extent. These thoughts are very entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie, I am sure. <br /> <br /> All cast members perform well, and this film could have been a huge success worldwide if it had been done in England. or the United States. But for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand Swedish, they are on a whim! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
