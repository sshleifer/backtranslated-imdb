I do not think I could have enjoyed it more, although certain things were disturbing. I will not say what, if you have not seen it ... you will have to discover it for yourself. In any case, what movie can be missing with the puppy dog ​​eyes of Robert Downey Jr.? In general, the plot developed sufficiently. Nothing seemed too hasty, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were capable, and there were many funny scenes in him. The general idea is that history is very well united, even if certain aspects can be unsatisfactory ... for a matter of opinion. But as I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
