I did not do any research on the film before seeing it for the first time because it was part of a set of Welles boxes I had recently purchased. A package that I got mainly because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and also reevaluate Waterloo. So I put Orson and Rita in the player and they treat me with class and confusion in equal measure. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the story seemed simple, the man meets a beautiful woman and saves her from a couple of thugs, they click immediately and the man receives a job offer on a cruise with a woman and her famous lawyer husband, and then ............. <br /> <br /> ... well it becomes a murder mystery of traced malice and many scams. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles himself) does not really know what is happening, he is as confused as the viewer, and it is wonderful to see him when almost everyone attracts him. Obviously, being pulled by the strings of the heart by a fatal woman of beauty like Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has her moments, but you know that things are going to have the shape of a pear. <br /> <br /> So many wonderful things In the movie, you have a visual style of Welles everywhere, see a scene in an aquarium that is wonderful and the final sequences in a fun house is majestic in sight. O'Hara's narrative is gleefully mocking, and we get good relief in light through a court case with Everett Sloane that sheds considerable light on the proceedings. <br /> <br /> However, the film is a rarity and, in fact, it is a choppy viewing experience, because {as it was to discover later The studio heads cut the movie in almost an hour, and that's not it only frustrates the viewer, but Unfair in Welles' vision. I am sure that a complete original cut of this film would have been praised and revered in bulk, since it is a very good and intriguing film, which unfortunately only points to greatness, but it is still a diabolically absorbing film that I am glad that I have to visit again more. 8.5 / 10
