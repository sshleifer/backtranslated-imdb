Everything was better in the last days. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily. At the time of this writing, I am fourteen years old, but even as a teenager I can not resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who have certainly been living under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is a horde of playful and ridiculous creatures called Fraggles that live amazingly on a rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species, such as the working Doozers and innumerable living plants. Out of the rock, on one side, lives the inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later becomes friends with Gobo Fraggle), on the other side, a family of the supposed rulers of the Gorgs Universe. The five main Fraggles Gobo (intrepid leader), Mokey (artistic and peaceful), Wembley (indecisive and friend of Gobo), Boober (a pessimistic domestic god) and Red (love everything that has to do with sport and general resistance ) are updated. In some strange situations, each episode at the same time he sings and dances away from his worries. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family program. The frames can have intricate details that the babies can not follow well, but the song -The dance routines and will keep your attention. The characters are strong and pleasant, their conflicts credible and their adventures exciting. The Gorgs are terrifying, Doc and Sprocket are illuminated, the traveling guy Matt is very funny (the segments of the postcards are very 80!) And the final episode, Change of Address, really touching. Let's go down to Fraggle Rock again!
