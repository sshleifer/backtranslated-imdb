I approach movies about animals that speak with care. For each one wonderful as Babe, you get an equally poor one like the terrible remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a movie that does not live up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a parrot that did not know what to do with my friends did not fill me with confidence. But the film seemed a pleasant surprise to me. And it manages to break through in your heart without you noticing. <br /> <br /> A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research lab. One day, he hears the song that comes from the basement. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in his cage singing his little heart. Misha is fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out that the parrot can not only sing, but can speak. And not a few sentences either. It is a parrot with which you can really converse. <br /> <br /> The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognizes a shipwrecked companion in Misha. Wondering how this world for the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell her the story of his life. It all started when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five-year-old girl with a stutter. The two became birds of a feather (OK, a bad word game!). <br /> <br /> When Marie's parents worried about their close friendship with a bird, they considered firing him. And finally they did it after Marie almost got hurt in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to meet with her, Paulie begins a long journey through the United States, which includes a diverse number of new owners, who fly long distances and even end up behind bars. From a cage that is! <br /> <br /> Paulie was one of the many talking animal movies released by DreamWorks in the late 1990s. And although she did not get the same recognition or blockbuster from Babe, Paulie succeeds in quite a few levels and is a casual work of surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to Paulie's part. He never interprets the role as too presumptuous, even if he is a slightly intelligent Aleck. Paulie is worldly, but he is also naive in his way. <br /> <br /> As he has lived a fairly protected life with Marie, when they take him away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. And when it falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to meet Marie, which he believes. Only those promises are broken again and again. <br /> <br /> Paulie is certainly a bit episodic. Follow the eclectic people that Paulie ends with, and how slowly she approaches Marie more and more. First he ends up in a pawnshop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kind woman who teaches her the meaning of manners. She sympathizes with Paulie's situation and leads an RV all over the United States to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Paulie is an occasionally very moving movie. His scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on his shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogues are pretty well written and even provoke reflection: <br /> <br /> "There are things in life that you postpone, because you think that I'll do it later, but what Ivy really taught me is that you have to live as if there was no later. " <br /> <br /> The scene in which Ivy dies on the way leaving Paulie completely alone is very heartbreaking Moment. And the sequence in which you gather the courage to fly for the first time through the Grand Canyon, to rise majestically is such a beautifully composed scene that it stays with you for hours after the film ends. <br /> <br /> Despite the occasional sad moment, there is a lot of laughter to have. Paulie falls in love with a group of parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant. The animatronic effects here are really excellent, since four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number. And Paulie even gets to have an affair. What is frustrated when he falls with a little thief (also played by Mohr). That may be the only complaint I have. As soon as he feels comfortable with a situation, the film moves Paulie to another. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Paulie is taught to steal money from ATMs is fun, but also a bit unsettling. I am surprised that DreamWorks has been given the opportunity to include a scene of this kind in a children's movie. And Paulie's diamond theft is an impossible mission. He was caught in the act and sent to the laboratory for animal testing, where he remained since then. <br /> <br /> The story is finally completed in the lab, where Misha swears to help Paulie. Of course they find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I fell asleep for several minutes. Paulie may never get the longevity that Babe has, but I think it's an equally brilliant movie. The same laughs The same impeccable effects. And the same surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> A minor gem.
