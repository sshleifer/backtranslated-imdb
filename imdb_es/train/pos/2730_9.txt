I saw this in the theater during its initial release and it was disturbing then because I'm sure it still would be. It was the first part of '68 and this was still going around in cities across the United States and recently there was a mass murder in my hometown, where I saw this where a man was the victim of a shooting. The freshness of that close-to-home event combined with this dramatized real story was a very disturbing theatrical experience. It really gave life to the excellent performance of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. He was familiar with the novel based on Truman Capote's true event and the script and direction of Richard Brooks wove the event and Truman's performance into a convincing film adaptation. The music of Quincy Jones effectively punctuates his story. I've only seen this a couple of times since then. It was too real. Almost like witnessing the crime itself and riding along with the murderers. I would give this a 9.0 of a possible 10. Society is so insensitive to violence and crime today that it probably seems slow and docile and can be seen with less effect, but for anyone over 50 it will be a hallmark in the exam of the criminal. Psyche.
