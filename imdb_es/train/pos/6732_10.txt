This was the best documentary I've seen! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and I wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and I was surprised and happy to discover that this was one of his films as well. Great job Stacy! Last week I was relaxing at work, I bored O * & ^% less and this movie went on. Growing up in Orange County in the 1980s, I navigated the local beaches and so did my father when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, surfed the body, rode boogey and then went up there. This movie just captivated me. It was long before my time, but it was amazing to see what these guys went through ... TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is a collector's item.
