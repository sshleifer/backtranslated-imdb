Hollywood early at its best! A classic poem by Kipling transforms into an epic adventure with memorable performances by a stellar cast. I think the measure of a good movie is the number of times you can see it and really enjoy it. I've seen it a dozen times and I still cry at the end and, admit it, you too!
