['Unfortunately, due to the tendency of American viewers to reject subtitles, this film has not received the distribution or attention it deserves. Its subtle themes of belonging, identity, race relations and, especially, how colonialism hurts all parties, transcend the obvious dramatic tensions, the nostalgic memories of the protagonist&#39;s childhood and the exoticism of his relationship with the &quot;godfather&quot; of his parents, perhaps the only one. Real, human that she knows, we will not even look at her mother&#39;s relationship with this elegant man, I hope I gave you a sufficient hook to assimilate, whether you speak French as subtitles or not, I challenge you to be so brave, strong and conscious like La P&#39;tite.']
