It's an excellent Turkish thriller that can make sense. Great work by the Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to point out the game on the screen. In general, the screen game in most Turkish films is not enough, but GEN has the best shots to say "perfect". And also the transition parts are really excellent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" has a great theme that influences everyone. Especially, a woman, who wants to be a psychiatrist in a sanatorium, has a mother who is a habitual madness. The main causes and the psychological consequences are given in Gen. All you have to do is combine all the suggestions. <br /> <br /> There is an impressive part of aggression performed by Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar. This performance may be more realistic than "Irr√©versible (Monica Bellucci)". <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you'll get confused"
