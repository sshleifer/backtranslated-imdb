I never saw this film until recently about MTC and I found this story about Poland and a small city that had to suffer with the Nazi occupation of local cities, like many other European cities, for example: Norway. The First World War was over and the people in this city still suffered for their lost soldiers and the wounded that the War always creates. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in the city. He grew up in a German and was not very happy with the Polish people and, in turn, they did not accept him completely either. As Hitler's group grew to empower him, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi to return and punish this small Polish city for the treatment they had given him, which was the only thing he had in mind. Marsha Hunt, (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer," played a prominent role as a woman who lost her husband and had a romantic relationship with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazis destroyed the families of people and their lives. The cattle cars are shown in this picture with Jewish people heading to the Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie and you like this theme, give it some of your time; This movie is very realistic for a 1944 film and a story that you will not forget too quickly.
