How can anyone argue the fact that Urban Cowboy was, and still is, the best document of Texas life for the period of time? Consider the following: men beat their wives, get drunk in bars every night, get married to solve a fight, commit adultery and compete in mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that represents real life so vividly. They do not do them anymore. It seems that current movies are always about people with a lot of money, they live in big houses, they drive expensive cars and they do not work. This movie has a celebratory scene on how to get a trailer for Pete's sake! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I see it at least once a week. Seriously. I dissected this film from end to end. Do not hesitate to send me an email to get more information about my reason for calling it a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy, they are divided, he gently honks his horn and greets him, she flips the bird around, he returns half of the peace sign that honks to add impact and then rips off. <br /> <br /> Mom Buds calls it approx. 18 hours after arriving in the city, on a Sunday, to see if he still has work, all he has achieved is getting drunk and lying down (x2), with the help of his uncle and aunt who cover him. <br /> <br /> "You all live like pigs" Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. It was necessary? Could not we solve it without showing the dirty sink? God, I love it! <br /> <br /> Sissy allows Wes to help her ride the bull. Only a few days (or possibly the next day) after Wes just kicked her husband out. Steve asks: Hi, Sissy, do you remember Wes? Oh yeah, did not you hit my husband the other night, so we're going to learn this lesson, not to mention the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one of Bud and Sissy's many fights, which by the way have place? in public, at Gilley's! <br /> <br /> The photo session of the wedding reception (oh, humanity!) could at least fix or move the chairs along the way. "My legs are sweating, mom." <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you do not put scenes like this in a movie to try to show a vision of human psychology. It is a real life documentary. <br /> <br /> I just wish there was a version of the director ...
