This movie is forbidden in almost every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese (?) Who star in this must have been really desperate for a job, or we're just friends. Here's the scoop: <br /> <br /> Three thugs torture a helpless woman to hell, use all kinds of things to finally kill her, burn her, kick her, spin here in a chair (more than 200 times!) They use torture with sounds (forcing her to listen to a static sound for more than 20 hours! It does not sound so bad at all, but it CAN make you crazy). She is thrown with guts (probably from an animal) while she is out of combat, and she gets scared when she wakes up. And who can forget the grand finale? THE GREATEST TORTURE OF EYES I HAVE SEEN! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have not heard about these movies and look at them without knowing it's a simulated snuff movie, you'll think it's! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to scare people and make them sick! As I said pure underground. Check it out if you're a fan of underground terror, or foreign gore. If not, I recommend you read the series before seeing it. Gore look, shock and creativity, get a 10, but from the story and all that is a 1. An underground classic ... <br /> <br /> My final grade is 8/10 <br / > <br />
