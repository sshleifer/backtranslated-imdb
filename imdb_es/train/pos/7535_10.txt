The 700 Club gives a great perspective on world events. Some have described it as fake or corny. I find the program informative and inspiring. For many, it is natural to throw mud at a program that has proven to be so successful. There are very few programs that can point to a successful career of 40 years in the world of television media and The 700 Club is one of them. While Mr. Robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be killed, I find it curious that so many people will literally trip over them to get in the car of criticism. Certainly I have said some silly things in my life. No doubt, I would be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson, since he makes a great show.
