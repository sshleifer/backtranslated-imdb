I teach Japanese for an online high school and I include cultural activities so that students can learn about the country and the language. And see "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent the movie. Stereotypes or not, this helps students see that other people see the world and their lives differently than we do. Many of my students have told me that they liked the movie a lot, that they will get a copy for themselves. It is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I just wish I could get a clean TV version. I do not like much the rude language that car workers use all the time.
