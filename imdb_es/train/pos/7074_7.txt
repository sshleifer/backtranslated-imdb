Terry Gilliam traveled back to the future (he had already done it in "Brazil") to tell this story about a virus that is destroying the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is totally crazy with some simple tricks. but it is quite entertaining and Gilliam shows that he has imagination (the futuristic scenes are great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (what happened to her?) Are fine, but Brad Pitt is so upset, every time he plays roles that are out of his hand, it is so forced and is not credible in all. He must simply play successful, handsome young men. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
