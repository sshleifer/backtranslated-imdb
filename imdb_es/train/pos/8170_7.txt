As if most people did not already have a nervous vision in the field of dentistry, this little film will surely make paranoid patients writhe. A successful dental hygienist witnesses the fall of his wife in the pool man (on his daily anniversary!) And fits perfectly into a furious crisis. After shooting at the head of an attacking dog, he goes to work and ends up eliminating his marital aggression against patients while planning what to do with his "bitch" wife. There are lots of close-up shots of caresses in the mouth, cuts in the tongue and beauty queen, as well as a wonderfully deranged performance by Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which he ties and spends his wife before ruthlessly tearing his teeth is definitely hard to see. A dentist is absolutely the kind of wrong person to get out of the depths and this movie explains it in detail. "The dentist" is incredibly entertaining, accelerated and smiling at times. Check it out!
