. . . It's as good as the original. Almost reaches the greatness thanks to the remarkable ear of Cundieff for music and dialogue. They skewer the arrogant importance of hip-hop owners. The group "Niggaz with hats" (NWH, for its acronym in English) are all rap groups you've heard and are completely parodists. The closet is incredible. Buy the OOP soundtrack if you can.
