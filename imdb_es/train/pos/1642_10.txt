I have not seen the movie since the first release, but it was memorable. The performances of Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were excellent, the photography excellent, the line of the story moving and everything else was of the highest level. However, it seems that it was quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the UK is a strange market, but I have not seen the film on TV or video, which is sad. Have you been more successful in the US? UU Where could it be seen as a fairly accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always recognize that 50% of a good movie is music and, although I'm not sure, I think the theme of the title was a simple but moving clarinet solo from "What friends do we have in Jesus? " The movie then went on to refute that! Am I right or wrong?
