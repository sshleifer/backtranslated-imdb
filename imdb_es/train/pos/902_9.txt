I thought that this movie was really cool because in Indian cinemas nowadays, all you see is skin, music and bad acting ... in this movie, you can see some tradition, ethnicity and at least some decency. .. although some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? That's what Indian cinema is about! After watching this movie, at least it does not hurt your head with all the overrated music, or any violence, it's just the truth, it teaches about love and, of course, how to take care of the person you love throughout life. I think it was an amazing movie ... Children can see it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be the safe depth of India ... until all these rap hits, miniskirts and exhibits of skin became part of it.
