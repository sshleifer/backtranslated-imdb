Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she is attracted to her pretty normal neighbor, Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She cast a spell on Shep that forces him to get rid of his fiancé and fall in love with her. Things are going pretty well until Gillian discovers that she really cares about this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he discovers that he was "tricked" into falling in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As for the comedies of the 1950s, Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing spectacular. It is a nice enough watch and should be liked by almost anyone who feels with it. Just do not enter the movie expecting the best from sliced ​​bread. The movie is cute, funny at times, and touching at the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do the best they can and have a real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) seems pretty amazing in a discreet way. The cast of cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester often laughs out loud and steals a lot of attention from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can not decide what kind of movie they want to be. Is it a screwball comedy? It's a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? If director Richard Quine had had only one approach, the film could have been even better and more memorable.
