For me, this is the most perfect film of Ealing Studio, as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was when it premiered. <br /> <br /> As a satire on the economic notions of 'growth' and the commercial need of In built-in obsolescence, it could hardly be more current. And from what other movie can you say that the hero literally uses the plot? <br /> <br /> Interestingly, there are parallels with Jurassic Park, in which playing with the environment will literally turn you around and bite you. But Spielberg moved away from the brilliant central concept of the book to address some nonsense about "children". Hmmm <br /> <br /> In The Man in the White Suit, Alec Guiness plays a young idealistic scientist who comes up with a fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out. Suddenly, the workers and the capital in the mill of the North of England where he works, are united as never before, in the protection of their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> Of course, being Ealing is a comedy, but it does not have to be like that. The complex interaction of vested interests (should they be adequate?) Is developed perfectly, since one by one all parties realize that 'progress' is a threat and that availability and waste are the factors that make the looms keep turning. <br /> <br /> But, yes, this is a comedy, although it is a pointy one, and in the midst of political ironies there are delightful performances, and some out-of-fashion good-taste laughs. <br /> <br /> However, it is the biting satire that endures - dazzling and white.
