You have to go and dig those holes. The holes just leave the troble, which makes a movie so good. Disney has done it again. Shia LaBeouf should be nominated for Best Actor for her performance as Stanley Yelnats. He has already won the Daytime Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series (Even Stevens). Holes is one of the best films of 2003.
