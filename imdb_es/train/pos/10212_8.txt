It's worth seeing this whole movie just for the magnificent final moment: it's the best ending of any movie I've seen. Perfect, beautiful, fun, just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I found this film charming, even with its French meaning that means in itself, very seriously what is happening. I loved it, it's a great love story. And I loved the way the Algerians wove together and, by the way, the music during the final credits is excellent. I want the CD!
