I saw this movie with my friend and we could not stop laughing! I mean there was nothing scary in this movie! It was funny that all the phrases that Freddy said were very funny! I think they should not even have made a new nightmare and gone to Freddy Vs. Jason Although some parts were disgusting (like the head when flying). and any street elm movie from 1 to 5 sucked. This was the best addition to the number 1. I would not recommend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you have nothing else to do, rent this and you'll laugh a lot. I want to see the massacre of the Texas chainsaw, I think it would be scary. The rating of Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare: B-
