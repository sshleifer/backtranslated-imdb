I finally saw this after hearing great things about it. It actually exceeded my expectations. Considering the budget involved, this was a surprisingly competent and well-made movie. The lack of finances actually helped this movie in several ways, especially considering the plot. Like The Blair Witch Project, this movie was better because it was filmed on video instead of a movie. Another plus: while most low-budget horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from a hysterically mediocre to involuntary performance, this film actually had a talented cast (except for one or two characters), particularly the two protagonists. The only thing missing in the movie was an original story. It is inspired by films better known as "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but if you're like me, movies of this nature never cease to be terrifying. In addition, the director keeps things interesting at all times. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and I have the feeling that it will only be a matter of time before we find out ...
