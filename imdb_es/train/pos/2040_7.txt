CREEP is a real-time horror movie that just wants to show people being attacked on an empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. And it does just that. Nothing more and nothing less. Director Christopher Smith draws the drama as far as he can by presenting a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be on the subway after it is blocked. It also leaves the origins of the titular creep deliberately vague (the illegal experiments that occur in the 1960s are indicated) and that little bit of mystery works for the most part. Unfortunately, he is undermined towards the end by actually staying away from a spin end where more genetic malformations would appear (they also insinuate themselves). Yes, you heard me right, I wanted a cliche end of turn! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Powerful is good as the terrified protagonist and the rest of the cast is fine.
