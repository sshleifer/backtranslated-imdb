['This was a very nice movie. A humorous, yet moving, look at the family, and the obligations it entails. The story of a man who returns from his life in the city to his father&#39;s bath house in a small Chinese town. There he learns to appreciate, even to appreciate the things he left home to get away from. The film is as beautiful visually as emotionally beautiful.']
