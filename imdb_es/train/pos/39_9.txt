This is apparently one of the first shorts of Shemp with the Stooges. (This excludes his many previous vaudeville years with the team). But the trio's funny moment is at its best here. Apart from the intense slapstick scenes, there are other more subtle, but just as fun. Look at Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or look at the real object that causes Moe's exclamation: "Oh, highly polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is in his state of most baffling laziness. And the bully can seem scary, but somehow it's funny. He seems as frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are the "normal" people in other shorts. <br /> <br /> For Shemp fans, this is an episode you should have. You will not be disappointed.
