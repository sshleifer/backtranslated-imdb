White fire has much in its favor. With the resemblance of Larry Bird, Robert Ginty leading the charge burning with his fabulous super macho hair and mustache, the film rises above other low budget people. The charisma he has in this makes Tom Selleck look like a putz. With Ginty hitting everyone, the movie only rises in an impressive way when a story of diamond intrigue comes into play. Then add Fred Williamson, some front bushes, attacks with chain saws and some incredible incest themes ... this movie ends with all the cylinders. If you're looking for some awesome B-Action, this is where it is. Now, if I can get that soundtrack.
