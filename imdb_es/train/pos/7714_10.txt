There were a lot of 50's sci-fi movies. They were great draws for the Drive-in theaters. Many of them were angry even then. This film and 'The day the earth stopped' stand out, and both have aged well in their own way. From the beginning, with his strange musical score of theremin (which still sounds weird, since they are almost never used) Forbidden Planet takes you where no man has gone before. Speaking of Star Trek, there's a lot of material in this movie that went into Star Trek. TOS is like a pilot for the series; of the interactive captain / first officer / doctor, the mad scientist, the strange beings, the baby in short skirt, the computer intelligence; Now everything is fashionable, but this was the first of its kind. In addition, it has a good performance and a work of art well done that even today evokes a certain fear of the images. Consider how the huge Krell machine is successfully represented with some real depth. I saw this as a child (in a drive-in: 0) when it was a new movie and it scared me. Of course, all the films that were even vaguely terrifying did so back then, but I remember that I was really worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that a sci-fi fan can watch several times and find something new with each visualization.
