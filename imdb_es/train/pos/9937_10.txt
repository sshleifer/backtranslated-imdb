This television series was one that I loved as a child. Although now I see it through pink nostalgia glasses, I can still say that it was a quality program, very educational but fun. I have not seen the original French version, only Swedish. I have no idea how good the dubbing was, it was a long time ago to remember it. <br /> <br /> The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, the school has not yet taught me half of what I know about this program. It is also related to other things, such as what happens if you eat unhealthy foods and do not exercise, with good examples within the body. Who wants to have another chocolate bar when you know that miniature virus tanks can invade? : D The cartoon looked good, very child-friendly, of course, but made with care. The cells, the viruses, the electrical signals in the brain, the antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures, which look a lot like what the animated body would look like. <br /> <br /> This, and the series on history (especially the environmentally frightening end) were key parts of my childhood. I am so happy that I found you here.
