I just saw the Fido World Award at the Toronto International Film Festival and I enjoyed it very much. Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been a pioneer (no doubt "developed" widely and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And, yes, I really think it's better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Fully credible and, perhaps even more important, pleasant performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'Sun Ray, of whom I suspect we will see much more in future performances. However, I must confess that I enjoyed Tim Blake Nelson's delightful turn as Mr. Theopolis's neighbor, essentially playing an animated version of Victor Van Dort from Corpse Bride (or, for those who have seen the film, he would not) Is that even better read here as The Corpse Pride?) And, of course, the Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his less animated role, but somehow deeply moving as the main character. He thinks that he would not have obtained this role had it not been for Peter Stormare's commitments with Prison Break (as revealed in the Questions and Answers after Thursday night's screening). I can not help but speculate that the writers should have been very inspired by the Zombi 'Bub' of Day Of The Dead. I'm not interested in revealing details of the plot during a comment and I'm not going to start now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those graphically bloody Zombie movies you can trust Romero. Rather it is a movie that will make you laugh constantly and, although (and I had to think carefully to be sure) there is a good dose of bleeding and violence, the delicious humor, so well improved by the surreal environment. created by Director Currie and his co-writers, it has been a long time for this to seem like a feature that should be classified as PG-13. I urge you to go see this little gem of Canuck. I will certainly buy the DVD once I leave with luck next summer.
