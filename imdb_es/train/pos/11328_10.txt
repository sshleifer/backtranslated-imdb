This movie is great. If you like watching class B movies, that's it. This is a classic movie from the 80s, in which a song is played throughout the entire soundtrack. A horrible movie, but it's worth renting it to make fun of, or just to see the old guys come out of the cabinets with knives. A little funny, if you ask me.
