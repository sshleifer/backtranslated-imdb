The story and the characters were some of the best I've seen. The graphics were good for the PS and the cut scenes and the voiceovers were amazing. I beat the game at least 3 times and I loved every second. I felt that the problems the protagonist was facing were credible and realistic, and I think it deserves a sequel. or at least a remake. If it had been redone for ps3, I would buy the system only for that game and maybe mgs4. It is also surprising that the idea and the execution of the dragon system are enough to justify a rent and in addition to that, the inventive, although sometimes cheating (stupid destroyer). Wand) Combat the addition system and the plot makes this game a definite purchase.
