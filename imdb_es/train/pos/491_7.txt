Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on a paradisiacal island where they will be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple but scandalous and fun. Let Fox throw morality out the window and let debauchery flow. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the program is that it was not about people cheating and manipulating each other to get a cash prize. It was about lust and temptation, pure and simple and the ultimate test for a relationship. <br /> <br /> People loved the show or hated it. It was something like slowing down to see a horrible traffic accident. You know you should not look, but you can not avoid looking. Drama aside, there was a lot of candy.
