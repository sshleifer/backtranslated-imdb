Robot Jox does not suffer from history or bad effects. I mean, this was 1990 if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used stop animation like most movies in the 80s. If you watch your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that were available in that period. moment. It was not until Terminator 2: Judgment Day was published the following year that a breakthrough in technology was made, and that historians began to use that motive. But you'll have good memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, even Power Rangers, if you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very threatening. It makes you not want to face man without a really good backup plan. And there are some great moments in this movie. A traitor / spy is working within his means. Whoever believes that he is on his side, supporting him all the time, could be the person you did not expect him to be. And it's very annoying to think that, do not you agree?
