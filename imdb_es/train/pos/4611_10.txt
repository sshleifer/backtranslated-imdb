Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Subtitles in Cantonese / English <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with 'The Matrix', and perhaps was one of the few remaining fifteen who still believed that 'Terminator' It was better than 'Matrix'. It was more than just a teenager, looking for a good action movie, and then a bright light appeared in a television station he had never seen, a small station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV guide that a movie starring Jackie Chan - 'Police Story' would be later. At fifteen, and after seeing 'Rumble in the Bronx' and 'Rush Hour', I said ... "WOW AWESOME" and sat down to see, and continually shouted "WOW AWESOME" as the film progressed. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the "Police Story" trilogy, I knew I had found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong policeman who arrests a major drug trafficker, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), is detained by the police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is assigned to protect her. Things go wrong - really bad - when Chu's case is dismissed and he decides that he wants Fong and Chan to die. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of the best action films in history, and certainly one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies starts strong and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed. Everything in the middle is great. However, some of the fun parts may seem a little insipid for some people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, this is one of Jackie's best efforts. For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better player in this than in the 'New Police Story' of acting and plot. This is not 'Milagros', but maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of Jackie's best works. I was hooked on the Jackie Chan movies and it should be a good start for any potential Jackie fan. The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan's movies are no better - 10/10
