Just a great movie, do not hesitate. Great history and excellent performances, whether Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindi film industry is being shameless with Mallika and Co, this film is totally free of vulgarities and, therefore, is destined to fail in the addiction to the vulgarity of our Indian society. But the message and the concept that this film carries are absolutely excellent. Anu Malik (bored imitator) could have been avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could have been used as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should have given Gujarati a little touch, particularly in music too. Anu Malik is the worst musician in the world and thinks he is a pop star, but this is not the film where presence is required. It looks good with Govinda style songs. I felt that good music with a couple of good Ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable.
