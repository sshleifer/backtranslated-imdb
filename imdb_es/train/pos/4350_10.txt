This movie is one that has a resonant familiarity. It's earthy, connected to earth and a movie that will make you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey that you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautifully varied and appropriate; And the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. This surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors! Finally, a work of art that departs from the obvious love story and the frequent special effects seen today. I have never left a movie with such warmth and feeling of consideration in my heart; because it felt as if someone had wrapped it in a soft, fluffy wool blanket. Watching this movie is finding a real treasure and delighting in it.
