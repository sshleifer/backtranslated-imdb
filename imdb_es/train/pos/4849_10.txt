The phantom train is a delight for those who appreciate the typical humor of 1940. It incorporates World War II in the plot, but not as much as initially thought it would be, and the characters are a unique mix that play their roles quite well. Askey, playing the role of Tommy Gander, is what illuminates the story for the parts that could be portrayed as boring or "dragging". <br /> <br /> The history of the haunted station is really creepy even for the present daytime standards. It is unique and the way in which the characters communicate with each of them is fantastic to animate the mystery that is the ghost train. Gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members, while the rest gets along quite well. He is always the center of attention and can be nicknamed as "annoying", but it is for those who do not appreciate the humor of 1940. His humor is innocent and childish, which makes it enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Askey / Gander, this movie would have been shorter in action, enjoyed and the result would not be as effective in my opinion.
