Forget about Neo and Bourne and all those half-invented modern heroes. They only seem to have 12 years to please the wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they can not be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allowed a lot of fakes that have no beard and still teenagers want to see something that looks a lot like an action movie. <br /> <br /> However, their "action pieces" are simply painful to watch and any girl can challenge their masculinity without questioning them. This explains the recrudescence of the oldies on our silver screens in recent years. For better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, get ready ... they have no beard !!) <br /> <br /> I say it's time for a new hero to arrive And put an end to his reign. This "Long Winch" movie is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least Tomer Sisley had a very promising performance as an action hero. And the only time it was weakened is when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rest my case. <br /> <br /> I did not know it when I entered the theater, but this could be the movie I've been waiting for for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo, a film can be well elaborated and rooted in the genre B without blushing for its performance. Meanwhile, all we had to chew was a gigantic pile of manure or something too restricted to reach a wider audience ... In other words, it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, of course .) ... I think "Largo Winch" has what it takes to be a popular and quality film. <br /> <br /> I left the theater room very happy and eager for more.
