Although structured totally different from Tim Krabb√©'s book, who wrote the original 'The Vanishing' (Spoorloos), it has the same general feel, except that Koolhoven's style is less entrepreneurial and more lyrical. The beginning is excellent, the medium is fine, but the bite is at the end. An emotional end surprise. As you can read in several magazines, there is some sex in the movie, but everything is very well done. Never explicit, but with great warmth and, sometimes, even humor. It's a shame that American films can not be as open as this one. Where Dutch films tend to go beyond the limit when it comes to this subject, 'De Grot' always remains within the limits of good taste. 'De Grot' tells an incredible story that spans over more than 30 years. When you leave the cinema you will move. What can we ask for more than one movie? Anyway, this movie even gives more ....
