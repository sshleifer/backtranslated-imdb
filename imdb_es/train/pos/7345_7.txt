I picked up the movie at the flea market for $ 4, I'm sure I got the value of my money! I could care less about the hot girls, but the animation left me breathless after a steady diet of Simpsons (Sorry Mr. Groening). The best part, facial expressions. Recommend multiple visits with some great tunes, good friends and a couple of cold ones!
