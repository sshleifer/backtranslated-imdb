['In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of Evil), Orson Welles gave him the role of an exuberant man. In &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; is the only time I see him in the role of the victim. The role of the culprit, he gave it to Rita Hayworth, I guess it&#39;s because he was in love with her. Therefore, it is an interesting movie. But the story seems excellent too. The direction is great, as is usual in Welles: two scenes are particularly bright: the aquarium and the end with the mirrors. This movie is brilliant. (10/10)']
