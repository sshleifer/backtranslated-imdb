Well, this is what I think of Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for the VHS tape and thought to myself, this seems interesting. I rent it and I take it home. Boy was right, it's interesting. They put the spirits of the killer in series in dreams, in traveling corpses and inside the daily machines. But this has to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I liked all the friendly images of snowmen that litter the landscape, the pot, the snow globe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, had fun with a killer that was not seen since FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right, I said it. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's that level of "cool". I wish some of the effects of puppets were better, the movements of the mouth could have coincided better. But I attribute it to a small budget. The cast does a great job, there are some great liners and scares to make any fan of horror jump. All and all, a great story, good effects, a great dialogue and a great cast. I give to JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
