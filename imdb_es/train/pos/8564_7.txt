I do not expect this movie to be well understood by viewers outside of Romania. This says something about the value, or maybe about the lack of universality of the film, but it also explains how the history and life of ordinary people in Romania were different compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is an adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who died during the communist government shortly after the publication of the book. It tells the story of an intellectual, professor of philosophy, whose life is crushed after being imprisoned for false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era. Basically, the first part of the film tells the story of her struggle to survive in prison, the second describes her attempt to recover her life after being released. His release is really only apparent, Romania of the 60s asks for different types of commitments and crimes, but still his struggle to survive is as hard morally as in prison. <br /> <br /> The film is performed splendidly by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who has the main role, would be at another time and in another place as a mega star, we can get a good look at his fabulous interpretive art. Although it suffers from a hesitant history and sometimes falls into non-essential details or comics of characters, the film remains an important milestone for Romanian cinema, as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historical values ​​of Romanian society.
