The 74th Oscars were very good. Whoopi's work as EmCee was very fun and light. I personally loved his last appearance, which got some cold reviews because of the rude language and the jokes, but that's fine. The audience seemed to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier made this program an Oscar broadcast to remember. <br /> <br />
