A word can describe this movie and that is weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old, so I thought it would be interesting. Well, that's how it was, the film is about a boy who travels through the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. Along the way he encounters very colorful characters and, ultimately, he must decide whether he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you're a fan of animation / science fiction, you might want to take a look.
