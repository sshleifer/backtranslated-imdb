This film is not boring, despite the high fidelity production and its link with the productions of Troma. A dark fable for adults. Exploitation is a subject of sugar cookies, and one wonders if the cast has not been a victim of that issue. A rare movie with attractive images: shadows and contrast are prominent. Definitely worth a look, especially from Warhol fans and decadence with style. Through all the cruelty and evil, it can reflect a moral, although distorted.
