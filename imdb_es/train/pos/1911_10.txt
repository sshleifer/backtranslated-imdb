I love the newest episodes with CJ and Grandad. I also liked the story with Kate in love with the director. I want to know what will happen to Rory, Kerry, Bridget and the family below. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with Grandad. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it is a merit of his acting that I have never seen him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and I totally believe in him as Kate's father. This family is very real and fun. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as in real life, these things happen and the way they were written and treated in the series was funny and sad and always very sensitive and loving. But in general it is a very fun show with lots of laughs and fun.
