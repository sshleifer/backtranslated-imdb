['Go see this movie to see the magnificent images of the sculptures of Andy Goldsworthy, and enjoy a relaxing experience and great attention. Music perfectly complements images, but never draws attention to itself. Some commentators felt that the fragments of the interview with the artist are a weak point, but consider this: why would you broaden this in a movie, if you can peruse Andy&#39;s reflections in his books, or attend one of his excellent lectures? ? This medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist&#39;s works, and is used expertly in this regard.']
