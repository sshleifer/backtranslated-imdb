Ossessione <br /> <br /> Luchino Visconti's debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with the launch of the neorealist movement, well, that's what it says on the back of the box, and it's a sometimes penetrating portrait, sometimes dreary of solitary individuals in moral flow. Set in fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters, including a naive vagabond who defends the communist virtues, embodies the remote desperation of a country that seeks its identity from the outside, floating ghosts that long for a soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the marginalized and his ability to express his pitiful conditions were already well developed, the spider's web of deception is tenuous, although a basic element of Noir is to postulate a protagonist manipulated by fate and femme fatale, here is Gino. so deranged, to begin with, that they fear that he deserves it: the cosmic irony is also didactic, the illicit relationship tensed with the bathos. Anyway, it is incisive and essential, although its real impact on the history of cinema is certainly debatable.
