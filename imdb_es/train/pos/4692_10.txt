Although critically defamed, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is a film that should be watched closely; Some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual attention given to them. For example, keep an eye on the use of Michael Keaton's pricing gun at the pet store ... and also the documentary style years that appear at the beginning of the scenes. It's one of those rare movies where humor hits you unexpectedly, although you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really sharp here. If you enjoyed your best-known films (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should take a look at it. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is extremely nice in the lead role and the cast of cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is excellent. Highly recommended
