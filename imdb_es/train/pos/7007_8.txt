From the first scene you are given clues about what may be happening here. It becomes more and more obvious as the story progresses. The acting is excellent at all times and these actors touch your soul. Even though I knew what was going to happen, the reason surprised me a lot. It still amazes me why Ben did what he did. We could see in his face "doubts", but the last sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings. It was a very interesting and moving story, but it left me confused. Maybe that was the point of the movie. I liked the movie and Wil Smith can ruin another good movie choice. This guy knows how to entertain an audience!
