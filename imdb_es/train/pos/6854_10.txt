The intelligent, elegant and convincing thriller of the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that is among his best movies! <br /> <br /> When a housewife with problems is brutally murdered by a strange stranger, the victim's son joins a prostitute to discover the murderer. <br /> <br /> Dressed to Kill left a strong impression on the audience of his time and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing configuration and becomes a heartbreaking mystery full of strong suspense. The ending and the conclusion are especially "nightmare". It's really a surprise for your seat. However, even more impressive is the elegant direction of De Palma that gives this film not only suspense, but also a unique and dark atmosphere. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic movie, but mainly in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film. <br /> <br /> Cast is another important feature of this movie. Michael Cain makes a great turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a street walker involved is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a valuable advocate as a research son. <br /> <br /> Many criticize the De Palma films for having Hitchcock elements and this movie was no exception. But any similarity between the works of Hitchcocks and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality, since to describe this film as a "scam" would be degrading to a thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> **** of ****
