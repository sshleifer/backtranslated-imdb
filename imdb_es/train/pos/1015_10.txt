['I look forward to each new episode, each re-execution in advance! The new aspect of science fiction created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder that I hope will never end. Combining the past with the future is a new twist that fascinates me. Season # 9 must be an emotion in itself. I wish Richard Dean Anderson would appear more often in the new season, since I love both his dry wit and his tantrums in his character as Jack O&#39;Neill. The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season. Cancel this program in the next three years and make a serious mistake. Also, you need a more important role for the Asgard, they are too cool.']
