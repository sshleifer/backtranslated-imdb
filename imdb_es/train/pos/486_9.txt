'The Luzhin Defense' is a film worthy of anyone's time. It is a melancholic and intense film, and it kept my attention all the time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a gentle and eccentric grand chess master, and Emily Watson is the gentle but rebellious daughter of a well-respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters are in history. All in all, this film is one of the best in-depth insights into the life of a chess grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a totally unconventional, non-cliche feel to the film. Most people will leave the theater thinking, and feeling a bit moved by this bright look of the most unlikely love stories.
