In my opinion, this film is, despite its flaws (which I maintain are * few *), an absolute masterpiece and a grandiose and glorious work of art. <br /> <br /> What Mr. Bakshi has done here is to create an absolutely beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films. He does not receive 1/100 of the credit he deserves, literally, for saving the art of animation for an adult audience. If it were not for Mr. Bakshi, I do not think the animation would have survived the Disney attack. In addition, with The Lord of the Rings, he has not only created a beautiful animated film, but has created a completely new art form, unfortunately one that never took off. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film (the use of live action images that are used as background images and are often encouraged about the use of various techniques, from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full animation). But I feel that people who complain about it simply can not accept an art form that is outside the norm. No, this is not Disney animation. No, it's not live action. No, it's not "cheating": what it is is a new, fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form. Something so fresh and so new that it feels like home in a story as fantastic as "The Lord of the Rings." Bakshi's pioneering use of this technique makes the subtleties of Middle-earth come to life, it is a very dark and mysterious way, in particular, Tolkien's darker creatures, particularly the Nazgul, perform in a way that traditional animation or the live action they have not been able to achieve it. <br /> <br /> The script by Peter S. Beagle (based very little, as I understand it, in an initial draft by Chris Conkling) is a very faithful adaptation of Tolkien's works. Whenever possible, use the dialogue directly from the novel and feel at home in the world that Bakshi has created. There are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 in a single movie of 2 hours and 15 minutes, but there are very few changes in the story. There are some gaps that would have been good to have filled: the repopulation of Narsil, the gifts of Galadriel, the Huorn at the Battle of Hornburg, but, once again, with the time constraints that it had (it is already the longest animated feature in the story), these are certainly understandable (although it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel). <br /> <br /> There's also the lovely score (one of my favorites) by Leonard Rosenman (who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (the score for which is clearly based on his LotR work)). It is grandiloquent and bold and, dare I say, perfect. It stands out for itself as an orchestral triumph, but when combined with the images of the film, it enters a completely new world of symphonic perfection. Far from the typical Hollywoodland food, that puts out many people. <br /> <br /> The voice actors are wonderful. Of particular interest is John Hurt as Aragorn, who simply oozes the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The character's design is also wonderfully unique, though not often to everyone's taste. But remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show him / her what he / she imagines, not what he / she could have imagined, so that Aragorn is performed with a distinctive touch of Native American and Boromir appears in an outfit inspired by the Vikings. Maybe this is not what you imagined, but I can only applaud Mr. Bakshi for showing us what he "saw". It can also be observed that he spent a significant amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien in the development of the costumes of the characters for the film. <br /> <br /> One more word: the Flight to Ford sequence, in my opinion, is one. Of the most beautiful and subtly captured sequences in the celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to slow down for a moment, and his mastery is clearly demonstrated by the incredible tension he can build. Bakshi's artistic ability and Tolkien's incredible work merge in this sequence with a glorious peak that has yet to be matched. <br /> <br /> The recent release on DVD (2001) of Warner Brothers, is very poor. While we can offer our eternal gratitude that the film is finally available in widescreen format, the package lacks extras. How glorious it would have been to have the comment of a director, to have been able to see the 20 minutes of additional images that were eliminated for the theatrical premiere. Another delightful addition might have been the live action recording that was animated later. Also present in the DVD release is the absolutely horrible voiceover at the end of the film, which is a deviation from the simple voiceover that occurred in the final frames of the film. This version is plastered and misrepresented just above the musical climax of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made. We can never see the interpretation of Bakshi of Gondor, of Shelob, of Faramir, of Cracks of Doom, of the battle of Eowyn with the Witch King or the confrontation of Gandalf with him. We will never be honored with the image of Bakshi of Denethor or the Palatir or the Paths of the Dead. It's a disgrace beyond all shame that, in the end, we have to accept the brilliance and brilliance of Peter Jackson in Hollywood, the action movie version of these later events in Tolkien's masterpiece, but I suppose even that's better that does not have a movie version at all. <br /> <br /> David
