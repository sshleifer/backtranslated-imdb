This movie is a perfect representation of The Nutcracker; The dance is wonderful, the background scenery was excellent, and I LOVED THE FLOATING BED. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the costumes ... I especially loved Marzipan's, the tutu was adorable. The special effects were very well done (for example, the tree, the bed, etc.), and I enjoyed the rats a lot. I love how they did not make them scare, but cute and huggable. Except for the king, I suppose. <br /> <br /> If you are a completely male person, you will not enjoy this, but this is a very good movie for all ages, but not for all levels. testosterone <br /> <br /> But I have some complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why did you have to put Sugar Plum Fairy's partner in those terrible socks? It would hardly make a difference if he were naked to the brim! And secondly ... why in EARTH did they have to make Culkin's suit PINK?
