That day, after taking a bike ride, lying down by a lake in a nature reserve, spending half an hour eating and talking to a donkey that lived in a beautiful field with a small forest, this movie made a lot of sense to me. br /> <br /> The image of the film was beautiful and that's all you need. Turn off the conscious control knob of the mind and do the work. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of Baraka (1992) but with the additional lesson of my previous paragraph. <br /> <br /> This comment requires a minimum of ten lines, ten lines is the minimum, not 9 lines but ten. After finishing counting all the lines, you realize that there are less than ten, although less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment.
