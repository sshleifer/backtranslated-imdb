Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for a sequel, I love Jaq and Gus, so I did not hesitate. The format of the mice that wrote a book for Cinderella was inspiring. I like to write stories and I hope that children feel encouraged by this. The three stories are cute and funny, although the songs were forgettable. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also liked to see Lucifer, Bruno, The Mice Chorus and everything else. Pom Pom proved to be the perfect partner for Lucifer and I liked the governess. A sequel well made for a change. My rating 8/10.
