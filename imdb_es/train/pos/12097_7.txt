This complicated story begins quite simply, with an English journalist accepting a bet from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he can not spend a night in the enchanted castle of Blackwood. Once there, the writer walks through the dusty rooms and corridors, until the music and a glimpse of a pair of fences take him to an empty room. He sits on the harpsichord and begins to play the melody he has heard, and is surprised to be struck on the shoulder by the incredibly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. She informs you in an ambiguous, charming and mysterious way, that you have prepared your room on the top floor and that you always wait for someone tonight ... the Night of the Dead. Thus begins a surprising series of supernatural events that baffle the journalist all the rest of the night. SPOILER FORWARD: probably not surprising to many viewers to learn that the lovely Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This does not stop him from falling in love with the journalist, but it complicates things for them that for the average couple. This is a fun movie, with absolutely everything: ghosts, creepy castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (although both have been toned down in the version that most Americans have seen in recent years). The seductive and captivating Barbara Steele It is the main reason to see it. She has a strange charisma unlike any other person you've seen in the movies. Recommended!
