Although it preaches on the subject of progress as the salvation of mankind, it is still an amazing film that boasts the sci-fi special effects box office successes that would take another 40 years to reach the big screen. Predicts the global chaos of World War II, but expands on the premise of having the conflict for the past 30 years, and then tells the epic story of man's struggle from the rubble to the wild places of space. The performance seems wooden and strangely sterile, but this is perhaps the result of its contrast with the visual elements that must have been absolutely impressive at the time of the premiere of the film, and that still impress today. This is a movie that can not be missed by anyone interested in the SF genre.
