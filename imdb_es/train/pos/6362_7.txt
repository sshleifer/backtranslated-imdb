Okay, I had seen a "Speed ​​Racer", but I had never really seen it, and I had also seen other shows with some of these characters dressed as birds flying in a boat called Phoenix and another that was circling a spaceship It looked like a giant ocean. The ship and it flew backwards sometimes for some reason and it was very dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five years old. This, although I saw almost all the episodes and the surprising thing for me at that moment was that this program had a certain resolution. It really ended, the bad guys ended up unlike almost all the American cartoons where nothing ends, like the last episode of the first generation of Transformers that ended with Galvatron and this new bad guy who promised to get Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids never coming home, with GI Joe with Cobra still out there ready to try again and so on. This one did finish and it had a pretty cool robot that got new weapons as the show went on, at first it was a bit tasteless since I could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons. As it progressed, it got a great fist like the one that used Android 16 against Cell in Dragonball Z, then that weapon evolved to include blades that were fired. Then, the great robot even got wings so that it could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. I would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a pretty funny one called Bobo in the United States. The villains were not only Dr. Hell, but a really weird person who was half man half woman and a guy with a flying head. Interesting show and it was nice to see a conclusion.
