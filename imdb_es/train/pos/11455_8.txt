This German documentary, in English, is about a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art from objects that he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film we see it taking sections of icicles and "sticking" them with a little moisture in a serpentine shape that seems to repeatedly cross a vertical rock. <br /> <br /> Of course, the icicles melt, but that transience is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to a site and has an idea of ​​it, intuitively deciding what to do that day. He talks about having a "dialogue" with the rocks and other materials he works with, trying to work with * instead of against them. It can be stones, or flowers, or leaves, or sticks. The sculpture can last minutes or years, or it may not last long enough to be completed and photographed. Work seems to be more a process than an objective. <br /> <br /> The film and the work are beautiful, inspiring and stimulating. It moves quite slowly, which is appropriate for the material, but you should make sure to go when you have slept well. But go if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Search the web for other pages about Andy Goldsworthy or read about his local sculpture at Stanford University. There are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: Skip reading this part if you want to find what this movie means to you in a completely independent way. I remember a couple of ideas that occurred to me while watching the movie that I thought I would share for those of you who are still reading. First, the transient nature of much of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We are born, we live, and in the end we die. That is natural and, of course, also part of Goldsworthy's art. <br /> <br /> The other thought was to be amazed at the way Goldsworthy has managed to integrate his passion and his work so deeply into his life. Most of us have a job that is tolerated at best, a life we ​​barely notice living, and passions in which we really want to spend more time, even if we remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgamation of all these aspects of his life that seems to work very well and that nurtures him and those around him. Wow <br /> <br /> Seen on 8/28/2002.
