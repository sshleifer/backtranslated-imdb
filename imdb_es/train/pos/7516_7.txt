The first two thirds of this Betty Page fetish biopic are very interesting. Betty, portrayed with great sincerity by Gretchen Mol, is presented as a nice person, girl next door, who saw nothing wrong in what he did (and certainly there was nothing "wrong" with that). The director Mary Harron, who also made "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", recreates Betty's America mixing old black and white images with new, degraded images, in black and white. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, the color is introduced. The notoriety of Betty was mainly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and skillfully executed. The first suppliers of fetish material are not represented in a condescending way and we have the feeling that these people were part of a narrow "community". Betty never had too much trouble with her notoriety, although we have the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the world of direct acting. Because the third act of the film is virtually non-existent, we have the impression that we have been watching a feature film documentary on Betty Page instead of a structured drama. Leaving aside the flaws, it is a film that is worth capturing and represents another fine feather in the cap of the producer Christine Vachon.
