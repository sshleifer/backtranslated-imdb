'An Itch in Time' by Bob Clampett launches seven minutes of crazy action from a very small premise. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself one more time, he will be given a dreaded bath. Unfortunately for the dog, a relentless flea makes it almost impossible to stop scratching. The cartoon changes between the progress of the flea within the dog's fur and the dog's desperate attempts to cope. In a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that can not be scratched, the dog changes color from brown to blue to red to dotted polka dotted! It sounds ridiculously surreal, but it perfectly evokes the indescribable sensation of an itch in a way that only Clampett could. There are several other elements that make 'An Itch in Time' pure Clampett. There is the grotesque concept, which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea chewing the dog's flesh. There is the unbridled violence that appears in any scene that presents the cat. In particular, there are dirty jokes that include a huge shot from the back of the dog that causes the whistle of the flea and a hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch by dragging its back across the ground. He pauses momentarily to address the audience: "Hey, I'd better take it down, I might like it." With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make 'An Itch in Time' a unique caricature based on minutiae. As an early episode of 'Seinfeld', 'An Itch in Time' is practically nothing but very funny.
