Yesterday I saw this movie in Turner, and I could not stop seeing it until it was over, although I could guess what would happen. Farrell was excellent in his role, and everyone else did an excellent job. Something seemed to stretch the limits, but in general, I loved it! If you have the opportunity to see it, please do it! In fact, I cried in some scenes, but I suppose if you are a mother, you would do it. Loretta is beautiful, and I was surprised that they were single mothers there, it seemed like she was ahead of her time. I say, LOOK at it if you can, and do not listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I enjoyed it very much!
