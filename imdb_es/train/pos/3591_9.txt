['I never bothered to see this movie in theaters, although I remember hearing the name again and again. Finally I saw it this week and what a delight. For some reason, I hoped it was not very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down, I was stuck and I found myself completely trapped. I read many of the comments from other users and I was impressed by how many people talk about their fight in the ring, but the wonderful thing about Diana is that she is a true fighter in life. All you need to do is find your place where you can be who you are and the ring helps you get there. A very smart story and I am surprised that this is the first time Michelle Rodriguez, what an excellent job she did. Adrian and his coach were also pretty good. <br /><br /> This movie is a bit rough around the edges, but it does not matter in the least. The story, the will and the performances completely overcome any failure (which usually comes with independent cinema). A compelling description of a girl who finds herself and triumphs over her circumstances and a KO for Michelle Rodriguez!']
