There should be more movies about our Native Americans. Especially I think that using the real real Native Americans would be the right thing to do. I know that this Archie Belaney, who was played by Pierce Brosnan, did an excellent job playing that character, since he was an Englishman. But my suggestion to Hollywood, is to put more American Indians in the roles, and never use anyone else. The Sioux Nation has been put on the back burner for too long. Your poverty is a disgrace for our country. I firmly believe that our country should return the Black Hills to the Sioux. We ask Israel to return their lands to the Arabs, but we make no effort to do the same, we must be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
