Fire And Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world. The film is about a town that is destroyed by a giant glacier that is home to the evil ice lord named Nekron. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn who intends to avenge those who were killed by the glacier. The ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the earth called Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn tries to find her and also seeks and murders Nekron. Fire And Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adult animators. He has brought us animated masterpieces such as the film version of Fritz The Cat and some films that he himself has written, such as the great movie Heavy Traffic. I did not like Fire and Ice as much as I have Ralph Bakshi's other work, but I found the movie enjoyable. It had some very nice animations in parts and the story was quite entertaining. The only basic complaint I have is that I wish there was more than one story in the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not much of that. I would also like the movie to be a bit longer because it has less than 80 minutes of execution time. Still, it's an entertaining action and adventure movie that, unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic, is appropriate for children 8 and older. I just wish there was a more developed story and it lasted a little longer than it did.
