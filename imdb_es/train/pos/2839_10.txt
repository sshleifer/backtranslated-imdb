I saw this movie in an advanced screening and I found it excellent. <br /> <br /> New York I Love You is a true twist on a romance that explores intelligent, funny and sometimes shocking situations around the most powerful emotion of the human race. . <br /> <br /> The cast is huge, a true Oceans 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. All provide outstanding performances in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that there is a who is who of directors interlacing stories in an intelligent and interesting way. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean, WOW! This movie is not a romantic novel or a romantic comedy, although it is romantic and fun. It also has serious stories and notes. But that's good in my opinion. Go see it for yourself and respond to my comment, I want to hear what others have to say.
