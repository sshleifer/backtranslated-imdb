I saw this today with my 8 year old son. I thought it was cute. I agree with the other poster that it was nothing like the book I can remember, but we still enjoy it. All the children are pretty good and, in general, quite entertaining. Billy is the new child who accepts a challenge from the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day. If he loses, he has to walk down the aisle of the school with worms in his pants. The beginning of the movie is set to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach and vomits on almost anything. Hilarity occurs with a lot of different ways of cooking worms. Good message on how to face the thugs and, of course, a happy and happy ending.
