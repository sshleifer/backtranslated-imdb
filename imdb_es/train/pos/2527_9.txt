This is what I call a "pre Sci Fi; Sci Fi" movie. There's nothing better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good "humor" type movie. These two genuine artists are at their best, just like the story line. <br /> <br /> Karloff does an amazing job as a scientist who is caught in a vision of vanity, pride and scientific competence. I was caught up in the idea of ​​seeing a man while drowning in the three concepts mentioned above. I became sad and, at the same time, I was fascinated by the two stars as they make themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that asks for a new version. This time he put Harrison Ford in Karloff's part and perhaps Kieffer Sutherland as the role of Bela Lagosi. It could be possible to do it almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Hollywood EVER produced. Like I said ... it does not get any better. No way.
