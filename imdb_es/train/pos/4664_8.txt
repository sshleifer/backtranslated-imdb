"Hot Millions" is a charming comedy that is made even better by the presence of the wonderful cast assembled for it. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the screen work and appears as the key figure of an entrepreneur embezzler. The film, directed by Eric Till, shows no signs of having dated so terribly, as others of that period. <br /> <br /> At the center of the action is a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who, before being released from prison, arranges the income tax forms for the director, who is surprised at the reimbursement what the government owes him Marcus, who is a genius in numbers, sees opportunities where others would not. He starts working for a company that uses the latest computer for his accounting, but Pendleton is an ingenious man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and establishes different false accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Marcus is assigned a secretary, who also has a floor in his building. The inept Patty is seen as a person who takes the bus ticket and manages to mess up everything. How she gets a job as a secretary is beyond understanding, but things are never the same in the office when the creepy Willard Gnatpole decides to go after her, but do not fear, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, who is an accomplished pianist and She is a flutist and together they make beautiful music. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is Peter Ustinov. He clearly understood how to play Marcus and escapes with the film. Mr. Ustinov gives a sure account of the embezzler. The excellent Maggie Smith is also at her best with her stance on Patty, the kind woman who adores Marcus and who also proves to be a genius when it comes to investing the money she finds in Marcus' pockets. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect as the American in charge of the corporation. Bob Newhart also appears as Gnatpole, the man who wants Patty, but can not match her. The wonderful Robert Morley is seen as Caesar Smith, whose identity Marcus has assumed. CÃ©sar Romero also appears in a special role as an airport customs inspector. <br /> <br /> "Hot Millions" will delight all those looking for a fun time in the company of that nasty but charming character, Marcus Pendleton.
