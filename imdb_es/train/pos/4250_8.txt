Todd Rohal is a mad genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third and most complete short film, has a sense of humor out of the ordinary and will leave some scratching their heads. When it comes to the movie in the background, and almost certainly would not agree with me on this, it's how a normal Joe finds the confidence to live life with a little inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. The short thing is to make rounds intermittently in the festival circuit, so keep your eyes open and catch if you can, you'll be glad you did. It's hilarious And check out other Todd short films that also appear here and there from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
