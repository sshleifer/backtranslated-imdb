This is one of the five best animated features of Disney, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to feature film animation (unlike the compilation films of the 40s), and the costly depth through the multiplane camera returns to the film in no other way. Although Disney adapts the story in a somewhat liberal way, the idea of ​​the time is picked up through the stylization of the costumes and sets, a clear period of time in which the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multidimensional character. Actually, all the characters are somewhat developed, except for the Prince, which is the one that makes the most sense. We know he has a sense of humor and a big smile, but that's it. Like Snow White, Disney has a permanent impact on the history of popular culture: in most versions of Cinderella, the stepsisters are attractive, but not as pretty as Cinderella, and her character deviates from her pleasant appearance. <Br /> <br /> Disney's favorite additions: mice! In addition, he appreciated the continuity: Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. The addition of the homemade gown, as well as the next assault of the stepsisters, was always horrible as a child. I remember that View Master showed this with a black background and a big red light on it! The broken shoe shows the unwillingness of the evil Lady Tremaine to renounce Cinderella and admit defeat. Audley would continue to characterize the most evil of all the villains of Disney, the satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.
