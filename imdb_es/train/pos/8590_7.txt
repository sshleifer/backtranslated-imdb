Seeing that Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in television history, it was an inescapable conclusion that he was going to go to the movies and spend $ 15 on this. I also think that this applies to Eva Longoria fans. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a leak that a Secret Service agent plans to assassinate the President. As the investigation develops, it seems that the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). By pleading not guilty, Pete follows the fun and fugitive style to seek the truth. <br /> <br /> It's solid, but it's certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story, but it left me a bit empty, but you certainly could do much worse.
