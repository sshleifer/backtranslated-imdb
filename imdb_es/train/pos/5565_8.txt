['I&#39;m a fan of C &amp; C, going back to their albums, and I liked this movie, but at one point in the mid-1980s on cable television in San Jose, California, it was broadcast with an alternate plot that destroyed the whole point of the movie. All references to marijuana were replaced by &quot;diamonds&quot;. The bag that &quot;Red&quot; drops to Chong has diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation remains the same (&quot;... worth ~ $ 3000 / lb&quot;). There is also a secondary plot in which alien clips were added on a ship observing C &amp; C, and talking to each other about how to get the diamonds. In the end, instead of &quot;space coke&quot;, it&#39;s something else. I&#39;m not sure who created this version, but it was horrible, and it&#39;s obvious that they tried to make it friendly for families and children. It would have been better if that network had not been transmitted at all.']
