The last chapter of the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides an appropriate closing for this entertaining series of samuraisplotaci√≥n. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is practically the same, perhaps because Shintaro Katsu was the producer, in addition to the titular antihero. <br /> <br /> Hanzo discovers a ghost that keeps a treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo is Hanzo, he is not discouraged by the fact that he is a ghost, so he proceeds to violate ... ahem, interrogate her, using the well-known rotating network device. The plot goes through a series of blind monks who also stay twice as loan officers, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary cuts and cuts. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comic notes and, in general, work as usual. <br /> <br /> Significantly less intricate and easier to follow than the first (which is everywhere) and a little messy), less elegant, dramatic and bloody than the second (possibly the best of the Hanzo series) , but still entertaining and valuable on its own merits. Complete with trademark training sequences, mandatory rape, sword fights and a mystery that Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will finally satisfy fans.
