Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a true adventure movie for the whole family. <br /> <br /> Before the real story of the movie begins, we have a presentation of the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror), and it begins. a good movie. After that we received a kind of collage of Michael carrier, until Moonwalker went on sale in 1988. After some music videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.) the story begins. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that Michael and his 3 friends (who are children) are being persecuted by the bad guy in the story "Mr. Big", because they discovered their evil plans to get the children of Everyone is run over with drugs. During the pursuit we see fantastic segments, fx. Video of Michaels for Smooth Criminal, who is absolutely fantastic with his dance sequences, etc. But then one of the children is kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael will have to save it before he acquires a drug addict. <br /> <br /> During the film we see special effects not only surprising for the standards of those days, but also impressive today. For example, go to Michael to approach a robot / spaceship to protect his friends! It is so cool! <br /> <br /> The film ends with the performance of Come Together (later released on the double album by Michaels from HIStory), and you leave the film with a magical feeling. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend this to all families who want to spend a good night with sweets and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can stand up and say, "But Michael Jackson is a supposed child molester!" Yes, yes it is, but, come on, we all know that it is not true. Wait and see..
