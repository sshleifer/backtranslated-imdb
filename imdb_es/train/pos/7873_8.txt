['Page 3 is definitely a captivating and captivating eye opener that cleverly exposes the hypocritical lifestyles of the Mumbai elite. From fake kisses to plastered smiles, it leaves no stone unturned to reveal the shocking lives of the rich and famous. Stabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal lurk in every dark corner of the world of glitz and glamor. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where social Darwinism is the predominant mentality. Everyone is constantly looking for more money, more fame and a higher reputation, which leads them to do the most shameful things that go from signing movie contracts at a funeral to child abuse. Anything is possible in this metropolis where there is such a wide gap between social classes. The public sees the ugliness of these two classes through the eyes of the protagonist. She observes the suffocating atmosphere and the hallucinatory frenzy in which people live in society. Bollywood, business magnates, politicians and the underworld are intertwined in a completely complicated mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a good track as is Kpy Main Doob Jaongi. Fantastic movie with excellent character development!']
