"Girlfight" follows a project in which lives a high school girl from New York, from a sense of futility to the world of amateur boxing, where she finds self-esteem, purpose and much more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing has to do with the movie. So much that you can almost smell the sweat. From the technical and artistic point of view, a good photo shoot with a sense of honesty and reality, "Girlfight" is not a movie for girls and not "Rocky". It is, rather, a very human drama with which even the spectators who do not know about boxing will be able to connect.
