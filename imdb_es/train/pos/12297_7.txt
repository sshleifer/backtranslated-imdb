Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> On her own terms, this version of Anna Christie de Garbo, filmed a year later in German with a brand new cast, is subdued and refined enough to work better than The English version (both are American productions of MGM). Garbo is, if he is something more dominant (or more beautiful as presence on the screen) and his performance is more moderate. And it seems frankly more comfortable, probably for many reasons, but we can speculate that he was not making his first talking movie, so he adjusted quickly. <br /> <br /> Without always comparing one movie with the other, this Anna Christie is still the same as O'Neill plays with too many words. Her themes of a woman who wants love without losing her independence are here, but she is still strangely old-fashioned anyway. Some scenes are missing: the Coney Island section is shortened and not as good, but in general it is the direct echo of the first movie. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), is simply remaking what has already been done, which I suppose must be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see the two films in succession because they are blocked exactly. in the same way (not only the sets, but the shots, they are all the same). There is an occasional scene raised from the previous film, something from the storm, understandably, but also a brief scene in which Marie Dressler (from the English version) walks with her friend on a board on a canal, drunk as it may be. But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their part. There is no replacement for Dressler, of course, but for me the German father is more credible and honest in his performance. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the issues: immigration, parents straying, daughters who resort to prostitution and problems. of finding true love: let's have strong currents at that time, especially with European threads (Garbo, appropriately, plays a young Swedish girl).
