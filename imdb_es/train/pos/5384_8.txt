I thought the movie was pretty well made for a television movie, and it contained a lot of action and humor. I found the value of entertainment worth seeing, and I would see it again or a similar program again. I am disappointed that Sean has not been accredited here at IMDb. <br /> <br /> I can see a possibility for a series of action based on this concept or a sequel with Sean once again playing for even higher "cash" bets, since his life would be back on the line anyway. <br /> <br /> I felt that Sean played the role very well, and it reminds me of an actor named Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux in Days of Our Lives - The Soap Opera.
