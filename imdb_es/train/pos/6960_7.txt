['A boy desperate for action tries to hit a beautiful girl on a bus. She rejects him, but when he runs after someone trying to steal her bag, they meet anyway. And there begins, a relationship that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can not be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic. <br /><br /> In short, a story that could promise to become a great movie. And in my opinion, it gets to be a good movie. It&#39;s not a masterpiece, but it made me cry when I laughed on more than one occasion: the two main characters turn on each other in a crazy love festival that, even with the idea of the superhero, is believable. <br /><br /> So. Thin story, but elaborated very funny and therefore worthy of film time. <br /><br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts']
