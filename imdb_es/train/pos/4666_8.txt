He is very astute for all 60 years of watching the movie. The mood is quite mild, but it grew in me much more than I expected. The cast is first class and it seems they are having a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders around the movie muttering some pretty funny things under his breath, and everything is very inconsequential; I will buy the movie as soon as it comes out on DVD. The plot is that Ustinov, as an embezzler released from prison, posed as a computer genius and embezzled money from a US company with an office in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, and seeing her say goodbye to many different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual expressionless person, and Karl Malden has fun as the dense, shoddy executive who runs the London office. The ending is fun and very cynical.
