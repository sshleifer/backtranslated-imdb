['I&#39;m definitely not in the target audience for this movie. I am a man of almost 50 years who has recently come across the world of independent cinema. This happened quite by accident, with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television. The first two things I noticed about that movie were that it was 1) technically amateur and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local newspaper and said that one of his influences was Clerks, I started to get interested. When he said that his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie he had seen on DVD the previous week, I decided that he had to go check it out. The result could be described in the same line as Clerks, although the two films have nothing to do with the content. Both films suffer from technical errors that are overcome through incredible writing. While Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life and is afraid to ask difficult questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who apparently forces himself to be constantly busy, always running one way or another, filling your life with little things so you never have to deal with the big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and moving. When I see it, I can see that it has not changed much since I grew up, young people still have the same problems they always have. The writer disguises these problems and issues in the modern vernacular, creates wonderfully honest characters and makes them do completely credible things. As far as independent film is concerned, this may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic point of view, it is very close.']
