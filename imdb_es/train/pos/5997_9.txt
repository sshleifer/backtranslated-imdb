Let me start by saying that I have never reviewed a movie in IMDb before; However, I am in the video biz myself. And coming from that perceptive; I can say, without a doubt, that this film is what a short film should be. It has a very good story and another thing that I love (an even better turnaround). The opening was very good, I loved the video chosen and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a B & W fan, but the way this movie uses the effect is that it works. And with any movie that is the only thing that matters. The flow of the film works perfectly and the editing was very well done. From a technical side of things (which is the side where I usually work), everything is also very well done. There is no important technology. things to point out. The only thing I have is that the final credits are a little inflatable. This is probably due to a representation problem. Let me also say that I would have preferred to see more of the love scene, but I am a boy (so you can attribute it to a male factor). <br /> <br /> So, in general, I rate it 9/10. . It is worth seeing if you are a fan of the Indies and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. I'm sorry for the bad grammar or the spelling.
