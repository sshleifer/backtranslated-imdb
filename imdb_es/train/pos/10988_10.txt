Do not read anything about this movie (especially anything that may contain spoilers). Just watch this incredible movie without knowing anything about it, and you will have a really fantastic experience. If you like to see an intelligent and twisted story: go, get the DVD and you will not really be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a science fiction movie, but rather a thriller in the globalized business environment. It's about corporate secrets, how big companies spy on each other's research departments and the methods used by them. The actors make a great performance and the general visual style of the film provides a perfect mode of coolness. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and, to which the story and the end belongs, it is also much more satisfying than the other films of "Vince" and "Nada" by Vincenzo Natali. Actually, it's one of the best movies I've seen (and that's something I do not really say about every fifth well-made movie). Sorry, I can not tell you anything else about this movie without risking hurting your experience. You just have to give it a try. ;-)
