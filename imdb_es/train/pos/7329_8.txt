I really enjoy this movie. The humor was a bit absent at times, but I enjoyed how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film. This is the only film in which I saw Verdone perform (the other one was 'Un sacco bello'), and I can see why the Italians find it boring, but he thinks he played a role as good as the loving father. <br /> <br /> My only drawback with this movie was that I knew it took place in Italy, somewhere in the center or south, I guess, but I felt there was no representation of a place. This movie could have taken place in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think it's important that movies have a place to give viewers something to relate to. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, then I think you'll enjoy this. It is not a Fellini or a Rossellini, it is not realism or neo-realism. It's a funny story with serious moments that can really happen to any of us.
