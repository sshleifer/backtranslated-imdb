Man On Fire tells the story of a special forces man with drinking problems who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard for a girl in Mexico during the wave of kidnappings to ask for a ransom. At first he is not very friendly, but then they become friends, he decides to stop drinking, etc., etc. Then, one day she is kidnapped ... and murdered ... <br /> <br /> And He will not stop at anything to take revenge. <br /> <br /> That's basically the story of Man On Fire, but expect some great turns at least a few times, including the end, which is beautiful and will probably make you cry. <br /> <br /> This is also due to the great music that Harry-Gregson Williams composed with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... The thing is that everything here is perfect. <br /> <br /> First of all. Denzel Washington is at his best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken are good as always, the great Radtha Mitchell and the INCREDIBLE young Dakota Fanning. And that is not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then comes the cinematography that is dazzling and together with an excellent edition, surely I should have won an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The story It's ... not just a revenge movie. History is intelligent, history makes you think ... and it is pure beauty. Seriously. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies you need to see in your life, at least once!
