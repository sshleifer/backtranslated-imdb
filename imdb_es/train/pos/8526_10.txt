I really liked that movie! Chris Showerman did an amazing job! Not only is he an incredible actor, he is also magnificent with an incredible physique! He did a great job in delivering his lines, and he became George better than Fraser. A great performance for your first important role! This movie is full of hilarious scenes that all children will love. My children have seen this movie several times since we bought the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as funny. Two thumbs up on this one! I recommend it to everyone!
