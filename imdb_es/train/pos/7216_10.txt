['Nobody better spoil this job! Amazing movie! Written by experts like Ira Levin and represented with the best performance of the career of Christopher Reeve and one of the best of Caine, this is simply excellent. I wish I could find a version on the scene somewhere ... maybe one day I&#39;ll do it. I hope that this film so underestimated and overlooked has not become so difficult to locate, since it is a &quot;must&quot; for any hitchcock, an Agatha-phile or a lover of the great movie. One of the few movies that I could not solve or predict instantly and that is worth seeing a second or even a third time, &quot;Deathtrap&quot; gets a 9/10 and earns every pinch. We need and deserve more movies like this!']
