['This film has slipped through the cracks of film history. It is, by far, much better than some other New York films of the same era, such as &quot;The French Connection&quot; or &quot;The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3&quot;. There is a great reality in this film that also manages to effectively use humor to improve the plot. It is attractive from beginning to end and has not tarnished with age as is the case with the two previous examples. <br /><br /> Ron Liebman presents a brave performance as &quot;Batman&quot; and it is a pity that his career has not taken off as a result of this project. <br /><br /> Gordon Parks directs it and, as it comes after &quot;Shaft&quot;, at first glance it seems to be a strange choice. However, it is the other side of that previous effort and he approached with so much machismo on his face. <br /><br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not available on DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really has a jewel in their hands and it&#39;s a shame they do nothing with it.']
