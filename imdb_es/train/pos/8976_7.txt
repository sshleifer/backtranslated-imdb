Starlift is a pleasant and interesting memory of the musical images of all the stars that all the studios published during the years of the Second World War. When you have stars like Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott, etc., in the film and with people like Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn who provide the music. , it is an easy movie to take. And the plot is not even on the road. <br /> <br /> The plot there involves two men enlisted in the Air Force, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, who try to meet the star Janice Rule of Warner Brothers using as a gimmick the fact that both come from Youngstown , Ohio and Hagerthy's father was Rule's dentist, as well as half of the city's. The scheme works too well, since Louella Parsons will soon place them as an element in her column. Yes, Louella is also in the movie. She must have liked that Warner Brothers or Jack Warner treated her more than the other studio bosses, because she also used this studio to publicize her Hollywood Hotel radio program in her day. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the plot also referred to the real-life efforts of Ruth Roman, who also played herself to get her studio and others to do shows at Air Force bases to the men and women who went to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at Travis Air Force Base where a lot of this movie was filmed. <br /> <br /> A specialty number was fired for the talents of Phil Harris who sings / narrates a ballad Look Out Stranger, I am a Texas Ranger aided and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper seemed to be having a great time joking about his image. <br /> <br /> This is the oldest of the clich√©s when you say they do not do it that way anymore, but they really do not. Because you do not have a study system that has all this talent under contract. That is one thing about the demise of the old system of study that we can cry.
