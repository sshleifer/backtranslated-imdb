This movie is much better than the original The Jerk. I would recommend it to anyone who likes quirky humor. We have incorporated almost as many lines of this film in our daytime speech as we have done with Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The card game with the hobos and then with Mr. Suicide. The scene on the dinner table and his disgust for the turtle soup. The original The Jerk was too choreographed and staged. Although I like Steve Martin, he seemed like he was trying hard. The Jerk Too is a parody and will be enjoyed by anyone. The Jerk Too is familiar, unlike the original The Jerk.
