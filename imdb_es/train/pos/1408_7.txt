A scientific team from the Pentagon seems to have perfected a serum that causes invisibility, but when the main leader tries it, it can not reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk with power, he becomes psychotic in the classic tradition of HG Wells. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly horrible story for the Invisible Man, presented with taste by the always elegant Verhoeven and Bacon as the genius turned into loonytoon-maniac. As with much of Verhoeven's work, he has a fantastic sense of the comic book adventure of Boy's Own (the secret underground laboratory where scientists' work is simply wonderful) combined with the most horrible and depraved images (women in underwear they are groped and attacked by an invisible demon, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and a total slaughter on the last two reels.Although the story does not sound with any new twist on an old idea, CG's special effects by Scott E. Anderson are incredibly bright, as we see that veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and flesh appear literally out of nowhere. In particular, a sequence in which the team brings to an invisible state gorilla and the scene in which Bacon drowns Devane in a pool, is absolutely stunning in detail and artistic invention of the effects. The film also has a great soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and the classic horror movie photography of Jost Vacano. The cast of young people is very much overshadowed by the technical pedigree of the film, but both Shue and Dickens are impressively out of their depth. This is a very funny and unpleasant movie.
