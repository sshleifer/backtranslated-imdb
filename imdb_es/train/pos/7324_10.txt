My favorite movie of personal terror. From the long first shot to the final spin of the story, this is Carpenter's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> On Halloween night of 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All the saints, until the eve of 1978, Michael escapes from the sanatorium of Smith's Grove. On Halloween night, Michael has returned home to murder again. <br /> <br /> The story is perfectly simple, Michael stalks and kills the nannies. There are no bells or whistles, just the basics. It is Carpenter's almost overloaded terror atmosphere that generates the tension. As in any great horror movie, the events are telegraphed well in advance, however, they seem to happen randomly, without allowing the audience to have a chance to guess the movie. <br /> <br /> The dark lighting, the constant - The camera shots, and (most importantly) that damn mysterious music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes that I have not yet seen in the film. There is a body count, but compared to the large number of shooters after this, it is quite small. That and most of the murders are almost bloodless. Fear is not in death, but in not knowing. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. PJ Soles provides much of the limited humor of the films (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis becomes a decent performance and then there is the young (at that time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. At first, her performance seems timid and she is not sure, but quickly you realize that she is perfect for the character, who is shy and insecure and is not prepared for what she has to face. And, of course, there's the perfect cast of Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unsteady) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace, Mr. Pleasence. <br /> <br /> If the film has a harmful defect, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago, almost innumerable clones, copies, scams and imitators have appeared and stolen (usually badly) the best parts of the movie until almost everything has become familiar. Combined with the changes for the expectations and the appetite of the audience, one finds much of the raw power of the films diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and time, it must be seen as it once was, as something unique. <br /> <br /> However, I have no reservations in recommending this movie to anyone looking for a good, scary time. Maximum Reguards. <br /> <br /> 10/10
