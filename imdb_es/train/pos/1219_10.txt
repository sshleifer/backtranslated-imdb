The second Care Bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor. It has a deeper plot, a better development of the character and the melodies (especially the closing song) are sticky and good-hearted. Sure the movie tends to worry more about stress, but come on, it's a Care Bears movie. This film is an excellent image to show the children because it emphasizes friendship, love and, again, care. Not to mention that Care Bears are too adorable!
