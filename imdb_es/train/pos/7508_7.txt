Great performance by Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopics to hit the screen in a long time. While it covers most of Bettie's young life, she also manages to stay on a mainly focused path that is something that most biographical films seem to lack. There is a charming and alarmingly funny subtext in dialogue and acting. This movie is an excellent break from the Dir. Of "American Psycho", and I think this will be shown as his best work to date. Oh, and as an amateur filmmaker, I give this film 100% in the movie department. It was amazing how well they achieved a look from the 50s with modern movies. Acknowledgments to the D.O.P. All very nice. I recommend to anyone interested to see it: 8/10.
