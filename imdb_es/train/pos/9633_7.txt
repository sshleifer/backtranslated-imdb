In many ways, DIRTY WORK is a short predictable L & H on the surface with the guys that are going to sweep someone's fireplace. Guess what happens next? That is the correct slapstick at its most successful moment. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two things that seem atypical. Ollie, for example, is very unpleasant, he is arrogant, he is rude, and not only Stan observes the way he addresses the servant with "HEY YOU" and gets angry very easily. His phrase is "I have nothing to say". In short, Ollie plays a stalker in a very unpleasant way and I prefer to see him play the arrogant coward, where he is always at his most fun time. <br /> <br /> DIRTY WORK also lacks the regular reports of others L & H shorts like Finlayson, Long, Busch and Housman, which means that when we change to the crazy scientist's plot, there is a slightly creepy atmosphere that fades with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that this is still a good short. mainly to Stan. Also be careful with a scene with a fish. Many jokes / plots of L & H have fish and this is another.
