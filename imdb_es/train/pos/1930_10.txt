['This movie is hilarious, original and beautifully directed. I have become a BIG BAD SWIM groupie, tracing it at film festivals whenever and wherever I can. I have already seen it half a dozen times, and each time, the enthusiastic response of the audience has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films that have been released in years. In almost all the festivals that were screened, they sold out or won the Audience Favorite Award. It&#39;s clear that people love this movie, and even more clearly why they do it. The cinematography is excellent, the characterization and brilliant acting, the fantastic ending and the direction full of compassion, wisdom and the art of perfect timing. It&#39;s hard to believe that this is Ishai Setton&#39;s first film. I hope it will be released soon so that everyone can see it.']
