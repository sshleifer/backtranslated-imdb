Well, I do not agree with the other published comment. Stones is much better than Magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned. <br /> <br /> Especially about non-real characters, I think someone wrote it only because he never lived in Spanish society like me. (and I'm not Spanish), it's a very real movie with real characters, very well done by one of the best Spanish actresses Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> about being a European film in contrast to an American film, well, we are different societies, personally I really like modern American movies (I like the classics and some of Andy American's films, but they are very few). <br /> <br /> It is a film about the continuous Constitution of a person, whether we all like it or not, we make mistakes, but some can learn about mistakes.
