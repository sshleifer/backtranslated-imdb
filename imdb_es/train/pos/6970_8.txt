This is one of those movies / pilot in which if you know BattleStar Galactica, it helps you, but it's not necessary. What makes this story even more credible than BSG is that this is not so far in the future. This is so deep that it is quite surprising that it has not been released in a theatrical way. The leaders could not have been better chosen in actors with so much talent and with so much experience. Eric Stoltz is excellent as the father who will do whatever it takes to reunite with his daughter no matter how real or not, and he will do it no matter what the cost. Paula Malcomson, from "Deadwood", is also great as his wife. You're not completely sure of your motives, be it love, money or both, but that's what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in the performance of Zoe played by the relatively unknown Alessandra Torresani and her performance. Esai Morales is excellent in her desire to see her loved one again and how wrong it is to be considering what she wants more than her moral objections. I did not think that this would be a good idea when it was announced, but only for the pilot I am delighted to see how we came to the history of BSG. It's great to see Adama as a child who is already being affected and influenced by the different types of Robots that begin to permeate life at this stage. I just hope they can follow the stories so we can discover even more how they got the Humanoid typed robots. This is an almost perfect driver and I hope you can continue telling the fantastic story. Even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage that is seen on the big screen. If you have not got into BSG, @ at least try this and I bet you will become a fan and want to see how the story of BSG came about.
