This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then, on 11/21/01 I saw the 30th anniversary of this movie DVD. WOW I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is so good, it has 30 additional minutes that the original did not have. I did not know this when I started to look for the first time. The movie did much more since then. The music they cut must have been left inside. You have not seen this movie until you saw the full 131 min version. Many people say that music is forgettable. I remember each song in this memory film, each song has its own charm by itself and joins like a hole. I remember when I was younger I had the song "Eglantine" stuck in my head for days at a time. In addition to "Briny Sea" (that song was destined to marry poppens, but it was eliminated from the movie) Please Watch the new 30th movie and vote again for this movie. The 10 that it really is.
