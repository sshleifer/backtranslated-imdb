['The barbarians may not be the best movie any of us have seen, but in reality .......... It&#39;s so funny ... I can not describe how I laughed. when I saw it for the first time ... The director really wanted to make a serious adventure movie, but it&#39;s so bad ... so bad that it&#39;s one of the funniest movies I&#39;ve seen ... so my advice is that see it ... and if they did, see it again!']
