I like this movie because it is a good film work, made by people who care enough to be art and not just home movies. It's full of super-surfer Greg Noll's home movies, and a host of other amateur videos that align with his 50-year passion. However, it has expanded to the point that it approaches aesthetic glory. It is full of artistic talent and athletic talent, however trivial you may think surfing is athletic. Surfers are not astronauts or test pilots. Neither are surgeons (perhaps) or doctors (again, perhaps). Believe in the search for the surfer. Believe in the beauty of human madness. Believe in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. The surfers celebrate the end of the war on the north beach of a Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years before. It celebrates the dead time of a country that fought a cold war, instead of a hot war, with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the definitive narcissism. It is dangerous, but only a little historical. I suspect that Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he received. This movie does not have military heroes. It has no weapons. The only conquest of beach-front surfers has a beer stand and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not hopeless. It is the joy of the exhalation.
