['I was disappointed, if it has not surprised me, the lack of recognition that this film has received. Once again, Billy Zane proves he is more than just a cute little Hollywood kid in a silent performance that combines a spastic slap with a sober pat. Calling this a silent movie is inaccurate, since there is a lot of music and sound. It has a manic rhythm and is full of inventive nonsense for which Ed Wood is finally starting to be appreciated. Look at the list of actors, and realize that everyone shines. Nobody is there just to show his face. I think they&#39;re all in the movie to show their appreciation for Wood, and to do a broad, physical type of acting that you do not see much these days. <br /><br /> But, nowadays, the reviewers try to guess what is going to become a success much more than any kind of aesthetic appreciation of a film. And IWUETDID does not have a discernible target audience. It was done primarily out of love for Wood&#39;s writing. Even after his death, fashionable social parasites hit him another serious blow and deprived the world of a minor classic. This is a highly entertaining and genuinely experimental film that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.']
