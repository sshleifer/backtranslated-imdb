This film is about the Irish rebellion in the 1920s and, more specifically, about the life of a man after informing a friend about the reward for his head and the aftermath. When watching the movie, I have the feeling that you can take the script and with just a few minor updates, do it again and, unfortunately, it would still fit contemporary events. But the remake would not be so good. A magnificent performance by Victor McLaglen (for which he deservedly won an Oscar) and an excellent cast that includes most, if not all, actors with brogues in Hollywood at that time, most of them recognizable actors either established in that moment or just starting. A very good movie that is worth seeing. Highly recommended
