Man on Fire, is definitely one of the best drama / crime thrillers I've ever seen. Despite having a slow start, the story is so incredibly complex and sensitive that it stays pretty good. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington, in which he plays a bodyguard, named Creasy, tormented by his past and alcoholic, but never abandons his duty to save his last protege, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very intelligent and enthusiastic girl who loves so many things and acts in a very convincing way, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said, the story is somewhat complicated. To understand it completely, you should see it a couple of times. <br /> <br /> This movie is made in two parts, there is a first hour, where everyone is happy. , nothing happens, everyone is living their happy lives until the abduction of Pita takes place and Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part, the rest of the movie, where suddenly everything gets complicated and becomes a bit frightening and disturbing, when Creasy recovers from his serious injury and begins to pursue and kill the numerous criminals and "La Hermamdad" "who were responsible for the planning. and the execution of Pita's kidnapping. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his most current acting talents along with many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It's a real pity that this film has not been recognized enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, as did Fanning and the director. And maybe even the visual effects that were of very high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like excellent suspense thrillers, slightly disturbed, this is the one you should see. The most surprising thing is that the elements of this movie are based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
