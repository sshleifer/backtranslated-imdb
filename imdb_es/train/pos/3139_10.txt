There are many types of reunion shows. A guy is where the old actors are taken out of the naphthalene balls and programmed to recreate characters they have not played in twenty or thirty years. These have mixed results. "Return to Mayberry", despite some nonsense, was fine; `Return to Green Acres' as execrable (Eddie Albert used a word for the script that I will not repeat here, but both he and the movie suck); 'Rescue from Gilligan's Island' filled a necessary gap in the history of the shipwrecked, although the show itself was stupid even from the point of view of `Gilligan's Island '. In most cases, the scripts are weak; Sometimes stupidity appears in scripts that is too wise? and in comedy it is almost always fatal for the characters to know that they are being funny. New characters are introduced that do not fit into the mix. In general, these reunion shows are quite weak. A second type of "reunion" show is the type in which the cast leaves aside its past, but sits around it, telling stories, recalling, interspersed with flashbacks of the shows. Then there are films based on the shows, which are rarely good; and movies based on the program's history ('The Brady Bunch' has had both problems, with several results). <br /> <br /> `Return to the Batcave 'uses almost all of the above, with a wonderfully twisted point of view, which makes it the best of the reunion shows, and has raised the bar for others. <br /> <br /> Adam West and Burt Ward and they called a sample of the original Batmobile. While they are there, the car is stolen. <br /> <br /> The Adam West of the movie is an insane man. He called Jerry, his butler, 'Alfred.' He opens a bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden stick that slides into the parking lot. He is obsessed with being a crime fighter, when in reality he is no more than a finished actor. When the Batmobile is stolen, he not only believes that it is his duty as a crime fighter to recover it, but that he drags and does not want Burt Ward as his assistant. <br /> <br /> The search is largely loquacious, with West and Ward remembering about the old days. It's broken by "flashbacks" with actors playing West and Ward in the old days. The modern scenes and the "flashbacks" have the strange lack of reality that kept the show. There is also gossip that shows that West can make fun of himself: in Ward's book about his time on the show, he spoke frankly about West's libido and also that he's a skinny (West makes Ward pay for everything he's looking for. in your search, down to tips and bus tickets). The tracks that follow, the characters they know (even in flashback) fit the mentality of the previous series, and there are several tributes, including a fistfight with written sound effects. <br /> <br /> All this is very funny and done with great style. There are also cameos by Julie Newmar (who seems to have had a renovation too) and Frank Gorshin, who reminds us why he has so many cult followers. Gorshin will be the Riddler when Jim Carey, his obvious successor, is forgotten for a long time. The movie is based on a pretty obvious but fun climax. <br /> <br /> Is this program a model for the reunion shows? unfortunately, there are few that can fit the pattern. This show made the actors repeat their old characters; young actors who play a movie about the performance of the show; the actors West and Ward remembering; and a modern movie with the real Adam West playing the demented Adam West. Has it all. If you loved the previous show, this is the bottle cap.
