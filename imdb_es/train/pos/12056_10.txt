Although I have loved the movies of haunted houses like Amityville and Poltergeist, this made the television adaptation of the Susan Hills book packages a great blow to the horrors of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> With a brilliant cast (many of which star in Heartbeat and other television dramas), an excellent performance and a fantastic setting (which convincingly portrays 1920's life), it has all the right ingredients for attract the viewer to what is a powerful ghost story. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence or gore to send shivers down the spines of an audience. Using her own imagination, the Woman in Black is a figure of fear and fear, and whose presence is never absent once it appears for the first time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Arthur Kidd, a lawyer, learns about his invisible spectrum. in his mission to solve the farm. The widow dies and Arthur spends a few nights inside his sad home in which he notices many oddities, which can haunt him for a few days. Some of the scenes are very disturbing and claustrophobic, particularly the closed room that opens, which turns off the generator and closes Arthur in the dark. The movie becomes more heartbreaking the more you put on Arthurs shoes, and your efforts to shake this ghost. The writer puts many chilling additions into the story, one example is the reappearance of the tin soldier. One is eager to learn the meaning of everything. The fact that we have never learned much about the widow leaves more to the imagination and makes it even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The widow for the most part, seems cruel and intimidating. The scene after the generator went off sent me shivering, a woman who appears out of nowhere in isolated swampy land with a howling wind? having been in such properties myself I can appreciate how isolating this is. And the scene at the inn was perhaps the most horrible things I've seen, one that I do not want to see in a hurry or show to older relatives. I have often woken up at night thinking I was behind me while I was sleeping. <br /> <br /> The Woman In Black is a great television movie and a lost gem. I agree to some extent that the Internet advertising for this movie has been totally overblown and I can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of Â£ 50 on it, but I think the network has defeated hidden gems because it makes which movies like these are overexposed. . I think it's still brilliant and it acted fantastically and I consider it the best ghost story of the last century.
