One of the great classic comedies. It's not a slapstick comedy, it's not a heavy drama. A satirical and funny movie, a guide for the care of the buyers of a new home. <br /> <br /> Filled with great characters, all convinced, Cary Grant is convinced that they will fly in the construction of the house of their dreams. <br /> <br /> A great look at life in the late 40s. <br /> <br />
