I'm not a father, I'm not a man either. But I could identify with the pains and pains of all the characters. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that teenagers should see. Maybe that way they will begin to appreciate the value of the family again. I am sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role from Bobby Ewing. And it's great to see Ben Affleck, 19, give the best of himself in a heartwarming and sincere performance. He showed at an early age, that he is capable of a sincere drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Watch Hollywoodland ... his first serious role in years and he went out and won the Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This film can be appreciated by people of all ages. Maybe it should not be seen by children under 10 because they might fear that the same thing happens to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and I've seen it. With friends many times. Because it portrays the values ​​that are important in life.
