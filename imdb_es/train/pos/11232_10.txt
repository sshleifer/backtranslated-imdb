Well, the first few seasons took a while to get going in special effects mode, but from the beginning, Hidden Frontier has always given good stories and performances, and they have always been willing to make the mistakes they have made. They advise people to watch the newest episodes first, so they can see how good the program is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. The cast has a fantastic camaraderie and is displayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of guest actors who leave their mark on the program and with the fans also testifies to the show, as the lines of the story go from strength to strength. The program has pushed the barriers with its various history lines (depression, drug addiction and homosexuality in general), and these may have affected some people in the wrong way, but that's what Star Trek is about. It portrays these lines of the story in an intelligent and emotional way, treating them with subtlety and without problems. <br /> <br /> Yes, they have used some characters from the history of Trek, but they have done them justice: characters like Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, very underutilized in the program, had a rebirth in the books of the New Frontier , but they lost their sizzle after a while, when Peter David became more infuriated in wild fantasy instead of serious science fiction, and HF shows those characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and can meet the people involved. They release bloopers for each episode, so that fans can see the laughter they have, because they are people who do it in their free time, with a dedication that would make many professional actors surprised! <br /> <br /> What this series, which is now coming to an end after 7 years, has been achieved with such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of astounding: bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same. HF will live long after it ends, as long as people still enjoy the reason why it started in the first place.
