When I saw the elaborate DVD box for this and the terrible statue of the Red Queen, I was sure that I was going to be disappointed, but surprise, surprise, I loved it. Complicated nonsense, of course, and unforgivable, that such a complicated outcome should be hurried to the point that you can hardly read the subtitles, let alone assimilate the ridiculous explanation. These objections aside, however, the movie is a dream. Fabulous women with fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and everything constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful score by Bruno Nicolai. It may not be Morricone, but in these lighter pieces it could also be. Really nice with a lot of color, a lot of sensuality, some bloody murders and minimal interference from the police. Super.
