Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There's nothing I did not like about this movie. Cross Eyed received a beautiful shot. Adam does a great job, not only developing the main characters, but also the supporting characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to all the low budget movies out there. That you do not have to spend a lot to create something worth seeing. There is something to like for everyone. If you had a terrible roommate. If you have ever chosen an idiot in high school. If you have ever parked anywhere in the city. If you have some kind of sense of humor, you will love this movie. This is the kind of movie that will be available for a long time and will reappear once Adam makes a bigger name. I look forward to Adam's future projects.
