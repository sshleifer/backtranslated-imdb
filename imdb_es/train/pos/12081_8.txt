Nina Foch offers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little gothic nail biter. She accepts a position as secretary of a widow of the society of London (interpreted imperiously by Dame May Witty) and his creepy son (the ephemeral and annoying George Macready). Before she knows it, she wakes up to find herself in a seaside mansion she has never seen before, where Witty and Macready call her Marian and are trying to convince the servants and the people of nearby villages that she is the wife. crazy from Macready. Of course, this couple can only be planning unpleasant actions, and although we know that Julia finally has to escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis creates a real suspense by answering the question of how she will handle it. <br /> <br /> "My name is Julia Ross" has nothing stylistic to distinguish it from any number of films that came out in the same period, but I was surprised at how well it stayed together despite its budget of strings and his pedigree of films B. There are some moments that may have you on the edge of your seat, and I found myself really encouraging Julia when she realized the plan and began to outwit her captors. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine would have fainted, screamed and wavered, waiting for her hero to come and save her. So I can not tell you how refreshing it was for the heroine in this movie to use her brain and figure out how to save herself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
