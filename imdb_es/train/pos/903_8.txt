['I can honestly say that I never expected this movie to be good. I do not like family movies. I am far from being a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The director&#39;s last film (MPKDH) was completely stupid, and the music was very boring and soft, but there was Amrita Rao, who became my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There were also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher, who They are very Talents, so some more points. <br /><br /> I finally saw the movie and was very impressed. It brings us young MPK lovers with a hint of the HAHK wedding, and we have a winner. The outline of the story is similar to HAHK, cheerful at the beginning and serious at the end. The director also made a character with whom you could relate. What I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric. The casting adds to its perfection. Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance. This is an important improvement, and the most important thing is that it adapts to paper. The best is easily Amrita Rao. In fact, this is his best performance. His presence on the screen is so electrifying that he will love his performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, Anupam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are thrown terribly. No actor feels out of place. <br /><br /> The songs were quite disappointing, but they will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are beautiful ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also nice to watch. The songs are not colorful and danceable, and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, which will surely remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So, what was the flaw in the movie? The movie becomes quite slow, and the ending is quite stretched. But the film continues to advance at a good pace, which makes it a perfect family movie.']
