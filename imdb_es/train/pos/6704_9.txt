For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a gem hidden in TGIF (and later, in the early afternoon sessions of the school day). Each episode had a manic, maddening and fast pace that overcame the occasional uncomfortable jokes. Melissa Joan Hart exuded a great talent for physical comedy, particularly in her facial expressions. Her two aunts, playing "heterosexual men," or as heterosexual as the two witches could be, had a great comical and general chemical synch with Hart. Salem, like a talking cat, was free to engage in any crazy plan that interested him, and one could laugh and take it all in stride because, after all, he was a talking cat. Sabrina's friends completed the social experience at the school, which also included the typical "evil animator" and the "totalitarian principal". Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to fuse pop culture (for example, bands of the time, Jerry Springer), the archetypal human condition / morality (for example, the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas) and the literal Representation of such related metaphors in the Magic Kingdom. Unfortunately, like so many other programs throughout the television era, the program peaked during the first three years, which coincided with Sabrina's attendance at high school. Beginning in the fourth season, the transfer to the university marked what would become an abrupt decline in the overall quality of the program, particularly when the writers chose to present Josh as Harvey's rival, and invented minor excuses for Aunt Hilda. and Zelda remain on the screen as key players. The final season, where Sabrina works in a pop culture magazine, was unmistakably disappointing. Still, in the end, Sabrina (particularly in the high school years) remains a unique entry as a situational hybrid comedy with magical elements that elevates her above the tedious rate that occurs in this genre each year.
