I've had this film recorded for years and I started watching it again this morning (while waiting for my laundry, how ironic!), Mainly because I wanted to hear again the musical title of Benjamin Frankel. I ended up sitting for the first half hour, fascinated by how wonderfully assured are the direction, the writing and the performances. The film is like who is who of the 50 British characters: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont and, in particular, Ernest Thesiger, big as the old dried-out giant of textile factories. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not as protagonists of the characters, but as charming and charismatic guides. This is science fiction in its purest form and also a funny comedy. A classic of all times, and I hope no one tries to redo it!
