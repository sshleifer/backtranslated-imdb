I'm a pretty old guy, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coca Cola as they were 50-55 years ago, when all tastes for a child were fresh. I hope somehow I put something aside, then it is a magic suspended locker, to be able to try those things today. This magical cabinet could even have adjusted the tissue of the food to take into account how I have deviated, physically or not, a kind of chemical dynamics of expectations. Throughout the half century, they would have had to adjust a little, because they will see, they would have known that they had been left out. Eating one now would be a celebration of the self and the past, a story and a meaning that would almost make the intervening years an early reward. <br /> <br /> I did not have enough sense to do that with the original Coke. And could not he have invented one of those magic psychic lockers? Not then. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies, I really tuned in with Roman Polanski. Was it a strange and exotic pleasure? You know, movies smuggled out of the Soviet bloc. Films so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterwards. Movies that make you want to live with Polish women, one, and then decide that you would be the last to get them. <br /> <br /> This is what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and put it aside. I did not see it. I postponed until I thought it would be big enough to deserve it. Over the years, I would prove to myself, my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it. There are probably few Poles who have worked on this, practicing to deserve Chopin. Working to deserve femininity when I see it. Trying to remove the internal parts of the edges. <br /> <br /> Recently, I achieved something like the assurance that it was time to take this out. I already knew that the time had passed when this would work optimally, because I had already seen and understood "9th Gate". <br /> <br /> If you do not know, it is a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant (who is called the story) jumped out the window to die later after this man (played by Polanski) will visit. What happens is that time folds and becomes this woman. They deceive us by believing that he is simply angry. But the way we follow it, it is not. It simply has flashes that the world is normal and that the people around it are not part of a coven that distorts their reality. <br /> <br /> The story hardly matters. What matters is how Polanksi gives shape to this thing, both in the way the eye that only makes edges and in the body that only consists of confused flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that can torment me for the next 30 years. Is the idea on and inside and on without edges? Not at all, except a redhead wig. <br /> <br /> I do not know anyone else who can do this, this sketch that is still a sketch, this horror that is still natural. <br /> <br /> To understand the genius of this, you have to know one of the best movies ever made; "The back window." The genius of that film is the post-noir notion that the camera gives shape to the world; That the viewer believes the story. What Roman does is take this movie and turn it around. In Rear Window, the idea was that the on-screen viewer (Jimmy Stewart) was the presenter and everything else was fiction, woven as we saw it. Here, the inhabitant of the apartments on the screen is the filmmaker. We know this We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know that it is true that bodies change their identity, that times change, that causality is plastic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror, on that edge that imputes but never shows us and allows us to imagine. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of Ted - 4 of 3: Every alpha literate person must experience this.
