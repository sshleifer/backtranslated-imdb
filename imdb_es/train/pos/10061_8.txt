One of the most moving foreign films I've seen. <br /> <br /> The young woman is an incredible talent. Star performances by her (Doggie), the old man (the king of the masks) and Liang (the living Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The deplorable treatment of children, especially females, is worrisome. <Br /> <br /> I loved the music. The original Chinese dialogue increases the emotional intensity of the performances and the story. <br /> <br /> This is a family movie that MUST SEE, nice, although it is not for very young children. I would have rated the DVD release even higher if the soundtrack had been better transferred to the DVD and the transfer included the widescreen version.
