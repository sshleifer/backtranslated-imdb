Abu, THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from an evil sorcerer. <br /> <br /> While Europe was going to war and important parts of the world burned down, Sir Alexander Korda's London films unveiled this splendid escapist fare from the legends of The Arab Nights. Replete with swords and witchcraft, it gave audiences in 1940 a brief respite from the headlines. It is also a good cinematographic work, with good acting and an intelligent script. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt gets the maximum turnover and he deserves it, playing the evil wizard Jaffar. His saturnine face with his piercing eyes reminds us of the macabre roles he played with such pleasure during the days of silence. Here is a villain that is worth seeing. As the juvenile thief, Sabu is perfectly in this third film. Although he is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deeds and action. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast does a good job. John Justin is both energetic and sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of living in the most difficult way; Sabu gets an important part of the action (when he has not transformed into a dog) but Justin is athletic when needs have to. The lovely June Duprez plays the princess of Basra in danger of extinction, coveted by two very different men. Appearing at the end of the movie, the massive Rex Ingram shakes things up like a genius with an attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his good voice with a good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the infant Sultan of Basra, always trembling about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the screen and dialogue of the film). Elder Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of the Legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the double roles of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer. <br /> <br /> The movie started in Britain, but the difficulties during the war caused Korda to move her to Southern California. Which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction, in vibrant Technicolor, is the most attractive, especially the fairytale architecture in blues, whites and pinks. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> Born in Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu worked in the stables of the Maharaja of Mysore when it was discovered by the company of Korda and presented to the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were the best and he found himself working in Hollywood when they were finished. After a distinguished military service in World War II, he resumed his film career, but remained without limits for years playing ethnic roles in minor films not distinguished, being the only major exception BLACK NARCISSUS (1947). His last film, A TIGER WALKS (1964), by Walt Disney, was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years old.
