I saw it last night and I was surprised by the story line, the excellent development of the character and the good karmic environment that emanated from the performance and the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without revealing too much of the plot. , begins with an ordinary Joe who moves into his office work every day and is inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way, the protagonist and the varied characters he finds in his quest to be gentle on the dance floor learn about others and about themselves. <br /> <br /> The story has a prologue about what dance in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it's not as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the United States. <br /> <br /> The movie is cheerful; You will laugh out loud at some of the gags in sight. However, it is also worthy of a difficult way to describe. All the characters in the film are taken seriously, as they are, and none are reduced due to their "imperfections". <br /> <br /> I've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends. It happened that a friend lent me the video to learn to dance. Is this synchronous or what? I think so, because now I'm really geeky to try. <br /> <br /> Watch this wonderful family movie (young children may not catch it, but teenagers would certainly do it) and smile at the genuine care that is seen in it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Why They Would Make a Remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as it is.
