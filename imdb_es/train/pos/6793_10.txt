I absolutely love this game until death. Since I was 9 years old (now I'm 15). It has excellent graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and do not forget the incredible shapes of dragons! I'm still waiting for a remake, a prequel or a sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be a great hero. In this adventure you will meet wonderful creatures and fights with bosses. You also meet some friends along the way who have their own special element. Such as Fire, Darkness, Water / Ice, Thunder / Lightning, Earth, Light and Wind. There are also elements known as dragon spirits, which allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend. Dragons, magicians, creatures called fins and evil creatures that you will face in this adventure of emotion and emotion charged with action. One of my favorite games of all time, The Legend of Dragoon!
