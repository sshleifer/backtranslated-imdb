['I thought it was a great movie for children from 6 to 12 years old. A little sappy, but history is raising a new one. It shows that a teenager&#39;s dreams can come true. I think it&#39;s a great story for any child who feels bad, or feels like he&#39;s trying to juggle too many things between them. Very &#39;cute&#39; movie. Bravo.']
