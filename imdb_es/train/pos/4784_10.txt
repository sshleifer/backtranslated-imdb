It's good to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is as absolutely convincing as a simple and nice daughter of Robert Farnsworth, who finally, in his latest role, shows how good actor he was. It's hard to believe that this is a David Lynch movie. It is slow and uniform, sweet and moving. One of the best, unless you like car chases, sex scenes and violence.
