Interesting mix of comments to which it would be difficult to add something constructive. However, I will try. This was a very good action movie with some great pieces. You will notice that I specified the genre. I did not skimp on the lack of characterization, and I did not scold the performance. Enjoy it if for what it is people, an action movie well above the average. I could go on but I made my comment.
