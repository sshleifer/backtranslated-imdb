Personally, I love this movie and this novel (I read the book first and decided to watch the movie). First, the plot is truly original and unique. The performance is also great and I love the cast. Judd Crandall (plays Fred Gwynne) fits perfectly into his role and really sells it to you. There are also some cheesy lines thrown in there (Idk, if they're supposed to be cheesy), but they will really lighten the mood and provide a good laugh. The atmosphere of Maine is really a perfect place to film this movie and it attracts you throughout the movie. Not only will you love it, but you'll want to see it again and again. I recommend it 100% for any horror fan!
