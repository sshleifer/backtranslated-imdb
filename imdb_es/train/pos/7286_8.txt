I had a great time seeing this picture, and I was splendidly surprised by its more erudite characteristics. First of all, the film is undeniably cheap with its cardboard games, limited configurations and creative scientific elements. The performance ranges from very poor (the two strippers), barely professional (Herb Evers as the main man), gothic exaggeration (Leslie Daniels as Kurt's assistant) to first class with Virginia Leith in the lead role as the victim without a live head against his will for the benefit of science and the lustful passions of his fianc√©e. However, the scripts are very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this kind. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their limits should be. This movie is a thinking film in many ways. However, do not be fooled by your true intention. It is a poor quality story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to merge the head of his dead bride with the perfect body, thus creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of body and soul. Another very bright aspect of the film is the saxophone music that resonates strongly every time the doctor travels the city in search of female beauties.
