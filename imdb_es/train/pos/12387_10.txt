Of all the films of the seventies, none captured the true essence of the battle of good versus evil as did the Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were movies like El Exorcista, and others; But none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. If you have time, take a look. You may not be able to overcome obsolete devices as such, but this is a story worth taking into account. Then there are all the stars and the next stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what is happening as well. Pay a lot of attention. I had to see it four times to capture all the smaller strange claims, like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. In addition, the books are also very good. I only regret that they are not going to turn the second book into a movie. It's so scary that I would get over this movie.
