I am and I entertained a lot with the movie. It was my favorite film of all time in 1976. Growing up in the 70s, I was so enamored with the appearance and behavior of Kris Kristofferson, of course I'm not a film critic, but at the time I think it was very good. I really like the combo of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I've seen the movie many times and I still love the two of them like Esther and John Norman. I'm a big Kris fan and I see it in concert when I can. What a talented singer-songwriter, not to mention, an actor. I've seen it in many movies, but I still think of A star is Born.
