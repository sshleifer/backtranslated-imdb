['Legend of Zu <br /><br /> I remember well the original Zu Warriors of Tsui Hark made 18 years earlier. During a Christmas, in a rare week in which Channel 4 in the United Kingdom showed a week of Hong Kong movies, Zu Warriors was so exciting for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable, it was recorded in memory of an adult who has now been up sprog ... <br /><br /> In fact, I think the original Zu Warriors is one of the first movies I saw as a child and I can clearly remember the story and the action scenes. And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in his classic classic. <br /><br /> So when I saw this remake of Zu Warriors, there was a feeling of apprehension. Could it beat the memories of the dreamlike childhood I had from the original, or will it follow the path of other remakes and die a more horrible death than the bad ones and the broken necks found in those kung fu movies? <br /><br /> Well, the answer is that I can not say. But that was because this is not really a remake. The stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /><br /> The Legend of Zu tells the story of King Sky, a lone warrior, whose master, Dawn, declares his love for him, but a monster called insomnia takes his life. Two hundred years later, the insomnia returns, Dawn is reincarnated as Enigma and the insomnia has returned to destroy Zu. Meanwhile, White Eyebrows and Red try, with the help of King Sky, to stop the insomnia. <br /><br /> The plot is not full of twists and turns, but I had enough details to keep me interested. But I can see this movie as one you love or hate. The film has a lot to do with special effects, since most involve several computer-generated environments, such as The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this movie was one that did not exaggerate the graphics and everything was in good taste. Nothing seems rushed, unlike the hero. The funds were complementary to the performance and did not surpass the scenes at all. <br /><br /> The story also involves many characters and the mix of so many individuals makes the film intriguing. Possibly he was on the verge of &#39;too many cooks&#39;, but in general each character had his part in the story. But some of the roles seem to be &quot;extended cameos&quot; in my opinion, and somehow let me question a little the need for this. <br /><br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play central roles in the film, but I can not say that this film shows its best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems to have matured at least in her performance, but she is still quite raw. Kelly Lin was the new revelation for me. Despite its very short role, I apologize and I admit that they eat with their eyes! <br /><br /> In general, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed the &quot;original&quot;. Since both films are made by the legendary Tsui Hark, the two films together are part of a chronicle that shows how film production in Hong Kong has changed for two decades. And one beauty of that is the fact that you can not really compare the two movies, since apples are apples and pears are pears. <br /><br /> Ultimately, both are completely enjoyable movies in their own right. And I&#39;m going to remember again looking at the original again. <br /><br /> Two to see, but not to compare.']
