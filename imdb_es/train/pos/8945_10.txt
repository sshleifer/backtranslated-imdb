This is an honest attempt to make a spellbinding and sweet love story. The obvious inspiration behind the hit television series "Bewitched", this charming and sweet romantic comedy is a timeless treasure. The comparisons are obvious. Jimmy Stewart plays an unfortunate but stupid "straight". Kim Novac plays a voluptuous blonde witch who captures him by using a love spell. but when a stronger sorcerer breaks the spell, he is content with the duties of managing his own tent and is comforted by the fact that his beloved aunt is taking care of his beloved coat (his feline relative). You will recognize the aunt of "Murder by Death". This movie is funny and moving, with a spectacular wit and a nice witch feeling. Worth a look.
