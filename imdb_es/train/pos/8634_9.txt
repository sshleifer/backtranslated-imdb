LOVE AT THE TOP - the totally wrong American title for the magnificent French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (which means, I think, The Rabid Sheep) - is such an original film, the fact that it goes back to 1974 seems to be everything more amazing. This movie was far ahead of its time; Even with the highest standards of today, it achieves things that look rich and new. Filmed by the greatly underestimated director Michel Deville, it rather challenges the description in the way it combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire into a totally original mix, leaving a great but subtle surprise to make all that It has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable. The cast is splendid, I dedicate myself to writing and to the subject. But it is the delicious tone of Deville, which keeps him constantly unbalanced but that is prolonged, which leads to this "lost" movie at a very high level. (The written interview with the director in the "Special Features" section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have time).
