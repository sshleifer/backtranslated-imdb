This slippery and gritty film delivers constantly. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underestimated films and is easily Elmore Leonard's best adaptation to date (and if you're scratching your head thinking "but I loved RECEIVING", you should get a punch in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the "feel" of Leonard's characters better than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the history of Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) raises the sordid factor of history to astounding heights. Be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. For reference, my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer movies include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a really special place in my cold movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
