These are one of the films that do not require any thought or thought, it is a very funny time pass that was forgotten in the next hour. I was very surprised by the fact that John Abraham acted, he usually plays a gangster as a character with a face devoid of emotion, so it happens to be the opposite and does it successfully, managing to shine among the comic book geniuses as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also quite surprised with the 3 girls of Akshaye because the roles do not require much talent, but mostly complain about the disappearance of Akshaye (for the other girls), I was surprised when they managed to establish a real personality and could differentiate between them . One good thing, also most of the songs are good, it's colorful and fun, so on a boring Sunday night, this will cheer up your mood.
