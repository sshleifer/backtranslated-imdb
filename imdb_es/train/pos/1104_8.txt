['The movie begins with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) telling a story about how his best friend, the client, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are heavily grouped in a small apartment in New York, without enough closet space and Too many few bathrooms. When Jim&#39;s wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, advertising executive Jim falls in love (or falls in love with) an advertisement for a house. Once you bought the house, the bills and frustration pile up incessantly, since everything that can go wrong with the construction of Jim&#39;s &quot;dream house&quot; goes awry. <br /><br /> One of the three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a small and charming comedy, not very demanding, without a great real message, but an excellent way to spend an hour or two. The laughter is there from the beginning, when the alarm goes off and Jim tries to turn it off, and Muriel frustrates him at every step. The moment and the delivery of comic lines and situations can only be provided by a couple of experienced professionals, and that is just what Grant and Loy provide us with: refined performances, simple chemistry and lots of fun. Myrna Loy is in a rather ungrateful role (it is clear that Jim, the character of Grant, has the best part of the lines and acting, and Grant, as always, achieves both with a remarkable aplomb), but gives Muriel a color, life and bite That only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas also plays ironic fun to perfection, never hitting a single wrong note. <br /><br /> One of my favorite scenes definitely has to be when Bill stays locked in the &#39;warehouse&#39;, and Jim is going to &#39;save&#39; him ... just so everyone is trapped inside! All the little problems that arise for the Blandings renovation project, including petty jealousy and a &#39;Wham&#39; advertising campaign, seem to bring everything that * could * go wrong with the construction of a new house, but it makes it credible and a nice watch. . 8/10']
