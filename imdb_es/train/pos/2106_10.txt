Would those more romantic comedies be as skilfully executed as this one? I never thought that something as mundane as simply selling a music box could leave me breathless with emotion. Margaret Sullavan is a wonderful seller, and she and James Stewart always brought out the best in everyone. This film shows what I think is the most winning performance of Frank Morgan, and with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" to his credit, that's a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner companion left me dizzy with joy. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought that "Trouble In Paradise" was his favorite, but this must surely be a triumph. With some of the most ingenious dialogues, American films of the 30s have to offer.
