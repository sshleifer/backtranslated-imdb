['First, consider that this movie is almost fifty years old! However, it remains one of the best movies of all time. I wonder how many of the disposable celluloid productions of today will be spoken in 2050. <br /><br /> The story is simple, but solid enough and the effects are not less than phenomenal for the day. I can still remember the first time I saw this, as a child, when the monster enters the force field that protects the ship and you have to see its outline for the first time (and only). It made me tremble with fear, I can tell you. It seems dated today, but still effective enough. <br /><br /> The scenes with the tiger show their age now. You can see the outline where the tiger became entangled in the shots with Altaira, but they are only visible. <br /><br /> In the same way, the effect by which the creature makes its way through the Krell doors is done wonderfully. <br /><br /> It is also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (best remembered for the Airplane and Naked Gun movies) as a young man, but still mature. I was 30 years old when this movie came out! Almost 80 now! <br /><br /> In general, a good movie that will surely remain one of the favorites for the next few years. Eternal.']
