I just watched "The Last Wave" at my school's fine arts library. It is intriguing, like all things Peter Weir, but it is not always as flashy as I would have liked. I was fascinated by the ideas that were thrown at me (because the director of the film, Weir) handled them very well, but at the same time they did not stimulate me enough. AKA I got a little bored in some places. <br /> <br /> The plot surrounds an Australian lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has that links him to a group of aborigines he is defending. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense weather sequence and has some very impressive mood effects on everything (especially the strange and "belching" sound design) and a strong direction; but he just did not entertain me like Weir's later films do. Although I might need to see it again. <br /> <br /> Good movie about obsession and mystery. Because, in the end, the mystery that exists between whites and aborigines offers some very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> God bless Peter Weir, however. For him it's only worth watching this movie ... very organic director. As an Australian response, Malick! I would give you a 7 because you have enough great ideas to get over your boring moments.
