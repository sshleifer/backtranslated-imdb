Short, but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild trip to see. One day, I was just looking through my anime section on my order list and found it, and decided to watch it. I spent the entire time basically sitting with my mouth open. All the time I was empty of thoughts, or I had a fleeting one that shouted "Turn it OFF!". But I did not. And actually, I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> The animation is impressive. Very artistic, strange and dark. Personally I loved the incredible animation, but the apparently empty story behind it is equally compelling to me. <br /> <br /> A child, well, cat, goes in search of his sister's soul. In the first part, she is sick in bed, and soon she is paid for a visit from a kind of grim reaper. Your soul is divided in half. One is recovered by the cat child while the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> Then, the rest of the movie is a bit lost for me, honestly. I hope they come back, and their world ... maybe it's slowly crumbling? Perhaps his soullessness is the answer behind this, since the rest of the film contains several stages in which the world is in. First there is a giant flood, and then it dries in a desolate desert, and then everything freezes (thanks to anyone What is God or destiny, as you will see?) So I think they find the soul of the sister in the form of an orange flower After that, the whole world disappears ... Haha, I did not understand that, but it gives me chills every time. <br /> <br /> Despite seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there's a deeper message if You look at it enough and you do some research Personally, I LOVE trippy things like this, and I'd love to spend time doing that just to understand it But for some people it's probably not your cup of tea It's presented as very unsettling what if you like your direct anime, this is not a movie for you, however, if you have an open mind, I recommend this movie.
