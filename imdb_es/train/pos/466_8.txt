This was an extremely good historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as the tortured genius of Luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character's maniacal affectations, such as his strange dance. Emily Watson is well in her supporting role as the sensitive mistress Natalia. <br /> <br /> The relationship between chess and close madness is well explored by Gorris and Nabokov's family concerns as "eternal innocence" (ie, "Lolita") are evident in this film. I think now I'm going to read the novel. It was a touching and tragic ending and it was difficult to keep a dry eye. Brilliant movie!
