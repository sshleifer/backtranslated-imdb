In a way, this movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash." Remember Whoopi Goldberg on the shredding machine? Whoopi zonked out tranquilizers? Whoopi as Blind Lemon and imitating Mick Jagger? Great moments captured in the movie for sure, but the movie is still a bit horrible, right? This is how I feel about "Rich In Love." A man hears his wife sing for the first time. Postcoital adolescents talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream from a bucket and, in another scene, has a lovely moment to wake up regarding his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to his wardrobe. But here there is only the whisper of a plot and you can not wait for it to start moving. Only when the image of The Graces of Charlotte Caffey of Go-Gos accelerates a great pop song, the image wakes up ... and then it's over! <br /> <br /> This image is the equivalent of a lazy summer day in The Deep South American.
