When I saw this show for the first time, I found it interesting. I saw it, I saw it revolve around Sarah, as the character sees the world ... around her. I understood, but I was not laughing a lot. <br /> <br /> On stage and in his program, he is racist, coarse, insensitive and very self-centered. I did not get it at the beginning, and I took everything at face value. Then I could watch his movie, Jesus is Magic. I think that served as the basis for Sarah Silverman, explaining what "language" she is talking about. She is like Marilyn Manson, who works hard to show us horrible ideas and images, but in the end you realize that it is not an assault, it is an affirmation. And once you understand that, you're glad that someone is finally giving it to you directly. <br /> <br /> I do not want to suggest that only smart people will understand, or that to hate this show is to prove it. your idiocy While I like many 'smart' shows, to this day I do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I get the impression that it's good, but I do not get it. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman Program, but I'm glad it has finally appeared. <br /> <br /> The creators of this program work hard, all the episodes are loaded not only with dialogue and argument, but with Songs, or dream sequences, production numbers. These people are not putting together something to fill a space of time and, please, the advertisers, seem to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. If I had to predict the future of this program, I would say that it will follow the path of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled before it's time and it will stay alive in the hearts of fans and on DVD. But do not be discouraged, creators of SSP, your audience IS out there, and we will be watching while you are allowed to do the show.
