Vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. Who could ask for more? Moon Child delivers everything in a well packaged movie! Gackt is the innocent Sho, who befriends a Vampire Kei (HYDE), their relationship grows over time, but as Sho ages, Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It does not help that both fall in love with the same woman. The special effects are pretty good considering the small budget. It is a mature touching story of human emotions. You will laugh, you will cry, you will laugh, then you will cry a little more. Even if you're not a fan of your music, SEE THIS MOVIE. It works very well as an independent vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
