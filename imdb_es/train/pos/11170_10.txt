There is something about Pet Sematary that I never felt anywhere else. Maybe the fact that I was a child when I first saw it made this experience so memorable. But as I look at it again and again, it never gets old and I never get bored. From the opening credits with that spooky song to the very chaotic ending, there's something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, and it's still playing in your head: sometimes dead is better! <br /> <br /> I do not think it's useful to retell the whole story. All you need to know is that it starts from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and drowns step by step to point B (which is, believe me, the end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are great, and Pet Sematary is the last place on earth I would be. Like I said, sometimes dead is better!
