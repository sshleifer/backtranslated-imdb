['Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, is a fun camp horror comedy, in which the fourth wall breaks a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the navel. And the breasts of Cassandra Peterson become a character of their own. <br /><br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the host of the stacked terror program, which learns that she has inherited her aunt Morgana. So she goes to a small town in Fallwell, which is ruled by the most horrible monster that has ever embraced the earth: the community of morality. The boobacious appearance of Elviras is, of course, too much for plums, but city children enjoy their different approach to life. And, of course, there is an even more sinister evil, his uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is behind the spellbook of Elvira&#39;s mothers. Look, Elvira is really a real witch, she just does not know it. Still. <br /><br /> For what it is, Elvira is a pretty funny movie, even though the script leaves a lot of room for improvement. Most of the laughter comes from the difference between Elvira and people of good morals, but there are also a couple of good visual gags. Over all directions it&#39;s fine, but it never rises to be more than that. In short, a good comedy intentionally countryside. If you like this kind of thing, that&#39;s it.']
