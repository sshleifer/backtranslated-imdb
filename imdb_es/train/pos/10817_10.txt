Well, this movie was probably one of the funniest horror movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad that you just have to laugh, and the performance, well, let's say it's not mel gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays a police officer, is so bad that he becomes good. I do not know how, but he himself makes this movie a 10. You must see it if you are in horror / slash movies because they are bloody and funny at the same time. Killer movie.
