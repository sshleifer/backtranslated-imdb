This movie scared me so much! I have to admit that I spent most of the movie looking through my fingers, but what I saw was really scary. I screamed out loud two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> As for taking pictures, my favorite aspects were sound and photography. The sound was particularly good and the stage was really beautiful and spooky. I read somewhere that it's a strange team of husband and wife who did it. For some reason that makes this even stranger to me. <br /> <br /> If you like the jumps and the anxieties of horror movies, then this is for you! Very exciting and an excellent movie to rent with a group of friends who love watching movies crouched on a couch screaming like little girls.
