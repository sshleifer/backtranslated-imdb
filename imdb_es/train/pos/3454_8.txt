First of all, I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake obsessed with making him look good, in fact, I'm not even a big fan of Justin, but I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I work in a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I had never heard of, I had to see what it was about. I did not think that Justin's performance was so bad, it was clearly the worst of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, since Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott are two names that are not even part of the first list of credits. The story is basic, a journalist who discovers corrupt cops, but I found it well done. The character of L L Cool J was clearly in conflict, but I honestly did not know what I would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is, as always, the wise mentor figure who does it so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, it was like he was there. HI's character did not have much substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can not do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought that Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. Really believable and really of character, it scared me a couple of times. <br /> <br /> I really expected a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Horrible phrases, unjustified action sequences, things like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I did not find any of that. Each shot had a point, it was not a clich√©, it was really solid. <br /> <br /> in general, an incredible cast, a decent story that kept me interested and enough action to make me jump. I do not know why it did not appear in the theaters, it was better than a bit of garbage I've seen on the big screen. I would say it's worth seeing.
