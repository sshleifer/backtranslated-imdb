** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I liked this game a lot. I got it for Christmas after two months of giving clues to my parents. I am happy to have done it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the only player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you're at a party in London, and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter. Of course you have to rescue her, and it's a pretty big level, but you should probably take at least five minutes. The best part, and I think the most fun part, is when you're in the jet-pack, and people are rapping at Big Ben. Simply equip the most reliable rocket launcher on the plane and destroy the faces of the clock and defeat the enemies. Pure fun! <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are very good, but quite short. There are four mini levels that you can unlock, and that's one of the disappointments, because only the first two are really fun, and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' targets, I mean, c' Lun! We have many points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> The multiplayer, me and some of my friends agree, it's very good and challenging, even if there are no bots Halo did not have bots, but that's still a good multiplayer game! You can be a bunch of bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way to kill people without having to see their character. <br /> <br /> Game - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is an odd bad graph, but that is not extremely frequent). Multiplayer: 10/10 (no comments, just great, you can drive in backpacks and vehicles). Sound: 8/10 Playback value: 7/10 (the only levels I return to are the Loondon level and the Istanbul 1 part). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> It could have a bit of improvement, but it's still good.
