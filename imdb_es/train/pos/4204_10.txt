And anyone who sees this movie will agree. This film was directed in the days when the plot, the credibility of the character and the subject really mattered. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter steal attention. Ritter is in top form as an informant "Moe", she survives in the Bowery section of New York, acting like a dove for the New York police. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I've seen Peters in is "Niagara," and it certainly demonstrates his ability to act here, complete with a Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately threatening, since the antihero must discern what is right, despite his need for cash. <br /> <br /> The photography is brilliant. The neon, the subway station (although it looks cleaner than the real thing!), The harbor shack where Widmark lives as a passer-by. It makes an excellent use of the city, with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; The political climate of the time is a disturbing backdrop. 10/10.
