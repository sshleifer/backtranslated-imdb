While filming at a site in the Florida National Guard, "Tigerland" totally reminded me of Fort Polk, LA, firing ranges, maneuvering areas, waist-deep water and all. The film was quite authentic and the characters similar to the same in my AIT in 1974. The difference between the year of Tigerland, 1971 and mine of 1974 is that all the sergeants and instructors knew that they would not return to Vietnam, since it was practically everything, so the training was very relaxed, it was not a challenge at all. That was the forerunner of all our problems in the 70s and 80s, which I know for sure when I stayed until 2004. I never heard anyone mention "Tigerland", but the Army did have realistic training villages in Vietnam in different bases in the United States. Vietnam veterans tell me that until 1972 Basic & AIT could be quite tough and tough, because the coaches had been there and had the mandate to train men traveling to Vietnam with the skills necessary to achieve it, although it was not always so . Both a drill sergeant in Polk and then one of my NCOs from Vietnam veterans, when we had become instructors in a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, told me there was nothing they could do to prepare anyone and that people just I had to discover and decipher it. for themselves. This movie has a high rate.
