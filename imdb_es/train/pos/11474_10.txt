This movie is one for the ages. First, I have to say that after seeing this once, it became one of my favorite movies of all time. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) has created a true work of art. Where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertaining, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us the reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. Most of the media rotates and turns, but Ben Coccio comes face to face with school shootings, able to go where no other means of media has gone before, to the minds and hearts of two young people who plan kill your classmates. While it is surely graphic and horrifying, how could it not be? The gloves are removed, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters are put aside and lead us to a place where we can find the truth in what happened. Sometimes it is not just a loose screw as we all like to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, they are more human, we are shown that these children are us and ourselves. Society left them behind and the consequences are horrible and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your neighbor. A lesson that we all must learn, thank you very much for making this film, Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you continue with your film career.
