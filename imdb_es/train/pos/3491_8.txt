The cast is excellent, the good acting, the interesting plot, the evolution full of suspense ... but it is difficult to put all those elements in a film that lasts barely 80 minutes. If it took more time to develop the plot and the subplots, it would have a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of substance would have made this a very good movie instead of a good movie.
