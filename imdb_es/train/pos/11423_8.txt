This film shows life in northern Cameroon from the perspective of a young French woman, France Dalens, whose father is an official of the colonial government (French), and whose family is one of the few white families. It gives an idea of ​​what life was like for both the settlers and the natives with whom they related. It's a sense consistent with another film I've seen about Africa in a similar period of time (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression, things happen in the movie, but the plot is discreet. The viewer is allowed to draw their own conclusions instead of the filmmakers being forced, although the framing of the story as a reminder of the visit of the woman to the south-west of Cameroon as an adult offers some perspective.
