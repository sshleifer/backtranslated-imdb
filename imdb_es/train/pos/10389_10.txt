I saw this movie when I was a child. It left me impressed. This was before the days of television, so a movie of this magnitude could send a child into orbit. It impressed me so much that I went to see this film for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at this time were far ahead of their time. Sabu was a true delight, just like Rex Ingram as the Genius. I found myself singing "I want to be a sailor" for months after the film left the city. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was a character as villain as you would always want to know. Also, June Duprez was never more beautiful than her in this photo. The color was exceptional. Give this movie an AAA!
