I just can not agree with the previous comment: there are many interesting and incredible filmic images in this case, it has an unusual structure and moves well into a frightening climate sequence that is notable for its effective use of silence. What's more, it explores the strange impulse of suicide in a very frank way, does not make any effort for what it shows, but does not dwell on or sensationalize the subject. has clues of both documentaries and horror and art cinema, and deserves a place among the canon of "different" horror films such as The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (both earlier and that could well be an influence not recognized in) . Definitely worth seeing if you are interested in the limits of horror movies.
