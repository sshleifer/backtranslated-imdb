Pinjar of Mr dwivedi is an awesome movie. It is definitely the best and the best of 2003. There are very good performances in it. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila. She is like you've never seen her before. A real great performance. Along with her is an excellent actor, Manoj bajpai, who has shown Bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) who lives in Pakistan before the partition. She is from a Punjabi family that lives in a small town. She was abducted by a Muslim man as part of a fight with the Punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns, since the arranged marriage of Urmila is due in a few days. This movie is really a very good movie. The story is solid with an incredible script. all the performances like lillete dubey, isha koppikar (you will not believe, but she can also act in addition to jus dancin in Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. those sets with previous partition pakistan, costumes, cinematography, sound, background score add to the positive points. From the beginning to the end, you stayed in your seat with the next question. This movie is not worth watching, but it deserves to be part of his movie collection. The final scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest to all those No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-Gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai crowd to see this amazing movie. My rating: 10/10.
