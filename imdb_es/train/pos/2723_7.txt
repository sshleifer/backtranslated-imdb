Richard Brooks masterfully manages and adapts IN COLD BLOOD. However, he is also so determined to be realistic, that he is sometimes more clinical than entertaining. In recounting the brutal murder of a Midwestern family, author Truman Capote focused on the minutiae, wrapping himself and the reader in the theme AND the issues! Brooks savagely moves away from that approach in favor of something closer to the docudrama. Although he films in real places, he keeps his distance. The murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles, which surely they were. They are not seen as misunderstood souls (as in Capote's book) and the savagery of their act is terribly blunt. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as assassins, as is the support cast, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as the reporter (the "character" of Capote?) The reference photograph is of the great Conrad Hall.
