['Obviously, a film that has had a great influence not only in the genre of friends but also in the action genre. George Lucas had to be a fan of this movie since much of his Star Wars series looks like a tribute to Gunga Din. The characters who play Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks are just precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffe&#39;s Gunga Din was transformed into C-3PO and R2-D2 and like it or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /><br /> Today, this film looks like no PC, but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru, the leader of the Indian opposition to the British raj that could be repeated in the feelings of many today. <br /><br /> For a child this was a great movie. Three strong masculine protagonists and only a touch of romance. There was a time when young people who considered kissing the girl in the Saturday morning movie were simple paps. Not like today when the skin is greeted with delight. Too late to regret the lost innocence. <br /><br /> Hopefully this movie will not be forgotten and some of those who surf the channel will stop at TCM and watch a movie with action, adventure and a cast of thousands instead of CGI actors.']
