This movie is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. Like any Panahi movie, it was a very realistic drama that represents the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy. But it was very Funny; much lighter than the dark and serious director The Circle (my favorite Iranian film). The inventiveness of the girls and the jokes between them and the soldiers were completely credible (as if they were a documentary) and completely funny. <br /> <br /> The filming of the coincidence and the consequences were surprising. He added a realism very similar to Kenny from Australia, of course, a very different movie. <br /> <br /> The performances of all non-professional actors? soldiers and girls ?? They were very credible. It was very exciting to see the passion, disappointment and emotion of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks that Muslim girls who wear a chador are different from their own daughters, should they go see this movie? It will be a true revelation. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers represented the current paradigm. They started with the official standard policy responses to all the girls' pleas. As the film progressed, they found it increasingly difficult to maintain this position. When it seems that all Tehran bursts into a wild celebration, everyone is trapped in it, and the ridiculousness of current policies is obvious to all. <br /> <br /> It was a very touching and unexpected ending. , and gave the film a very good mix of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although it is a cinema for adults, I think that mature children of approximately seven years will really appreciate this movie (as long as they can read the subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that a repressive country like Iran is capable of doing so. It produces movies of such quality by people like Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the restrictions there force directors to be extremely resourceful. Australian filmmakers (and others) could take a page out of their book.
