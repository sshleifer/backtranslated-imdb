Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress to easily talk about her father in a small mining town. He also sells it to men. She escapes to New York and, literally, sleeps to the top. <br /> <br /> Originally, I had only seen the 71-minute version, but it's pretty extreme, for the time being. Nowadays it is quite docile. The movie moves very fast and has tons of sexual innuendo, some of which turn out to be pretty silly (but fun) today. He moves so fast that he can easily ignore that most could never happen, even in 1933. There is nothing classic or monumental in this, it's just a quick little movie and gleefully dirty that is very funny. In the end, it only collapses with a small "moral" ending demanded by the censors. He is presented as incredible and stupid (I saw him in a theater and the audience laughed at him, a man rightly said "No way"). I just saw the uncut version of 75 minutes that has a different version, something tragic and MUCH better. ending. It was thought that this version was lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake! I think this is the only one in launch, but be careful. <br /> <br /> The acting is good: Stanwyck gets into his role and does it VERY WELL. Makes you believe that he likes to be cruel and sleep. There are also strong supporting performances by the handsome Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for a pre-stardom John Stardom in a fun moment as a gentle and kind office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give this a 9.
