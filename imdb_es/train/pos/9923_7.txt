I read several reviews and several of them destroyed the movie. I was originally interested in this project because I was being directed by Tony Scott and I became very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a profound impact on me. Before I begin my review, first let me say this ... it is wonderful to see that this film could have been told in a boring and ordinary way, however, the writers and Scott chose a different approach. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it's not boring. Most Hollywood films offer proven and true arguments that they know will connect with people, which often guarantees the acceptance of the film by the public and creates a greater likelihood of profit. This plot was one of the most interesting I had seen in a long time. Just for reference, I recently saw 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and, while I will say that these films are excellent and I enjoyed them tremendously, the two plots of these films are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to they will say They do not take any risks at all, and they are extremely predictable after having seen a good amount of American films. The plot of Domino is interesting and told in a way that makes you think, "oh man, now they're screwed". And I feel that it has been missing in many recent films. In my opinion, it has a lot of depth and offers many questions to question it while looking at it. In general, this is what kept me so interested in the movie. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt that the characters were accurate. Knightley did a wonderful job portraying a beautiful woman, who had nothing inside and wanted to be seen as what she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove her worth and took all the means she had to achieve that. <br /> <br /> Choco was also very credible, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to Domino's lack of affection, as well as his jealousy issues within the team ... they all sounded to me, which It made me feel that his character was much more realistic. <br /> <br /> The character of Rourke was the least interesting to me, but he still sounded faithful to me. He seemed like a normal guy, trying to survive. I hope that's what the filmmakers tried to achieve with him because that's what I got. He did a very good job of showing Ed in a way that Joe has made his mistakes, but he's still trying to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I think they gave me the heart I so badly needed. 'to the history. It was not just people who were getting money to buy a Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem and were looking for others with the intention of achieving that goal. You could empathize with them because, for them, this child's illness was a problem without any other solution. These characters were supposed to show real less fortunate people who got into this mess because they needed help. <br /> <br /> The mobsters: they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mafia can. And I really liked that part. They also completed the story with small complexities that made the plot much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken Boys / 90210: <br /> <br /> They provided the comic relief in a movie that would otherwise be very serious. From the awkward statements of Walken to the incessant references that the 90210 boys have been holders. His participation in the film only made it much more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... cinematography. This is where this movie seems to have lost many potential fans. But in my opinion, I thought it was great, in my opinion, the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective. I considered it a method that was done correctly, but I could always use improvements, like anything else. I applaud and congratulate Scott, the editor, the director of photography and the cinematographer for taking a risk with this film. Not only were they very far with their presentation, but they went much further. The use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark, provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and dirty look that accurately depicted the life of the mafia, the bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a way that shows that their lives It's not 'as peachy or' clean 'as all the others. If you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks, if any. This shows that Scott and his team tried to achieve something with this aspect and did not do it for the fun of it. I realize that most of the people who watched this movie did not expect it and that many of them stayed in this movie, but I think it was great that Scott has adopted this approach. Hollywood movies have become predictable and bland. Most of them are triggered in the same way with the same twists and turns. And I'm glad that Scott tried to do something different. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is not for everyone, but to say that it is garbage and has nothing to offer. I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I spent the money on it. I would recommend this to everyone, but I'm sure he'll only play a chord with a few. I must agree with a previous poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'MTV sphere' will not appreciate this movie, but I think a lot of people do. We should all try to enjoy it because of the fact that Scott and company. He took a risk and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. And with that in mind, I think it had tremendous success.
