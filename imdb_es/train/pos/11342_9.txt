I used to see Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 years old. It was right after Bay City Rollers. One day I saw him arrive at Family Channel and I recorded it for my three-year-old daughter. I had forgotten all the things I loved as a child, the magic flute, the zoom broom, Witcheepoo's makeup. <br /> <br /> This show is decidedly low tech. The mayor is surely a precedent for Mayor McCheese, and they are all a stuffed creature with annoying bulging eyes. But children love these things. Somehow, they would rather see a man work with a puppet sock than sit in front of a high-tech computer animation. There is slapstick (mild), but there are no topics for adults like sex or people who die, and children accept Jimmy's plans. The children think it would be good to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone that their house was on fire, and I loved that every time my daughter saw a jet of water in the sky I thought Witchypoo was flying overhead. The music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter loved it. She used to sing "different is difficult, different is only" in the car. My daughter saw this program at least once a day for approximately 5 months, and it is still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is being prepared. I really hope you try to keep the old flavor and do nothing like computer animated characters, etc. I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf.
