This is not "so bad that it's good", it's purely good! For those who do not understand why, you have the intellect of a four-year-old child (in response to a certain comment ...) Anyway, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you and a parody From me. It is the coolest text in film history. I have it and the three prequels that are on my DVD shelf next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It incorporates the recognition of the absurd and undermines everything that you or I call standard. I write scripts and this film, without help, opened a genre of comedy for me, as we have never seen. It can only be taken in portions ... it is a type of exploitation ... at this point, I only try to occupy the minimum of ten lines. My comment ended a while ago. Hopefully it works when I present it now.
