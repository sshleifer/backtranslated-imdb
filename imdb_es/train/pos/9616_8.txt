It is worth seeing twice because of the rapid causal changes between several convincing stories, "Bug" emerges as a completely satisfactory work of art that plays an always optimistic love against thousands of examples of frustrating reality. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch) whose primary concern for life, from that of a cockroach to the passengers of the airline for which he is partially responsible, frames the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable television technician with unlimited confidence in fortune cookie messages: "You'll meet the girl of your dreams." <br /> <br /> Against such optimism are the forces of peculiar reality, all generated by the actions of the characters: parking tickets, a clogged drain in a Chinese food store / donuts, television interruption, a squashed fender , a canceled dinner reservation that eventually results in the cancellation of a vacation in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun: Olive got drunk at a Chippendale presentation, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative trying to deal with an irate customer, Cyr (Brian Cox) obsessed with the germs that faced a restaurant inspector, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) reacted to his girlfriend's refusal to have children by writing hostile fortunes of Chinese cookies: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and the boy who falls asleep while attending a hammer tire because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's lost cat. <br /> <br /> A Short story with public cable. The access host (Darryl Theirse) and a local acting teacher who reads "The Boy in the Bubble" expresses the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Bug" is entertained almost at the same level as "Trains, planes and cars", but with a lower budget and a fresher eye.
