I really enjoyed this movie and it was a bit difficult to do it when your brother is making stupid comments on it every 30 seconds. But I enjoyed this movie, mainly because I'm used to the usual HK action movies. Most movies like this do not see it in the story line, they see it as meaningless action. And the action without sense is correct. You can see Jet Li jump, spin, kick, hit, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. It is true that this movie was released to a wider audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4. That is one of the reasons why the ratings for this movie fell. Most people probably expected to see a film as polished as an American movie. But you have to remember that most of HK's movie budgets are not as high as those of an American movie, and the style in an HK action movie is often very different and usually requires a lot of work in many of them. If you want to see a good action movie, you should see this. Try to ignore the dubbing. <br /> <br /> My rating was an 8.
