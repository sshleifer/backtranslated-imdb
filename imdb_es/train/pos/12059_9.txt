I love ghost stories in general, but in particular I love the stories of British ghosts, cold, atmospheric and elegantly spooky. This qualifies in all charges. A young and naive lawyer ("lawyer" in Britspeak) is sent to a small town near the coast to settle the estate of a deceased old woman. It's the 1920s, a time when many middle-class Britons go on vacation by the sea for "their health." Well, guess what, there's nothing "healthy" in the town of Crythin Gifford, the creepy place of the old Victoria's huge and victorious hacienda, which sits on the banks of a salt marsh shrouded in mist. When the lawyer saves the life of a little girl (none of the locals will help the tot in danger of extinction: you discover why later in the film), involuntarily incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. She is not a hairy ghost, but a solid black silhouette of malice and malice. The viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malevolent presence in each frame. As the camera approaches the lawyer while reading the legal documents, he expects to see the woman in black at any time. When the lawyer comes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity in the creepy old house, the camera catches him and you think she'll appear there too. Waiting for the woman in black to appear is exciting. We have seen many elements of this story before (the locked room in which nobody enters, the fog, the naive stranger who ignores the warnings of the locals), but the director somehow manages to combine them all in a completely new ghost and of implacable appearance. history. Look at it with a friend so you can have someone warm to hold on while you wait for the woman in black. . .
