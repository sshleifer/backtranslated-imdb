This film is a moving story about an adventure taken by Darius Weems, 15 years old. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a disease not yet curable that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the leading cause of death of babies in the United States. He and a few close friends travel across the country to Los Angeles with the goal of customizing his wheelchair on MTV's, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The trip begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The gang heads west for a trip that all participants will never forget. Darius gets on a boat for the first time, travels in a hot air balloon, swims in the ocean and visits places he always wanted to see, such as the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material. They do not earn money with sales of the $ 20 dvds. $ 17 goes to investigate the disease and $ 3 goes to make more copies. The film has won more than 25 awards at festivals and I agree with the quote given to the Variety movie, "Certain to stir hearts."
