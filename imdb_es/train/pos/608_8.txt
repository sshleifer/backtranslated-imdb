Seeing this movie, I was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> Little did I know that I was on a journey through cinematic magic. Everything in the film, from the plot to the dialogue to the effects, was very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines like the star she is in this movie. From beginning to end, you fall more and more in love with this character. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is threatening like an evil witch who insists on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is an adorable character who gives the audience the greatest comic relief as the film is gaining momentum towards climax. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a movie that surprised me and delighted me as a movie fan. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that is fun for children and adults alike, Stardust is the way to go.
