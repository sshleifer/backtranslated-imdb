Before watching this movie, I had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the movie, but listening to it was not for me, so I planned to see it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make up an interesting group of people who are determined to go canoeing on the Cahulawassee River and in the unfortunate series of events that occur in all of them. The development of the character takes a while to involve the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys as if they were your friends. The acting, the dialogue is very real, the closest thing to the reality that can be obtained for the performance of Hollywood. The character of Reynolds "Lewis" was interesting as a boy who gets very strong but under the male appearance lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed by his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the character that stands out the most, the Unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him in every corner really mold him and make him a different man at the end (his character transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really look like stupid fools who like to joke and do not seem to get too serious unless they do too, and they did ... I was really surprised by Director Boorman's vision of Dickey's novel. very impressed. You can not spend your whole life without seeing this movie. I give him eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.
