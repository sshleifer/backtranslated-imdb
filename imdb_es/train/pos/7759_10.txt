On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a spooky and brilliant telenovela about the sexual dysfunctions of a Texas oil family. But underneath all of this there is a deep social commentary on 1950's life. Director Douglas Sirk re-scores with another Univeral sudser. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Rock Hudson, Stack's best friend, loves her too. When Stack discovers that he is sterile and Bacall ends up pregnant, the fireworks fly. And, the very good Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her portrait of the biggest nympho in Texas that is rejected by Hudson. Good epic telenovela.
