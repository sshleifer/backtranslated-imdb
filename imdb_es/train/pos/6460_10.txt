If the scriptwriter and the director had the intention of opening hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with their music, they succeeded with me. The common human situations became original, personal and immediate, so I personally felt moved by each situation. I think I would give credit to the power of music combined with the point of view of the person who writes the film. Without spoiling me, I can say that I was very touched by the way he lived the movie. Have not you really cried what joy? empathy? just deep emotion? in a very long time. I would love to find a way to show it to others. I saw it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
