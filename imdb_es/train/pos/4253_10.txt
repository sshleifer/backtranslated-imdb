Really excellent movie, one of the best I've seen. Touch and simple: like life, sometimes you cry, sometimes you laugh and it's just beautiful. Not much of anything, just as it is supposed to be. I really loved the idea of ​​the film, nobody is bad or good, all or only people, sometimes make mistakes mainly due to the pressure of society, all try to be strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that they do it Have reasons to get angry: you can do it, but eventually the anger disappears and then you must let the love come back, even if it is difficult, there is true happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actors and cast, the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> nice nice nice <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing it, especially if you like to see the life of the Italians ...
