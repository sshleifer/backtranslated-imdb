For starters, I loved the göta kanal 1, had many classic jokes, including the unfortunate boy from the canoe who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, still acting like the same guy in the göta kanal 2 Movie, but in My opinion, performance is not as fun as it was in the first movie, in fact, you do not notice it much. One thing that made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats, in this film there are only racing boats, they are sure fast, but they do not make waves like the big floating mansions used in the first movie, I liked the old ones better and these new boats make one of the last scenes seem ridiculous when the man in the canoe suddenly jumps out of it to avoid the "big waves" of those small fast boats. Truly one less. You have to accept that we are no longer living in the same Sweden as in 1974. This film also contains a bit more violence than the first one. Although the movie was great in general. I just concentrated on some disadvantages that disappointed me, but the rest of the movie lived up to my expectations, so go see it! It is well worth the money.
