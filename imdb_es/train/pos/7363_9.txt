This Is not A Love Song. <br /> <br /> My one word summary of this movie would be "Excellent". <br /> <br /> Is it probably not attractive to the mass audience? It's a movie <br /> <br /> that forces you to participate. Observe, think and ask. <br /> <br /> The comparisons could be made with Deliverance (Topic / Theme) and <br /> <br /> perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for the general filming style. <Br /> <br /> However, this movie is unique against both. <br /> <br /> Cinematic effects (solarization, freezing of frames, blur, etc.) <br /> <br /> have been seen before, but are used more effectively in this film <br /> <br /> to prop up the natural tension of the story. <br /> <br /> Acting is coarse, threatening and absolutely credible. <br /> <br /> The real theme of The movie is about friendship. The title really gives <br /> <br /> the distance game. Probably not the kind of friendship that most of the <br /> <br /> we have experienced or would like. <br /> <br /> It's a love song.
