So I do not ruin it for you, I'll be very brief. There is a great performance and funny lines from the attractive cast. A young graduate of Harvard Medical School (Brian White) discovers that he does not know as much as he thinks about people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida for his internship because a girlfriend (Mya) left him for a job as a television producer. His principal resident (Wood Harris), helped wonderfully by his "creative collaborator" (Zoe Saldana) brought him up to date. They help protect your career and show you the broader possibilities of being a compassionate doctor rather than a player who just wants to make money (as seems to be true for many of my previous medical friends).
