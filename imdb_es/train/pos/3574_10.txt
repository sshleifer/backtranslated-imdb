It's hard to say sometimes why exactly a movie is so effective. From the moment I came across "The Stone Boy", something told me it would be a great movie. Despite that, it seemed very unlikely that I would ever have the opportunity to see it for myself. Then, one day, while looking at the online catalog of my local library, I saw that they had recently purchased the DVD release of this movie. So I am extremely happy, because the cinematography is of an amazing depth and quality that an old copy of VHS could never replicate. <br /> <br /> And speaking of cinematography, I must point it out as far as possible. The most impressive aspect of this movie. As a photographer who pursues almost the exact visual style represented in "The Stone Boy," I am a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can take a movie almost without help. Here, he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast, and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs. But having Juan Ruiz Anch√≠a behind the camera makes practically all the scenes beautiful. And you can almost never say that. Most movies would never expect such a thing from you. Scene after scene captures some details, a bit of visual magic that leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> The director, Christopher Cain, has had a long and interesting career. As far as I can gather, this movie is not very representative of it. But, sometimes, to catch a director near the beginning of his career, before all the big budgets and the loss of focus, you can find a true subtle magic. Cain goes back in this movie, lets things happen with a life of their own, and then more and more. As in the first John Sayles films, the characters are given space to breathe, time to talk. Secondary stories happen just because, and that's life. Cain shows a remarkable, raw and even totally painful understanding of human nature in this film. <br /> <br /> The performance unites a large part of this story. When people talk, when they exist in this film, they do it as real people, not limited by the fact that they are playing characters. Gina Berriault's screenplay allows immensely talented and respected actors such as Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Frederic Forrest to spend time simply existing. Whether the things you have to say have a minor or profound importance, everything is reduced with the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> When you look at the actors involved or the great soundtrack by James Horner, it seems strange that such a film is almost forgotten. Perhaps much of what makes "The Stone Boy" is what was the period of time in which it was created. There is a hangover feeling in the 70s in this image that reminds me deeply of my own childhood. People talk about the 80s in terms of modern styles and music, but it is not in the 80s that I lived or remember. The appearance of the images, the discreet and dark quality of the performance, and the overall result must be put under the skin of anyone who has grown up in this age of time in or near North America. I see myself in this. I see how I saw the world. And a movie like "The Stone Boy" sees the world as it really is. <br /> <br /> For more of this sentiment, see: <br /> <br /> The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983), Places in the Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
