Narratives ?? Whether written, visual or poetic epics. In general, try to avoid the May characters too; Readers and viewers, after all, can be overwhelmed too easily by trying to track who exactly is who. This is especially true in the cinema, I think, simply because we can not easily return to refresh our memory in a movie theater. However, viewers like me do not have that problem because we see all our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in A Very Long Engagement (2004), both Finely crafted and complex stories with a great cast of characters. This previous offer surpasses the others in both directions: more characters and more complexity. <br /> <br /> Now, other directors have used those techniques before: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is that, in the first place, the director allows us to "see" inside the heads of some of the characters and, second, some scenes are repeated as a means to refresh the memory of the viewer as History flows between different periods of time. <Br /> <br /> The basic ?? The core, so to speak? The story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tautou), who is told by a fellow traveler on a train that she will meet her true love that day. This happens in the first minutes of the movie. The ingenious irony in this point is that Irene does not realize that the opposite young man (Gilbert Robin) can be that "a true love". And, neither he ... <br /> <br /> They go their separate ways without realizing the potential meaning of their close encounter. However, the results of the chaos during the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters that appear in a series of ingenious and interrelated vignettes that seem to go nowhere, and still .. . <br /> <br /> If the story were just that, it could be boring, and even quite predictable. Not so The script and the director take over our expectations with a lot of innovative scenes that are very common, but that become extraordinary and credible events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again. For example, the next time a bird poops from the sky falls on a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her destination man meet again. Or what about a stone chip flying on your windshield? Consider again what would happen ... <br /> <br /> All that is interesting enough. The most interesting thing for me was to evaluate each new man who came and try to decide if this was THE ONLY one for Irene, or if it was, in fact, the young man on the train. That kept me guessing for a while. <br /> <br /> I'll let you think about that, if you see this lovely romp. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
