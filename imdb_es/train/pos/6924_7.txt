This complicated western was a milestone in JAMES STEWART's career after his return from the service of the war. He wanted to change his image by making a western, which is largely considered the reason for the influx of westerns in the 50s, as it is very impressive. Too bad it has not been photographed in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart wins first prize for "the gun he won to the West," but then he has to spend the rest of the movie trying to get it back when it's stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS is a dark girl with an unpleasant reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the gunman of the local bad guy in Dodge City. WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boyfriend. And, would not you know? Being a Universal-International movie, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both quite unknown at the time) have bit roles. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence presents the first Indian attack, so CHARLES DRAKE reveals himself as a coward who leaves, leaving Shelley alone in the horse-drawn chariot. Later he redeems himself, but it's just one of the twists and turns that makes the weapon pass from one unpleasant hand to another, but eventually ends up with the rightful owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have a final firefight that is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as the end of DUEL IN THE SUN firearms. McNally becomes the perfect villain and DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous in the kind of villain role he played throughout the 1940s as a short-lived gunman. <br /> <br /> The well-constructed story is very well directed by Anthony Mann, and it's fun to see ROCK HUDSON (credited as Young Bull) with Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who throws looks yearning for the then thin and attractive Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing and definitely a story above average.
