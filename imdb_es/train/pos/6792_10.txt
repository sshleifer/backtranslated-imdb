I remember this game. I was always sitting alone on the shelves, until one day I decided to try something new for a change and I got this game. I looked at him in amazement, since it was the first game for the PS1 I had, which had 4 discs. When I played it, I could not turn off the controller, really. <br /> <br /> The story of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as the story of Final Fantasy VII, and that's hard. comply. When you play, you get so involved with the characters that it's amazing that it's just a PS1 game, because it feels like a movie. And I think it should become a movie. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this game is a little known game and that almost nobody has played it or liked it, since it is one of those games in which it is sitting. the ends of the shelves, with a 50% discount on the signal that is in it, trying to sell. Well, I am one of those people who always look at the extremes, try them out and most of them turn out to be really good. Hell, that's how I got to Final Fantasy VII, looking in a catalog and finding it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon, is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games, surprisingly. I would not be surprised if it was made by Square Enix, but it is not. Almost all the games I play are better than the Final Fantasy series, or the Dragon Quest series, but this is it. But what really bothers me is why it is so little known and laudable, as it should be. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? He is a PS1 man, made in 1999. The story that I mentioned is incredible, almost beats VII. The characters are incredible, you get very involved with them and their actions. <br /> <br /> A final 10 out of 10. No doubt deserves more praise, and a role play very well done by a company other than Square Enix. .
