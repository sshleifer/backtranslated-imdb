Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his companions embark on a space mission that sees them fly through Saturn's rings. His companions are killed instantly, but it seems that in fact they are the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth a mass of humanoid pulp that oozes constantly; As he becomes a savage killer, melting every step of the way, his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning) tracks him. <br /> <br /> This is often very funny, with enough absurd lines. and the situations to which you have to go, which is hard for me to believe that the laughter is not intentional. I think it's kind of silly in the low budget genre efforts of the 50s and 60s, and as such, it's a wonderfully entertaining movie. That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. We're even treated with a split-screen sequence that does not really add anything, but it's still a gas to see. <br /> <br /> Writer / screenwriter William Sachs deserves credit for presenting this ingenious idea; His ultra-thin character is memorable. I think his rhythm is a little off; Some scenes (like that of the elderly couple) last a little longer, but ultimately, it offers solid, bizarre, B-movie products with a degree of panache. The climax is especially fun. <br /> <br /> The music of Arlon Obers is tremendously shocking (although also funny at times), and the cinematography of Willy Curtis creates some really great shots sometimes. That brings me to the fantastic and compelling makeup effects of Rick Bakers, who form a very respectable centerpiece for the film, right down to the last final meltdown. <br /> <br /> Rebar is under heavy makeup for most of the movie (Sachs also gets my compliments for starting the movie) and does what he has to do well enough. DeBenning is a pretty stupid and foolish hero, and Ann Sweeney is not as good as his wife either, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are fine to support him. It's also worth seeing people like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (doing a measurable topless shot), Janus Blythe (from "Eaten Alive" by Tobe Hoopers and "The Hills Have Eyes from Tobe Hoopers" and "The Hills Have Eyes"). by Wes Cravens), and even director Jonathan Demme. a small part. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining midnight movie, with enough blood, chills and laughter to qualify it as worthy of being caught by science fiction / low grade horror lovers everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
