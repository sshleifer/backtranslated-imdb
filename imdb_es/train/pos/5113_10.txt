This movie was a classic. I should say that this film captured the best of a hardworking man who learns from his mistakes. if we could all get along and learn how they all did in this movie. He had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life, and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a "GREAT THROAT" and swallow is pride.
