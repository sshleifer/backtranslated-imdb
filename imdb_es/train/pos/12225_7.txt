I've seen this movie and even though I knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still liked to watch it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes pretty much in the network of movies for life. And I'm thinking that, since it's close to Halloween, they could play it more. So, please, be careful if you are interested in seeing it. I think Alicia Silverstone played her role very well. I like her a lot as an actress and as a person. She seems so nice and realistic. Kevin Dillon, his performance was very good for me. I'm not trying to hit him or anything, but I think his brother Matt would have been able to better handle this evil and evil serial killer. Kevin seems too sweet for me. But I think he did it well.
