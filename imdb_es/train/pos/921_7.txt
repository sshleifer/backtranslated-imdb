In an attempt to find another "Hot Property" for adaptation, the Fleischer Brothers recalled their successful foray into the world of the Comic Strip with their production of POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer Studios / Paramount) from 1933. Although it was part of the series BETTY BOOP, Miss B. just made a brief appearance in the short; leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible appearance of a full-fledged series. <br /> <br /> AS is now of general knowledge, the gruff, red-eyed and red-haired sailor became perhaps the most successful cartoon series in history; Overcome and literally survive the Fleischers and their study, to this day. <br /> <br /> BACK to King Features for another lucky try was certainly the reason to try the very popular HENRY Comic Strip character on a BETTY BOOP Exit; The goal is the search for another series. The reasoning then surely seemed correct. HENRY was one of the most popular features in the Hearst Papers lineup; appears as a daily supplement and on Color Comics Sunday, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY. You know, "What fools are these mortals!" Do you remember that, Schultz? Seeing the chubby, small and bald guy from Comic Strip, 'Hero' and his antics on screen, both alone and in conjunction with Miss Betty; We were pleasantly surprised to see how well the character was handled. The story and the director Dave Fleischer provided a lot of situations similar to comic strips and visual gags that seemed more appropriate for the character of little Henry. These mostly silent vignettes were very important for the animated film, as they remain faithful to the printed page; as the characteristic of HENRY was realized mainly in a kind of 'mime' of 4 colors. <br /> <br /> IN the cartoon, entitled BETTY BOOP WITH HENRY: The American Living (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what it is; Basically being a situational exercise; be peppered with the usual set of Dave Fleischer's rapid fire, machine guns like machine guns. In short, Henry sees a puppy in the window of Betty Boop's pet store. It is a kind of love at first sight when Henry tries to buy the little puppy with the only money he had, with coins in his pocket. He is made up of Miss Boop who would cost $ 2.00 in money from the time of the depression to make the purchase. Tears appear when the little man goes down. <br /> <br /> BUT a reprieve is soon on the horizon when Betty asks the child to take care of the store, while she leaves for urgent matters. In exchange for his services, Miss Betty promises him the puppy in return. Of course, they have a deal and Betty leaves. <br /> <br /> TO COME TO THE WORK OF CLEANING BOXES AND TO FEED THE LIVESTOCK, YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY that the Fleischer team turn on a new series of gags; This time with bird seeds, Henry's bald head and brooms. (But not all at once, of course, Schultz!) Henry's enthusiasm for the mass feeding of the store's avian population, literally sowing his head, soon leads to a massive desertion of the birds; Outside the store, to the open street, on a massive getaway to jail. <br /> <br /> BETTY returns to this place and expresses his disappointment and anger over Henry's temporary custody care. All bets were closed, there is no dog for Henry. He starts to leave; Dejected but soon convinces the owner to give him another chance to fix things. With his head covered in bird seeds, he manages to corral all the small feathered creatures; returning them to your coop pet store. Fortunately, the little guy leaves; but this time he has his own loving puppy that licks his face. <br /> <br /> WITHOUT DOUBT this was a winning combination. We have the carefree, full of energy, free movement of the child, Betty's kindness and the emotions of the situation and the dubious result of the situation of the "child and his dog". Max and Dave Fleischer had given us a kind of mini-masterpiece almost less than a surreal comedy. <br /> <br /> We were quite surprised that he did not follow any series of HENRY. Judging from the character's fairly faithful treatment, it could certainly have been sustained for some time. In any case, this teamwork was, in many ways, the best of Betty Boop's paintings. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and barely counted on Betty Boop, except for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer); HENRY Short was much better than the next two tests of King Features, BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE KING and BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE JIMMY, both from 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
