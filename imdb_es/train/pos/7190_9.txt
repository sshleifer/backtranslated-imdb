The best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite series, period. This is a series period established just after the birth of Mexico. The new nation has the gold produced by this city to keep the republic solvent. However, as god of gold, Don del Oro is waving the Indians and stealing the gold for himself. His fox and his band of men to the rescue. Reed Hadley is a winning Fox and cuts a hasty figure as he gets into a good selection of remains (most of which were reused by the latest Zorro publications, as well as other series). The story moves and it is not very clear. Who is the real bad guy? There's a reason why I've seen this more than any other series I've seen, it's just a great adventure and action movie. The only thing with which I can compare it is with the Marca del Zorro with Tyrone Power or one of the other fans of the time. It is super and highly recommended.
