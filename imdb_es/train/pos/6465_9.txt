This film, recently voted the public's favorite at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival, is inspiring and moving. A famous conductor, forced to retire due to illness, returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the choir of the church and, finally, find satisfaction in his music. Based on the Swedish features of keeping things inside oneself and the insular character of a small Swedish town, this film develops well each of its characters. Superbly directed, acted and sung, he brought tears to many eyes and smiles to all. Hopefully you will find distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, look at it!
