I really like this show. That's why I was disappointed to know recently that George Lopez is a racist and that he fired Masiela Lusha from the program, simply because he discovered that she was not a Latina immigrant, but an immigrant from Albania. I learned this from the people in the program. She was really one of the best parts of the program and, therefore, to learn that even among those who one would think would be sensitive to racism, who may also hate someone, just because of the country where they were born, it is really disappointing.
