I participate in a Filmmakers Symposium, and this film was shown after we had seen a not so good movie and participated in a 40 minute discussion. Even though it was incredibly late and we were tired, the whole audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the movie was hilarious in all the right places, and I loved the peculiar cast of characters. They really grow in you in the movie.
