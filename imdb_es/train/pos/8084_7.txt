<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and I saw it for the first time the other night. I have been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years, since I left high school. I did not grow up in this movie ... maybe my mother kept me away from her. Definitely not for children. Not that it is bad in a graphic sense, but that the issues would go directly on most of the 10-year bosses. In general, the animation was excellent, since it was made in 1978/1979. I thought that the story followed the book quite well in a vague sense. But it bothers me that Bashki has not added another 40 minutes or so and has relied on the parts of the Return of the King. That would have been the definitive movie. I was upset by his abrupt end, and then, when I heard that the king's return was crap, it bothered me even more. Too bad it was not a great animation movie. I could have gotten a bigger vote from me. I give it a 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will do justice to the books with the new live action LOTR.
