I laughed a lot while watching this. It's a funny short with a fun musical act and a lot of madness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the stylization of humor. Dialogue is fun and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last, everything seems to flow beautifully. There's Max, who apparently has led a horrible life. And there's Edward, who is not sure what life he wants to take. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's crazy boss. Tom has a short but memorable role. Highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor. And you can find it online now, which is an advantage! I'm a fan of all of Jason's cartoons and I can not wait to see what comes next.
