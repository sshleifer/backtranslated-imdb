Outside of your country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those movies that, from Western eyes, are supposed to be experienced in drugs or analyzed in depth.

There is a general theme about water, or the lack of it (possibly because of the cat that drowns at the beginning? Possibly for the title?). There is an interesting kind of Genesis. There is a pig that eats itself. An elephant made of water.
