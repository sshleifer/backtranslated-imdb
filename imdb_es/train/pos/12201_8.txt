Made in 1946 and released in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai was one of the great films made by Welles after returning from relative exile to make Citizen Kane. Dark, meditating and expressing something of the paranoia of the Cold War, this film stands out as a crime film from Film-Noir. The cinematography of this film is full of the peculiarities of Welles characteristic of strange angles, fast cuts, long pans and a sinister lighting. The use of street environmental music is a precursor to Touch of Evil's incredible and long opening shot, and the mysterious Chinese characters and sequences in Chinatown can only be seen as the inspiration, in many ways, of Roman Chinatown Polanski Unfortunately, it is Welles' obsession with technical cinema that hurts this movie in its entirety. The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible disorder of cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> However, despite this criticism, the story combined with the wonderful performances of Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) makes this film a joy to watch. Orson Welles not only achieves the Irish accent, but also the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at that time, breaks with her usual roles as goddess of sex and assumes a role of real depth and contradictions. Finally, the strange and strange representation of Glenn Anders or the law partner of Elsa's spouses is nothing short of a classic!
