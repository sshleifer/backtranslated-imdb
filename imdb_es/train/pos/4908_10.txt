The first time I saw Martin Day was when I was 10 years old, at home, on The Movie Channel, and I still remember the impact it had on my life. It moved me like no other movie had touched me, and I remember taking my eyes out. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw it, I could not find it anywhere else. I would ask around and nobody had heard about the movie! I guess it was one of those rarest movies that many people did not know, because nobody, and I mean nobody, knew what he was talking about. I searched and searched through the years, reviewing shelves of video stores and scanning cable TV listings, but always fell short. Finally, in 1996 I discovered that I could make a special request, I did it, and I've probably seen it at least 50 times since then, and it still makes me cry, every time. <br /> <br /> Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man who is in prison (but who really is a good guy), who longs to return to the special lake where he grew up as a child. This was a special place, where he lived outside of nature, spent time with his dog and stayed alone to enjoy life. Soon in the film, he escapes and begins to return to the lake. <br /> <br /> It is not long before the police find him, and Steckert grabs a child as a hostage to convince the police to back off. off. Soon, Steckert and his hostage (the second Martin) become best friends and have many fun adventures together, from stealing a toy truck to transporting a train by train, all on the way to this special lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Steckert has great flashbacks of him on the lake as a child. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the ending for you, but I will tell you that this movie is a must see. It's the BEST movie I've seen in my life! I am, without a doubt, the biggest fan of this movie! I managed to find the song that the two Martin's are singing throughout the movie ("I'm going back, where I'm coming from ...) I'm even planning a trip to Canada to see the lake and the country house where There's the Martin's Day was filmed, crazy, I know, but that movie means a lot to me.
