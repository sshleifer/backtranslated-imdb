I had the pleasure of seeing this beautiful movie last night, with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director after the viewing. I suspect that the first commentator has never lost a father or someone very close to them in death. I have had many losses, and this movie spoke to me. One of the main issues is how we do not treat the questions / problems / stories with our loved ones until it is too late; They are too incapacitated or dead before that happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen and record their stories, tell the people you love, resolve the differences. I loved the message that there are no mistakes. I love the director's portrait of the relationship of the two daughters: as one of the six sisters, it is clear to me that he understood how complex these relationships are. His story as a filmmaker is also clear: what a beautiful movie! The casting is outstanding, a film that should not be missed!
