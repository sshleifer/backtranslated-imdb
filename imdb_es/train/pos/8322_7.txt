IQ is a cute romantic comedy with two great actors who seem to click on the screen. The plot is a typical type of bad for a girl, the boy gets the girl format, but points out that one should love with the heart and not with the mind. The addition of Albert Einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief. In general, a good movie. Not very good, but good.
