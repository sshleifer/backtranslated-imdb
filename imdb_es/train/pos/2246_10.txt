A wonderful surprise of Spanish cinema. I never thought that Jordi Molla could be a great director, after all, I do not really care much about his choice in movies. However, this movie was absolutely fantastic and nothing predictable ... something I ALWAYS enjoy! It has not had a lot of good press and I really do not think it's ever published in the US market. We will have to content ourselves with the DVD or VHS if that ... I do not want to say much about the story because I do not want to spoil it, but basically the film is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for fun and to get something out of it. money (like so many others), before he knows it, he is immersed in a life he did not count on.
