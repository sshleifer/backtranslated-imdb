I have to admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can not beat a person with a strong cinematic presence style. A Chinese fantasy image may not be easy to present to an audience, the director tried to recover the classic fantasy tales of Zu Mountain and this is what he showed. <br /> <br /> The new Legend of Zu has really improved from that of 1983. From this new millennium update, we could see Tsui Hark's vision of the Zu Mountains. Spectacular visual designs, amazing epics of action and fantasy done wonderfully well. He kept me glued to the whole painting. Great cast with good performance. It's truly a fun movie to watch, but is it too strange? <br /> <br /> Now the downside is that people will definitely get confused with their vast shortened story in a 95 minute movie. The plot may not have much relationship between the characters, but when you return to see the movie, you will have a better sense of the understanding of the characters themselves. Some may complain that there is not too much physical combat, besides that the characters have supernatural powers to defeat the enemies, the spirits that fight hand to hand would have no meaning at all. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this beautiful and elegant image. It may have a little story, but if we look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", the plot also confused us, but it was really something elegant and impressive. Tsui Hark always attracts something different in H.K. Movie theater. American audiences may have difficulty understanding while watching this movie, because this is not a crouching Tiger, a Hidden Dragon, this is a completely new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, but its special effects are really better than the Storm Riders. It really is worth taking a look.
