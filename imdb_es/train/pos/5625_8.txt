The attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being approached by a lone cyclist. She is mortally shocked by the fact that her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker makes his way into the house of Marjorie and submits to a humiliating terror. Purple and bloody, Marjorie manages to control her attacker, removing the daylight by force and leaving him helpless thanks to the spray of wasp in his eyes and throat. Hog tied up and mistreated, Joe tries to explain himself to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they get home. There is almost a hint of mercy, but it does not come from Marjorie. Should she continue to give her own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and harsh language constitute a qualification of R. Fawcett really moves away from the sordid papers that will always taint his career. Congratulations to director Robert M. Young.
