Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why everyone says he has a slow pace. I thought the pace was perfect. The film is about Michael Sullivan, played by Tom Hanks to perfection, who is a kind of hitman who works for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He does not like this job, but he does it because Rooney paid for his house and helps him financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But, his children do not know that this is his job, and when one witnesses a cold-blooded murder committed by him, he is placed in an awkward position. And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and insists on revenge. They steal many and much more and build a bond. They are the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always, as does Jude Law, who plays his spooky role perfectly. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and shows to a large extent what the thirties were like.
