Sudden Impact is the best of Dirty Harry's five films. They do not come thinner and more petty than this while Harry romps in a series of violent confrontations, with the bad guys getting their just desserts. Which is just how I like it. Great story also and skillfully directed by Clint himself. Excellent entertainment
