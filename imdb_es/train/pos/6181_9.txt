A very entertaining movie, as long as you know how to see old musicals / mysteries. She may not approach Agatha Christie or even Thin Man like a black film, but it is much more interesting than her typical "backstage" musical for boys or girls. As a musical, it is not a Busby Berkley or Freed unit, but it can boost the classic "Coctails for two" and the strange "Sweet Marijuana". The film takes place in real time during a theatrical show, the opening night of "Vanities", where a murder is discovered, and soon another, behind the scenes. Is the murderer discovered before the curtain falls? Of course, but the search is fun, although somewhat predictable and disfigured by outbursts of comic relief (fortunately in the form of the well-formed goddess of the choir girls, Toby Wing). The stupid cop is a little too stupid, the main hero is a little too friendly, the protagonist is a bit funny, the evil prima donna a little too malicious, and the girlfriend is a bit too self-sacrificing, but like stereotypes. Come on, they are quite elegant. There is a group of really beautiful choristers, who are chosen even better than the girls for a Busby Berkley musical of the same period, who sometimes tend to be a little fat. Yes, this movie could have been much better than it is, and Duke Ellington's number is a shame, but if you like to dive in old movies, this will be a tremendously tempting journey.
