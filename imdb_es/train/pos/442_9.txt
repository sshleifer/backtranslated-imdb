This is what I call a growth film. Each character is different and better at the end, and all because a woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "love tub". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedian, really shines as the woman who produces all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being self-centered to better men. The book remained very faithful to the novel, which is an advantage in my book, since I am a librarian. The impressive landscape and the genuine love message.
