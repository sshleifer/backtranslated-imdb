Meatball Machine is an amazing splash movie, it has an original plot with young love, blood cubes and strange alien creatures that mutate people into monstrous robotic war machines. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is not for everyone, people who love splash movies or the movie Tetsuo: the iron man will applaud her. <br /> <br /> Special effects can be cheesy at some points in the movie, but you're not supposed to take the movie very seriously. . <br /> <br /> However, in general, it's very funny, well, if you find budding romantics infested with a viscous tumor like bits that seek to destroy each other in bloody exotic battles.
