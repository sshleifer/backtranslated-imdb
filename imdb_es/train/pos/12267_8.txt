Tintin was one of my favorite heroes when I was a kid. I used to borrow books from the school library whenever I had the opportunity. My favorite was "The Sharks of the Red Sea", lots of action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant exposition of Herge's background story and his Tintin development. The filmmaker's personal experience in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who inspired the character of Chan was very moving. <br /> <br /> A great documentary by a very talented and beloved artist. . A great example of someone who has become internationally famous and has brought the joy of millions of children (and young people at heart) from around the world.
