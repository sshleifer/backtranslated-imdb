My 2 year old son likes the Doodlebops show, he seems to keep his attention for a while. The characters are interesting, vibrant with primary colors and everything. There is not much educational content that can benefit the target audience, but it seems that they have a theme in each program and they try to teach children to share and respect and other basics, so I like that. It is well produced with high production values. But in reality it's just an average program like most television shows these days. We do not buy in the angle of merchandise and our son wears everything Dooblebop. I do not think we would spend money to go to a live show, if they ever came to the city. Going to the Zoo or the Science Center is a much better experience for everyone involved and, in my opinion, it is a better spent money.
