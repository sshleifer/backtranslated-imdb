I saw Insomniac's nightmare not so long ago for the first time and I have to say that I found it pretty good. If you are a Dominic Monaghan fan you will love it. The movie of the hole takes place inside your mind, does not it? The performance of everyone else is a bit hasty and shaky and some of the scenes could be reduced, but in the end it works. The extras on the DVD are as great as the movie, if not bigger for the fans of Dom. He has a lot of honest moments from the set, shots and a great interview with the director. Anyone who has made an independent film will love seeing Tess (the director), Dom and everyone else in the small personal set that tries to play this creepy little movie. It was quite nice and I'm glad to have it in my collection.
