This was the first "Walking Tall" movie that I saw, I think in a $ 2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd., so I had no reference to the first delivery made by Joe Don Baker. I remember being surprised by the corrupt system of McNairy County and the brutality of the "redneck gangs". I was also surprised that a man decided he was not going to let it go, and went out to do something about it. Brave? I thought so, to a point where it gave me the chills. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a great story about the American courage to get up and do something about a system that only serves their own interest. I was very impressed with this, and I think that this is still one of the best movies of the hero / antihero genre, which one can laugh at but includes recent films like "The Punisher", but even more because it is a true story. The recent remake starring "Rock" simply does not do justice to the real fire in Buford Pusser's story. <br /> <br /> A "classic" that I'm sure will reappear in the future.
