Like most people, I've seen Jason Priestley on television and I think it's great. But I did not know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" veiled like the other woman scorned. Good music, intrigue and a death scene that involves Amanda's revenge on an abusive Dr. who will stay with you for weeks. I'll leave it like that. Prestige.
