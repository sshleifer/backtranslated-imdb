And that is why historical / biographical films are so important for all of us, also, when they are so well made, like this one. <br /> <br /> Before watching "The Young Victoria", I knew some things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I have much more knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is simply BIG as Victoria (who would guess!) and will probably get a nomination at this year's Oscars. Personally, I encourage her ... <br /> <br /> For technical reasons, I am pleased to say that it is a very successful production, with a wonderful art direction / stage decoration and, of course, as if it were Expect it to be, an excellent newspaper costume design! <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that I want to see more and know more about this interesting queen, but above all, an amazing woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
