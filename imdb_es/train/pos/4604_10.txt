This film is definitely a perfect 10/10 ... for all the people who are rating the low ratings of this film because it does not have a "good plot" or anything like that, that's ridiculous, saying that a Jackie Chan movie It's bad Because its plot is like saying that a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you see Jackie Chan FOR STRUGGLE SCENES, because the action is not so focused on a good story or something, if you look at how he makes movies and compares them to other American films of that time and even later you will realize that the movies Jackie Chan had overcome the main fight scenes and they were not really good plots, while the American movies had good plot but crap action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time. Pornography is pornography, Jackie Chan is seen ACTION, I think people are calling it wrong because there is no plot because you think that this is how an intelligent film critic would qualify a good movie, but the way I see her is a good movie is a movie that can entertain me. Of course, half of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but in this case, the rest, which are action scenes and acrobatics, pay for all that. This changed the way American action movies were created, they even have strange scenes from this movie. If you want a real man, a true artist, watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan, who is pure in every way. Literally, it makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in TODAYS movies. American films depend on special effects and security cables as well as doubles and much more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan movies are the works of a true artist who tries his best and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece
