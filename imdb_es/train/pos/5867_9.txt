Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80s. It is a film that breathes through an incredible performance and a very interesting direction. In Jacknife, both European and American film lovers can find things to relate to. The script is very attractive and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the best performances to date. Portrays your alcoholic hero by making us feel his heart broken in every line, in every movement. Robert De Niro makes us think once again of him as one of the best actors of all time in one of the simplest but also most realistic performances of his career. Jacknife is never getting bored, as he shows his heroes without typical elements of the typical Hollywood characters. After the war, none is a hero. Everyone is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth. No one can repair their pieces after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war creates. Simply magnificent movie.
