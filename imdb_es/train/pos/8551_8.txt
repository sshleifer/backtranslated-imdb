Ti% s and As *, many boobies. Some great characters, jokes full of fun and well-organized teen action in this turn of the Amercan Pie franchise. This feels like an old school. It feels a bit like Porkys for the 2000s. Some great funny characters combined with some very funny situations make this a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> While the original cast has gone except for one, I found this movie very entertaining. Do not get too excited, you have to take it for the teen comedy that it is, but for what it is, it stands out. The characters are nice and funny, the girls are hotter than hell. Fun and games are fun, with some things I've never seen before in comedies, they make me tremble, but they laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> So ignore those who hate and run to see this. You believe Do not expect the classic American Pie, but expect something that makes you laugh and wake up your attention for an hour or so.
