I can give you four reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best filmmakers in contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories, related in a grand scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good cast. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection on the biggest problem in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comic humor about the authority that practices extortion against ordinary people and that expects to be appreciated by your efforts. <br /> <br /> Then, Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second piece with an inherited history of Italian neorealism with an anecdote of "Pedro and the wolf". <br /> <br /> In the third story, the one that seems most independent of this series even in context, Carlos Carrera tells the story of a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. But after the recent lynching in Tlahuac and the tradition in this terrible matter in the State of Mexico, this story could not be more up-to-date. <br /> <br /> And in the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to black humor in the "grand finale" in which he gathers most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the best comedy pieces ever filmed. Rethinking the central scene of one of his previous films "All Power", Sariñana gives the final lesson of the subject. And, by the way, give us the scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti doing a brief striptease. <br /> <br /> Once the movie is over, it has the bittersweet feeling of having seen a good movie (and maybe I enjoyed it) with a very painful theme. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own misfortune and this is the best example. This film is a testimony of how Mexicans learned to live in the middle of a criminal state (and maybe they accepted it), between two fires: the criminals and the supposed authorities full of corruption. Even this movie is an illusion because almost all good people have been victims of a crime and are not unharmed. If you had an assault without a scratch, then you're lucky. Meanwhile, do not miss the opportunity to see this movie, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
