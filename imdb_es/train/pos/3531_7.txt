Robert Siodmak does a fabulous job with this B Noir starring Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does, I might add, without much help from his male actors, that is, Curtis and Tone. It's Raines at all times, a beautiful long-legged actress who, for one reason or another, never achieved the status of some of her "noir" colleagues. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's use of sex, light, shadows and music is really remarkable as he tackles this genre. Shadows, lighting effects and camera angles are effective. But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff of Elisha Cook, driven by an excited Raines. It is this scene that brings "Phantom Lady" to a new territory. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's commitment to the material is matched only by Raines, who performs a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man. Franchot Tone phoned this one. Alan Curtis did not seem upset that he could die and did not seem happy to have lived. And never, except for a brief moment in prison, seemed to be in love with Raines. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about many of these films is that, as the Second World War advanced, interest in psychiatry intensified. But often the terms were used incorrectly in films like "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth". Thomas Gomez calls Tone paranoid. Probably, Tone has some paranoia associated with his disorder, but seems to be closer to a psychopath. Actually, as his headaches show, he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain. <br /> <br /> The Ghost Lady does not have the best plot, but it's worth seeing.
