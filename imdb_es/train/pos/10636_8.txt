This story is a complex and wonderful story of the last Harem of the Ottoman Empire, well told and provocative, we see the inner workings of a vanished world and we learn about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I Enjoyed the story, the characters, the acting and the scenes. Some scenes suffered rapid editing and the subtitles sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece. <br /> <br /> The main character, Safiya, is beautifully played by Marie Gillain, and I am pleased to say that he did a fantastic job without exaggerating. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are lovely and charming. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something less of Hollywood and more authentic to the world that is emulating.
