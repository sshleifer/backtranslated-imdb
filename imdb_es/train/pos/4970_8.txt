Some critics considered this film grim, but for me there was enough good humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is the center of the film, often counterbalancing the unhappy aspects of the setting and the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the end result is not predictable: I felt that I could have gone in any direction. <br /> <br /> By the way, many criticisms I have read mention the effective use of black and white, but the impression I saw, shown on the SBS television network here in Australia, was in full color. <br /> <br />
