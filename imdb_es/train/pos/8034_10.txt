There are few movies that seem to provide interest and realism. If you have ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern warfare, take a look at this one. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene where hundreds of soldiers are shooting to shoot in the jungle, is nobody really sure where that shot occurred? <br /> <br /> And, they stole a scene from Saving Private Ryan, so he has to have some merit on the scene. <br /> <br />
