A somewhat fictitious biographical portrait of the first years of Abraham Lincoln of Director John Ford, which focuses mainly on a trial in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder. <br /> <br /> The film offers an interesting description of this important American. Figure and the film is well done, but it seems somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments of his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intention was to portray Lincoln as a young man who develops the attributes that would make him the great man he would become. But the result for me was that, while I admired the portrait, it was not as satisfying as I think it could have been with a wider scope. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda who effectively shows a quiet strength. Fonda's performance includes some ungainly manners and other affectations that are quite effective in presenting a portrait of Lincoln, particularly when combined with effective make-up and costumes that are occasionally a little obvious. <br /> <br /> The cast of support is solid and, surprisingly, does not include many of Ford's regular cast (sometimes referred to as his stock company), but we do have Ward Bond, one of the actors in most prolific Hollywood characters. Bond has appeared in more than 100 of AFI's best films than any other actor, both the original and the revised list. He has also appeared in 11 nominees for Best Picture. <br /> <br /> The film presents a scene that seems to have inspired a quite similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird", in which it would become even better. It's here, although that scene is one of the most effective in this movie.
