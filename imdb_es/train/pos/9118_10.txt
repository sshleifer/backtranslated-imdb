I saw this movie with a special screening of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah. It's very interesting where this guy came from. Now he is probably the key independent African filmmaker in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers, but about filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea of ​​whether something attests to the diversity and variety of African themes, with his film 500 years later, is an African theme. But the idea does not fit into that mold. Showing artistic diversity. The film is a totally African cast, but the theme is a human theme that most of us could relate to. I love the soft comedy in it. And the Kode of Tunde Jegede is simply amazing, it's really an artistic gem.
