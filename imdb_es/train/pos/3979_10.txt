I would like all the fans of this documentary to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I am very proud of him. This miniseries shown on VH1 is a great look at the culture of drugs in the last 30 years and my uncle worked hard on it. The amount of time and effort that I have seen him put into this documentary and the book that started it all (I can not find my way home) makes it much better to watch it on television. I know that he loves what he does and he does it well. His eloquence is shown in the interviews, which he himself did, and the incredible additions that he himself adds to the comment. From music to videos and everything else, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the culture of drugs through the eyes of someone who lived it. I appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it (or not) and would love to hear from fans! Three cheers for Uncle Martin!
