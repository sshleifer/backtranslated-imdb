I saw this movie years ago on television at night. At that time it was for the title of "Ladder to Heaven". Even as a child, I remember that the story moved me deeply and I was amazed by the visual effects of the trial in court (those who have seen it know what I am talking about). What imagination! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this film lives up to the best classics ever created: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This film is rated as extremely high by IMDB voters and, rightly so, more than 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10; More than 84% rated it with 8 or more than 10. I was surprised that it did not appear in the 250 best movies until I realized that very few have seen / rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this film is released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1) can buy it and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
