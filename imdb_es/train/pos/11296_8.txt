I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 years old and fresh out of high school, I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Workers and Transporters Union of Hod. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes, etc., for one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning, a bus was waiting for me and about 20 of us headed south towards San Diego. Shortly before arriving at a military base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we got into a bunk, we headed north, a few miles, towards Camp Pendleton, the great marine base. There, on the beach, we began to build what was supposed to be a base of the Japanese Pacific islands. It took about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, cannon cuts, ditches with sandbags and living quarters. All this was with a very high salary, sometimes "golden time", which tripled our regular salary per hour. Our food was also first class = prime rib at lunch, etc., which was amazing because it was wartime and it was very difficult to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> Once the work is finished, I waited impatiently for the film to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited anxiously through two hours of the movie before my work finally appeared on the screen. Then, they were not more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the heroes of the film dive bombing the base and making it fly. A bit disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since. I later learned that this movie was backed by the government and that Fox was paid on a more cost basis, which may justify our extravagant payment and our lifestyle there. Bob Weverka
