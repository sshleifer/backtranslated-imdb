At a time when Hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses, desperation, crime, drugs and war, this film reminds us of the concept of the "Indomitable Spirit". If you feel defeated, this movie will free your mind and make you fly. We all know how difficult life can be; At some point we must remember that perseverance and courage will help us to get ahead. That's what this movie did for me and I hope it does for you.
