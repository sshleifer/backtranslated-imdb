I have not laughed so much about a movie in a long time. I had to go to an advanced exam, and I was excited because I was dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout much of the movie. The audience shared my laughter, and clapped and shouted in most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Steve Carrell (who had already been a fan). He demonstrates in this film his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God, there was not a Will Ferrell cameo (I love it, but I saw it too much this summer). <br /> <br /> There were parts of the comic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to writing (also Carrell). The wax scene and the speed with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I will definitely go to see 'Virgin Year Old Virgin' when it is published. My advice: go see it for great laughs and an incredibly nice movie.
