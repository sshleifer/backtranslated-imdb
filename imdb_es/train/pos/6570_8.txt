This movie is harmless fun escapist. Something that was missing from the recent Tomb Raider movie. I can not wait to get the DVD. How can people give this a low score and keep watching the Titanic without a guilty conscience? I do not know. Anything with Karen Kopins in her underwear has to score one or two extra points!
