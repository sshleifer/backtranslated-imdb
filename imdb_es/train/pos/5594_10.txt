Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> The first world view of a 19-year-old, Hedy Lamarr, occurs in the first moments of the treasure of this decade of 1930, while sweeping screen in an angelic wedding dress. This was the beginning of a legendary race. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman who has adorned the silver screen. <br /> <br /> It's Eve's wedding night (Lamarr) and her older husband does not seem interested in his romantic advances. He retires to the solitary bed and, in a beautiful scene, fiddles with his wedding ring when he realizes his matrimonial error. The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than in love. Gustav Machaty uses magnificent camera angles and a pristine frame to capture the considerable talent and beauty of Lamarr. Without words spoken in the first part of the film, she is able to capture our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It is that combination that prepared the audiences of the 1930s for what they were about to see as the film developed. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time ... Some thought it was scandalous. <br /> <br /> She returns home to her father's property and files for divorce. The next day, she wakes up with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. Just go out and feel the freedom of the countryside and the fresh air. Eva goes for a ride on horseback and goes through a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to appear nude in a major film. His party in the forest and his adventure of submerging in the lake were legendarily scandalous. But the public could not stay away. As in many of today's movies, the controversy turned it into a movie that must be seen. <br /> <br /> Eva's naughty adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, which had escaped with her clothes. After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall in love. Their first romantic encounter was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its flagrant waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does a beautiful job in these romantic moments. Machaty creates a delicious moment, when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a magnificent trick of the camera. <br /> <br /> It can not be overstated how brave this performance was on Lamarr's part. Many could have presumed it was a career suicide. Instead, she gained her worldwide fame and was struck by Louis B Mayer, who signed her for a contract with MGM. There are some truly erotic moments in this movie, even by today's standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930s. Again, Machaty was very intelligent with his images, leaving much to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is extremely well done. <br /> <br /> The meeting of Eva's ex-husband and his current lover is perhaps inevitable. However, the consequences of that meeting are not. The film takes some unexpected twists in its final act and everything becomes a great story and a delightful debut on the big stage of the film's stardom for Hedy Lamarr. <br /> <br /> I recommend this time once controversial, now tame the film and urge you to look for it in its restored form on DVD. It's worth it, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is convincing too and the direction is ahead of its time. 'Ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler movie reviews!
