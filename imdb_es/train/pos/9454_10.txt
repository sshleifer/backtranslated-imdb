In what is arguably the best outdoor adventure movie of all time, four men in the city face the wrath of nature, in a story of survival. The scenario is Georgia, with its forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> The director, John Boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to represent supporting characters. These locals imbue the film with a depth of character unequaled in the history of cinema. No central "actor" of the casting could approach the faces, voices or remarkable actions of these people. I do not remember a movie in which the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. More than anything else, it is this harsh realism that makes this film so amazing. <br /> <br /> Another strength is the theme of the film. Nature, in the wild, can be violent. How appropriate that the scenario be the American South. Very few places in the United States are, or have been, as violent as the peasant country. In a story about Darwinian survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature, not separated from it. <br /> <br /> The "liberation" is a product of its time when, unlike today, the Americans expressed their concern for a desert in disappearance. The magnificent scenery of the film, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets and the roar of the river rapids, combined with the absence of civilization, transmit an environmental message. And that is another of the strengths of the film. <br /> <br /> At the entertainment level, tension gradually increases as the plot progresses. Not even halfway in the movie, the tension becomes extreme, and then never gives way, not until the final credits accumulate. Very few films can maintain that level of intensity in such a long period of plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is first class. The address and editing are impeccable. The cinematography is excellent. The dialogue is interesting. And the performance is great. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a good job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film, it is music, which seems to me timid. <br /> <br /> In general, "Deliverance" will surely attract the spectators who like the adventure outdoors. Even for those who do not, the sandy characterizations, the acting and the tension of the plot are enough reasons to see this film, one of the best in the history of cinema.
