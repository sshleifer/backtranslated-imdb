Gunga Din (1939) is based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling. The film is directed by George Stevens. It is set in India during the nineteenth century, where three British soldiers must stop an evil guru and his murderous cult. Munga Din is a wonderful war of adventures. Comedy with a lot of exciting moments. The three main men are brilliant. Gary Grant is the Sergeant. Archibald Cutter. Victor McLaglen is the Sergeant. Mac MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (the son of the legendary you know who) is Sergeant Thomas. Ballantine. Let's not forget the other excellent players that include Sam Jaffe playing Gunga Din in a brilliant way. The beautiful and talented Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins. It is very fun to observe the difficulties of Tommy and Emmy's wedding plans. Too much fun. It can be fun, it can be exciting. It may be all that a good movie requires.
