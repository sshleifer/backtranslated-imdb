Besides being an extremely funny movie, I must add that the costumes and the stage were wonderful. This kind and funny woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their money in their hands. This woman was lonely since the death of her husband. He had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be demolished. To avoid that, she bought it. His daughters feared that he was throwing "his" money and decided to take action. The actors of the characters in this movie were also a great advantage. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library, but until now, it has never been released. Sad.
