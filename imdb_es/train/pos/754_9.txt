['If you were not there, unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you. What I say is a shame because although part of the performance is amateur, it is destined to be realism. Let&#39;s face it: in real life, we do not say things in an exact or perfect way, even when we want to do it. In this sense, it works. This, however, does not apply to our &quot;known&quot; actors in this film, particularly to Jodie Foster (born naturally). The fact that the other 3 girls are not achieved only adds to the story: Jodie plays with the glue that struggles to maintain their close friendship, even with the obvious feeling of doom. Which means that no matter how close friends are, eventually there are some people who simply fade away, no matter how you try. <br /><br /> And there is the core of the film. It&#39;s not about a party, it&#39;s not about sexuality, it&#39;s about these 4 girls and their last time as girls even before they have to go to the world alone. <br /><br /> If you have ever had a friendship like that in your life, you will feel this movie: it will mean a lot to you, no matter what time it is set or when you grew up. We all knew these girls. At school, or at least I knew about them. We all knew the frustrated virgin, half of us wanted to maintain ourselves in childhood and half of us desperately wanted to grow up and think that I would do it for her. We all knew the crazy guy, the fashion dish whose vanity hides his fear of the world, his fear of acceptance. We all knew the party girl, of whom they whispered, with stories not only of their sad family life but of their notorious feats. And we all knew the &quot;mother figure&quot;, the one a little more real, a little more rooted, a little sadder because I knew what would happen. Maybe you were one of those girls. Maybe, like me, you had been at one time or another ... <br /><br /> This film really captures that fragile moment in life when the need, the needs, the pressures, the condition of a woman, childhood, the world and loneliness are incorporated in the head of every woman, every factor on the precipice. What are you clinging to? What are you pulling on the edge, no matter how you want to stand? And how painful is it to say goodbye to everything you&#39;ve known? That&#39;s what this movie is: it goes to the status of a woman and clings to childhood, and how difficult it is to keep walking. If you were there, you know ... and you love this movie, like I do. Pain and tenderness done. A fine piece of captured femininity.']
