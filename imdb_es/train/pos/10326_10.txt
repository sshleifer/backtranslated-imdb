Very often we talk about film milestones: Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. However, a film is very often overlooked by "serious" film critics. Of course, I'm talking about the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.) <br /> <br /> This film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of the exploitation of developing nations by US imperialism. Not to mention kung-fu. <br /> <br /> He also had the best soundtrack in film history (until, of course, the impressive work of Queen in Flash Gordon). Although it is a little weird, this movie is worth looking for, since it will return ten times the effort of your search.
