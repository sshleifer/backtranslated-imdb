I really liked that movie. As I am not a fan of Ed Wood Jr., I prefer to appreciate their "unlimited enthusiasm" and recognize their shortcomings. His films are funny, but his personal story is tormented by pain. I was hoping, and I loved to discover, that this movie would try to understand its turbulent life, instead of just filling it with posthumous praise. From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary to a mythology, leaving the cast and viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What we get is people who knew Ed Wood. it is better to speak about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and to show his character as much as Ed's. We understand Ed's personal and professional life: from his romances, his drinking, his sexuality, his friends, his enemies and even its filming. <br /> <br /> The film itself is shot in a low-budget form that seems to be done out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of the most released films since 1996 was disrespectful (like wearing a costume more beautiful than the President's). The stage designer uses the sense of humor and also a lot of information by relating each cast member with their background. <br /> <br /> Fans will be happy to hear personal testimonies about Ed Wood's controversies, and newcomers will be delighted. Surprised that this man was real. The DVD is full of impossible to find gems ("Crossroads of Lorado" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this movie is the surprisingly attractive and interconnected story. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through his association with him (for better or for worse), to the point where a woman will go down in history as "Pool Owner", for once, allowing him and his friends to be baptized in his pool. This ability to define a person's legacy is universally manifested, since the most striking effect of the film is not only to give a complete idea of ​​the man Ed Wood Jr. was, but also to provide a comprehensive view of the community he created. . created. Somehow, without having more than one cast member interviewed on screen at the same time, the connection that Ed Wood created among the different people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with a great sense of participation. <br /> <br /> Even the title alludes to the horror genre of the B list, but in the end, we see that even this is a kindness. What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that the entire cast will be woven forever in an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring to the unity of Wood's legend. <br /> <br /> In many ways, a life In contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed into a single point of view. This collaborative effort is as close to knowing what we can achieve. Being in itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is both respectful, provocative, reflective, exciting, fun, sad, kind and satisfying.
