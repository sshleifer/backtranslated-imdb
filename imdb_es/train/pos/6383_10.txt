I thought that this movie was very nice. I watched this movie with my wife BEFORE having my first child. Therefore, I did not see it as a simple family entertainment and I still enjoyed it. It seems that many of the critics point out that this film does not shake the earth, there were no unexpected changes in the plot and that the film was predictable and boring. If these people were watching this movie hoping to have a religious experience by doing so, then obviously they would be disappointed. This is simply an animated movie; nothing more. If you want to watch this movie just to relax and entertain yourself, you will not be disappointed. Finally, this is definitely not the best movie that Disney has done, but it is entertaining and I do not understand the bad reputation it has received.
