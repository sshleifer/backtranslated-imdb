Deliriously romantic comedy with interlaced subplots that combine perfectly with actors that bounce off each other with precise comic timing, a feat that is beautiful to contemplate. When Cher's spineless fianc√© asks him to help him make peace with his younger brother, distracted and moody, no one can dream of the consequences that follow. Operational symbolism, confessions of Catholic churches, bites of love and falling snow ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and soft. The rhythm of the image takes approximately 15 minutes (there is an early sequence with Grandpa and his dogs in the cemetery which is a bit harsh, and a following scene with Cosmo and the old man at the door looking obtuse), but The mosaic of the plot is interwoven with an agile ability, and the staggering tone of the film and the unbridled spirit are contagious. *** 1/2 of ****
