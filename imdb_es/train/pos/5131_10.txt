Jammin 'the Blues is an Oscar-nominated short from 1944 that consists basically of 10 minutes of jazz improvisation played in a long marmalade. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" at a point for the film's climax and then jitterbugs with Archie Savage to take this more entertaining "impromptu" session to its exciting finale. The director Gojn Mili was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that make this one of the most innovative angles of the 40s. According to some notes, I read that one of the musicians was white and that it had to be filmed in silhouette, as a reflection of the social attitudes of the time. What a pity. Still, this most unusual movie of the time is available on YouTube, so if you like jazz, I suggest you look for it there.
