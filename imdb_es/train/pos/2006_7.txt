['At this point, it seems almost unnecessary to claim that Jon Bon Jovi offers a firm, strong and seamless performance like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim obtained in other films (The Leading Man, No Looking Back). But, in case someone is wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can act well and that is what is expected of him. It&#39;s easy to separate Derek from the guy who throws punches on VH-1. <br /><br /> I would not usually watch a horror movie. I hope they focus on the sensationalist blood instead of the dialogue and the plot. What pleased me most about this movie was that it was really moving a viable plot. Gore is not as much as becoming the focus of the film and it does not have a disturbing and realistic quality of films with budgets of higher technical effects. So, gore fans may be disappointed, but the fans of the stories will not. <br /><br /> Unlike an action movie like U-571, where the dialogue is located in the back seat of the bombing, we have the opportunity to meet &quot;the good guys&quot; and really worry about what happens to them. Some scenes are left unexplained (like Derek&#39;s hallucinations), but one has the feeling that certain aspects were what laid the groundwork for a sequel. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood in this movie, that sequel will never happen. These few cases are forgivable knowing that vampires could have been a continuous series. <br /><br /> Is this the best movie I&#39;ve seen in my life? No. Is it a good way to spend two hours entertaining? Yes. It will not leave the person who fears the horror films with insomnia and will not leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed. If you are somewhere between the horror genre and the horror genre lover, this movie is for you. Reach a happy medium with the effects and history that balance each other. <br /><br />']
