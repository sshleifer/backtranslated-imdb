The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what struck me first of all. I expected a gore fest, but instead I could see a very intelligent killer sticking my head in a chilling soundtrack (actually it's my tone right now: P). The fact that I could not predict when I would kill and when it would disappear was a great advantage in my book. Predictable horror movies bore me. Now, I know that the story had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you do not notice them until long after the movie ends and you lie down in bed because of the fact that you've just seen a masterpiece on the move. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my favorite theatrical scores of all time, so I was very happy to know that Rob Zombie has not played it in his new version. Speaking of the new version, I read a very complete article about him and, now that I know that Mr. Zombie respects John Carpenter, I have high hopes for his version of this classic. This movie is excellent for any time you have a craving for spinal tingling, but it's the perfect addition, the opener, the ending, whatever it is for an All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)
