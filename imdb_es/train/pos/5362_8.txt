THE RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite film by Schwarzenegger. No, this is not 2001, but it is not meant to be. And the acting and the script here are not on par with other Arnie films like PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I argue that the IDEA behind this movie is one of the best on the big screen. A state-sponsored gaming program in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all types of weapons (runners are not equipped) to satisfy the public's lust for sport and blood. The ultimate prize for a winning runner: freedom. Or at least that's what the rules say. <br /> <br /> For a film with bloody death scenes so exaggerated and cheesy phrases, it really has a lot to say. Someone else has pointed out all the comments on culture / government presented in this movie, so I'm not going to go in here. Suffice it to say that if you can see beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie, you'll enjoy it a lot (especially if you're a big fan of SF with a lot of imagination). Like I said, it's not about being a serious art movie, but it's surprisingly layered for an 80-shot movie. The premise is taken from a short novel by Richard Bachman (also known as Stephen King), but it differs quite a bit from its original material, especially towards the end. (The book ends quite nihilistically, it goes without saying that this movie does not.) I enjoyed both, but I like the movie more. <br /> <br /> My favorite phrase: "I guess it's due to steroids."
