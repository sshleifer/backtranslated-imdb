I could see that this movie is great. He did not surprise himself when he was taking place for the truth, in this way, by himself, how the flight was flying to which he had no place, but it is only a conspiracy theory. True? <br /> <br /> I really liked watching this movie when I was a child. I am interested to know what happened if it turned out that such a flight was really taking place, and not because of a belief, because it denies logic and common sense. Who in the healthy senses, sent the children with the space shuttle in orbit. I really like to read about the subject, American and Soviet space programs. I know that some space shuttle missions continued to be provided by the CIA with the TOP SECRET clause, certainly these are just my ramblings, but who knows?
