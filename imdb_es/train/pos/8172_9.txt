I remember that I was terrified of the blood of the movies when I was younger, and little by little I became less, until I got tired enough, as I'm sure many other spectators have turned, so the rain of bloody movies produced in recent years it has entertained me, but it did not scare me or make me writhe. "The dentist" turned that around. <br /> <br /> The configuration seems simple: a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc inside the mouths and perhaps also the bodies. However, an intelligent twist is that the dentist is the protagonist of the film, so instead of being a bad one-dimensional type without a clear motivation, its development is the most extensive of all the characters and is very human and credible. In this way, the viewer feels sympathy for him and for his victims, and instead of waiting for justice to approach him, I found myself hoping that somehow he would find a way to cover his tracks and return to a life normal. <br /> <br /> What really "makes" a horror movie is violence. And "The Dentist" does it better than any other movie I can think of. First of all, the movie has a lot of tension, which is something that modern movies tend to lack. In one scene (), the dentist is emotionally disturbed and has to see a small child for the first time. When it reaches the child's mouth, you expect that, for the good of the dentist and the child, the meeting will end without injury. I will not ruin what happens. Second, when the gore arrives, it affects all the worst nerves. Once again, I will not give anything away. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a movie you've never heard of, it has flaws. Most important, it's exclusively for terror fans. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, taking place within a few days, we really do not have any background on the characters. And the tension decreases a bit during the end. But in reality, the fact that we even want to know the background of the characters is proof of how good it is, and most of the film is solid enough to forgive any small error in tension. <br /> <br /> It's strange, after years of being used to the movie Gore, to suddenly want to cover my eyes when I see blood. "The dentist" scared me and made me feel uncomfortable, and that's why he gets my full approval.
