This independent film looks at the lives of a group of people who take swimming lessons for adults in Connecticut. The plot is quite thin. What drives the film are the characters, excellently played by actors mostly unknown. Featured in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher who experiences marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who lights up as a stripper. The two actresses give natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter keeps the narrative moving at a rapid pace. The title of the film and the poster suggest something obscene, but this is a wonderful little comedy drama.
