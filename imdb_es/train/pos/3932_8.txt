In the same vein as his American Drums Along the Mohawk, John Ford captures the history of the United States in a way that is fictitious but very credible. Henry Fonda made three consecutive films at this time with Ford and the three are about a certain time and place, with an emphasis on the environment and the cultural environment. In Mohawk, the pioneer of the United States is in full bloom with the Americans defending themselves against the Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us the America of the 19th century; a moment when invention and creativity began to flourish and this nation was really becoming great. Among all was a young, tall and lanky lawyer from Illinois, called Abe Lincoln, and this fictitious movie his life as a lawyer, presaging the greatness he would later achieve. <br /> <br /> Fonda is excellent in this film, capturing the essence of what is considered the person of Lincoln, although nobody knows exactly what it was like at that moment. The sets and supporting cast also work well together and give a unique balance in Ford's picturesque dream, the American dream and its many forms. This is not a movie to be taken literally, but symbolically, showing that Lincoln was getting warmed by the events in his life that created his legacy. We even have some scenes between him and a young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how they ended up together, but that's not the point. I think this is simply a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, considered the best president in the United States. His calm and direct attitude was rare then and would be today. In fact, our government surely needs more men like him.
