It's hard to categorize the movie, maybe it's a cutting-edge spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good novel by Vonnegut, and without doubt one of his easiest novels to adapt to a feature film. The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The "independent" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than a large Hollywood studio that funds it. These days, I doubt that a clever novel like Mother Night gets the green light from the big Hollywood mills. And normally that's very bad, but not in this case. The mother's night has a closed address and a solid cast Nick Nolte, who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older, still has that "common man" personality that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. I always thought that he deserved something better than what came out of the entertainment industry. I guess making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with little time in the air is not the best of the roles, even if the television program becomes a minor phenomenon. Anyway, this movie is totally nice and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given the geopolitical realities of today, the premise of the novel may seem antiquated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be completely confused by the events that are unfolding (I am talking to you, American compatriots who are students and they are getting the lowest scores in the world). world industrialized in geography, history and gentleman knows what other topics!).
