Before seeing this, the subject discouraged me, but this is not your average triumph over the history of adversity. Although this is technically about blind Tibetan children who climb the mountain. Everest, there is much more than that. This film shows the very strong and often contradictory personalities of two very skilled blind adults who lead the children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is a climber / athlete of the American blind and Sabriye is a blind German academic who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. Both are exceptional in their own way, but they do not agree on what will really build trust in the children. Erik wants them to reach the top, while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a role model and to feel comfortable. The nuances are complicated and one walks away without really being sure who was right or if all the climbing was a mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they faced before arriving at school. The most moving thing for me was the story of Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up in the streets after his parents left him. I was able to see a full movie about his life and I was glad to know that thanks to the school, he now runs a successful small business with some of his classmates. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love this.
