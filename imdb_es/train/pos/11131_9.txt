I was reviewing a list of Oscar winners and I was surprised to see that this film surpassed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for the best movie in 1969. However, after seeing it really, it no longer surprises me. He was far ahead of his time in regards to his style, cinematography and flashback to help develop Joe Buck's character. <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing to me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a short film. I think Voight captured naivety and evil when it was provoked. The two scenes that really surprised me were after she received the blowjob in the theater and when the older man requested it. I think that when you look in the mirror, you are trying to see if it is really he who has done or is about to do something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. . Otherwise, it could have been typecast after the graduate. Anyway, this is considered a great of all time for a reason.
