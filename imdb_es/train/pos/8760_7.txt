It's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily like almost any other American movie, and then you'll be surprised when that does not happen. I like a happy ending as much as the next, but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic way, and I thought that Brokedown Palace did it very well. <br /> <br /> The end, basically with a friend sacrificing for the other, thus redeeming their previous bad behavior that led them to the situation in the first place, was very moving. I would almost rather have done it without the last line, which showed that she really did not do the writing she confessed, because that would have made the film more interested in the friendship between the two girls and less in the crime. Whether he did it or not, it was not that important. <br /> <br /> The story itself borders on clich√©, but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances. Very realistic, very captivating. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10.
