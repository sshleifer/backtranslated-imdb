Well you take O.J. Simpson, as an American soldier, became an American bus driver who decides to rescue his passengers just in case no one else is going to do it and Arte Johnson plays an absolutely direct role as a tour guide who does not know what to do but does not know what to do . I do not want to admit that they are in trouble and combine it with Lorenzo Lamas as one of the three bad baby-faced children who intend to kidnap an heiress and leave a bus full of people dying in the dessert and you must have action . And a lot of drama. They were all good, but seeing Lamas as the baddest of the bad guys really amazed me. He was too credible as the dominant bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but raped the women and humiliated the guy who was trying to stop him. Obviously, this was long before he cultivated his image as a good boy. And believe me, a 20-year-old Lorenzo in tight jeans that he really does not want to miss!
