"Citizen X" is the true story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in history. What makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place; the Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Mild Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Viktor Burakov (superbly played by Stephen Rea) is a forensic investigator recently promoted to the militia of the Soviet Union. Rostov oblast. Discover murders unsolved past and present, apparently by the same person. The murders are not resolved because no one has taken the trouble to properly investigate the evidence. He is forced to find and arrest the killer. His only tools are his dedication, skill and honesty. Its obstacles are corruption and the political ideology of the Soviet system that discourages the search for truth. His naivety would have led to failure if it were not for his boss, Colonel Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring a murderer to justice, even if the party's official line is "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. The locations and the sets are perfect recreations of the Soviet life of the last days. Randy Edelman's score is particularly good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with intensity and agility. This was a movie made by cable from HBO Films and has become a great resource for movies that would never otherwise be made.
