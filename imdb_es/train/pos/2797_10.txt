10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British doctor from India, currently in India. The word Beckham discouraged me, because I'm a big fan of Liverpool, and personally I think Owen is really great. As Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was DEAD for sure I would not see the film. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends, and I had an early flight in the morning, so I thought, "what the heck, let's watch the time watching this movie", because it was a show night. <br /> <br /> What a jerk he was. I should have seen this movie the day it was released. I guess using Beckham's name was to attract the audience's attraction (which in my case had been pushed back!), But I really can not think of a better title for the movie. <br /> <br /> AND Nagra, Knightley (drop dead gorgeous) and Rhys-Myers did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football, you do not like Manchester United (or England, really), this is definitely the I'm only 29 years old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a child of the heart, this movie has left "Star Wars" out of my number 1 position. Surprisingly, no There are many comments about this film from British Indians like me, I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
