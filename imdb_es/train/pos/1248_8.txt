['&quot;The Golden Child&quot; was Eddie Murphy&#39;s first film since his megahit &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;. And although it&#39;s not as good as &quot;Cop&quot;, it&#39;s a fun comic adventure. Murphy plays a seeker of lost children who are assigned a more unusual case. Its purpose: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie could have been titled &quot;Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Doom&quot; since parts of this film are presented as an adventure by Spielberg, like an Indiana Jones comedy. He has comedy with laughs, and adventure with special effects. Too much fun. <br /><br /> *** (of four)']
