New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and is rapidly fading away; When the movie begins, Caine's last Broadway game fails. Television critics make fun of Caine, and he gets drunk. Passing the Long Island Railroad, Caine lands in Montauk, instead of his residence in East Hampton. Upon arriving home, Caine is comforted by his wife Dyan Cannon (as Myra), an unfortunate heart patient. There, Caine and Mrs. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap," written by the cunning young man Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believe that Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the necessary blow to revive Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "The trap is ready for a funny jerk, who will do it". <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, the long Broadway hit of Ira Levin does not stray too far from her origin on stage. The cast is nice and the twists of the story are still fascinating. One thing that did not work (for me) was the end of the call; Surely, he played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; The proceedings are under way, but, in retrospect, the greeting that Reeve gives Caine at the East Hampton train station should have been simplified to a smiling "Hello". The location is not really East Hampton, but the windmill and the pond look similar. And, the ballyhooed love scene is surprisingly tepid. But, the game was so good, "even a gifted director could not ruin it". And, Mr. Lumet does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (03/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
