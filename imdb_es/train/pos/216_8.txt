Question: How do you steal an expert scene from experienced scene thieves Walther Mathau in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? answer: softly, without words, and with perfect timing like George Burns does here. <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about Vaudeville, but this is still a favorite movie, the two tracks are hilarious, the funny script, the direction and the rhythm. very well. Richard Benjamin is very funny like the heterosexual man: try to get to Burns through the window, etc. Even the small parts are great. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny scenes, Mathau ruining the commercial, Burns repeating his response as if he were senile ... <br /> <br /> A delight. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
