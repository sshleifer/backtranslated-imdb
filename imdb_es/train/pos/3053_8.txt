William H. Macy is at his nicest and most convincing place here as a hit man and loving father who wants to get out of the family business without angering his dominant parents. It covers much of the same territory as "The Sopranos" TV sets in terms of the crisis of half the life of a criminal issue (here also visits a psychiatrist), but it is still worth seeing thanks to a tense leadership of Brommel (I hope this guy directs the next one), an excellent script and all the great performances. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since "Fargo". Donald Sutherland is at his best as the dominant father. Tracy Ullman takes a surprisingly fascinating dramatic twist as Macy's wife. The young David Dorfman is excellent as the bright and sensitive son of Macy (many of his lines sound perfect and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (whom I usually find abominable) is convincing as the troubled young woman who catches Macy's eye. All this is marked by a score in movement and a clear rhythm that leads to a predictable but still powerful climax, and significant and moving consequences. This film deserved a much wider release, since I suspect that it would have connected with the public.
