Ida Lupino was one of the few women who broke the director's glass ceiling in Hollywood under the studio system. It is not surprising that he also addressed protofeminist issues that, when touched at all, were approached in such a cautious manner that it was rarely very clear what was being talked about. In Indignaci√≥n, she treats the rape and its consequences, and although throughout the short film it is known as a 'criminal assault', she leaves, for once, without a doubt what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (in her official debut) plays a secretary and bookkeeper in a large industrial plant; She lives with her parents, but is engaged to a bloated man (Robert Clarke), who just received a raise and now earns $ 90 per week. When leaving the plant after working late one night, she is being harassed. In the scene that follows? The best of the movie? She tries to escape from her persecutor in a maze of buildings and alleys, but fails. <br /> <br /> When she returns home, disheveled and shocked, the police can not get much out of her; She claims that she never saw her attacker (who was in charge of a snack truck outside the factory). Trying to pretend that nothing happened, she goes back to work but falls apart, thinking that everyone is watching her, judging her. She enters a state of escape, fleeing to Los Angeles on a bus but stumbling into a rest stop. <br /> <br /> When she wakes up at a strange ranch, she finds out that she was rescued by Tod Andrews, a young minister in an agricultural town in California. She lies about her identity and takes a job packing oranges. The two fall vaguely in love, but it is clear to Andrews that Powers keeps terrible secrets. When, at a company picnic, he takes a key and breaks the skull of Jerry Paris, who was trying to steal a kiss, the truth about his past comes to light ... <br /> <br /> It was a brave. The movie will be released in 1950, and that may explain and excuse some of its deficiencies. Lupino never regains the vertigo of the early assault scene, and the film wanders in bucolic and sentimental, ending with talent and didactics. Yes, Lupino had important information to impart, but he did not trust the narrative to speak for itself. His cast, nice, but insipid and generic, was not much help either, returning to the melodramatic postures or the homemade tranquility. But Outrage was a breakthrough, opening the way for a later discourse on what rape is really and what it really means for its victims.
