Broadway film actor and film director, John Cassavetes (of Rosemary's Baby) creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film. It stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert , Laura Johnson and there is a cameo by Peter Falk. The premise of the film: A stage actress and stage of aging (Gena Rowlands) reevaluates her life after a fanatic obsessed dies in a car accident while trying to get his autograph. The film has a slow pace and a dark, moody and terrifying quality. It has a cinematic look from the 60s and even reminded me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are what each successful actress has: she is getting old and will be useless in her career. In addition, she feels that she has lived a life that lacks true spirituality, humanity and merit. She has lived only for her career: she has no children, she does not do charitable works, etc. The gradual disintegration of his personality is the flesh of this film. She is falling apart. She is in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the tormented psyche of the character and acts quite well. She is a great actress and this 70's movie is a refreshing contrast with the often violent films of the time and with disaster movies or adventure thrillers. It's a film with a lot of deep emotion, but it has a cold and cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes was criticizing the films and actors of the 70's generation. Either that or this movie is a product of the 70s, which in itself was cynical in many ways: the deception of Nixon, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not very good, and this film is not very well known, it is a very disturbing movie. With disturbing moods. Congratulations to the underrated and deceased director Cassavetes who died in the late 80's.
