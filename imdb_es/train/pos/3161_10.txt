In fact, I did not start watching the show until it came to FX. I was bored and had nothing to do and I saw that the program replayed, so I decided to watch it. I was so upset that I had not seen the program when it was first aired on television. I loved the show so much! Finally, a show for everyone to enjoy. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were good shows, but not funny enough. They made silly jokes and laughed at things that were just stupid, but not at the Show of the 70s. That show from the 70s was hilarious, intelligent and very real. I think it was the best show that was done and I'm sorry it's over. Although I love this program, I think it should have ended in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. Last season was not the right one, Eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves. I still love this program and I hope television starts doing more programs like this one.
