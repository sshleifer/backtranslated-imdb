If you've never seen this movie and you like the old veteran actors, this is the movie for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin, with sunken cheeks and a wonderful voice that sang some great old songs. Michele Morgan, (Millie Pico) gave an outstanding performance with lots of dance numbers and musicals. Leon Errol, (Cyrus Drake) gave a great supporting role along with Victor Borge, (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) who played classical piano and comedy without slapping as he did in his career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was very happy to see him at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
