It was "The Night HE Came Home", warned posters of John Carpenter's horror classic. Set in a small town in the United States, Halloween focuses on the attempts of serial killer Michael Myers to track his sister Laurie Strode, and in the process eliminates all his friends quite brutally ... leaving poor Laurie to fight against Michael, apparently indestructible. This off-line plot inspired countless horror imitations throughout the 80s, 90s and continues to do so today, as well as a poorly received 2007 remake. The difference between them, and this, is simply that "Halloween" is the best. <br /> <br /> Made with a very modest and tight budget ... Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned it. the subgenre of "sexually promiscuous teens who are harassed by a knife / ax / chainsaw / brandishing psychopath".
