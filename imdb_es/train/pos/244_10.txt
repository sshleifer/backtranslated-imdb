I did not know what to expect from 'Ned Kelly', but I loved it. It was dark, dramatic and exciting. It also felt very authentic, I felt that I had been transported to the 19th century. I've never been a big fan of Heath Ledger, I've only seen him in teen-type movies, however, he's quite convincing in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how a very lively child became Australia's most famous killer. Naomi Watts is excellent in a supporting role as a lover of Kelly's society. Highly recommended, and that's from an Australian!
