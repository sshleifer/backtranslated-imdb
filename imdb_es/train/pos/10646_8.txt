This great film is composed mainly of documentary material that is currently on a DVD together with Prelude to War. The great American filmmaker and narrator Frank Capra made these films that draw attention simply and clearly to the main points that caused the Second World War and the rise of Hitler. <br /> <br /> All the children in the schools, all Americans should see these movies today because they are so appropriate. The story has been repeated again and again! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; The tactics used by the Nazis to infiltrate the countries through sympathizers and then by the communists and now by the Muslim terrorist groups, continue to work for the benefit of these evil groups. <br /> <br /> By sitting down and letting Hitler start in 1935. aggressive: France, the United States and England caused more than 50 million deaths. The Americans, the French and the British today would happily let Hitler do exactly the same thing even though we should have learned from history what happens when you let the dictators break the treaties. <br /> <br /> These great films may be too simplistic for fans of the history of World War II. They do not count the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because the moment the United States joined them, they fought against Hitler. This film tells the facts and reasons that led to the terrible war.
