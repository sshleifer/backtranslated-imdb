Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this in the cinema at age 4 and I have very good and vivid memories of it. Seeing this as an adult allows one to pick up references that are well above the head of the target audience, such as the drill bit in which Jimmy's gray witch wig tears off and Witch Hazel (Cass) mocks "DID YOU KNOW? that had brown roots! " Of course, it is strongly influenced by the culture of floral power of the time and, in a way, quite progressive. The Different track, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers about being oneself, not running with the package and appreciating what is different about oneself. This could be a hymn to the gay community, it should be, a great clue. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are great as witches, and the cast of Living Island gives it all in the confines of their character costumes (includes Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names) ). There's a LOT of exaggerated action in this movie: there's really nothing subtle, and when little Jack Wild has to express his concern for the kidnapped residents of Living Island, it's really little more than shouting. This is drama and comedy with a palette. Although I think about it, although I could never stand the flute. <br /> <br /> I love the soundtrack, especially the mentioned Different, but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild are playing If I could. In addition, it is now on a CD of tasteful people at The Records in London. See here for more information: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
