I saw this movie in 1969, when it premiered for the first time at the Cameo Theater in South Beach, now the famous Crowbar night club. It was the last year of the Wild 60s and this movie really came home. Has it all; The generation gap, the sexual revolution, the search for success and the conflict between following the "traditions" of the family and those of finding their own way through life. <br /> <br /> It was a fast-paced and very enjoyable movie. . Vegas was at its height, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughter, conflicts, romance and even a happy ending. A very pleasant moment about everything. <br /> <br /> The poster of this film rests on the wall of my room. I look at it and go back in time; A moment of my youth and my times with my dad, a great moment in my life.
