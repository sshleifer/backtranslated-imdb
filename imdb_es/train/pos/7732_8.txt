The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric had a fantastic performance as "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. Far superior to "The Grifters", which was a good movie, this film really stayed true to the roots of the pulp novel / fiction from which the story emerged. I recommend this movie to all the fans of black cinema.
