Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it's a series made by fans, available only on the web, and mainly has friends and neighbors who have computer programs and video cameras and sewing machines for the home, as Mickey & Judy once put it, A program. It is definitely friends and neighbors, you can say. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people you have seen, or the youngest or the thinnest? Do some of them stumble through their lines as if they were walking on marbles? some of them have thick accents, or they just do not seem to speak well in the first place, which makes it virtually impossible to understand a single lonely word they are saying. Still, you have to admit that, for all that these friends and neighbors have gathered, it's really fun to watch. Yes, some of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, it's a bit strange (although you have to admit that it's also great) to see two Starfleet males kiss each other (although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on). Yes, you shudder a bit when you clearly cite ST: TOS, TNG, other programs and movies, or when you hear the Galaxy Quest theme at the beginning and end of each program. Good. We can overcome that. Why? The graphics are first class. Better than almost anything you've seen. And sometimes, one or two shows really stand out in the story? Some of them are really tearful tears. <br /> <br /> Is Hidden Frontier a totally guilty pleasure in every sense of the word? but you have to give credit to the people involved where the credit is owed. It takes a lot of effort to make a production of this magnitude. People, sets, costumes, graphics? It is a great effort on the part of many people. We look, we come back, and we thank you.
