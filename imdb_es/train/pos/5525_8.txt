Much of the problem that many people have with this movie is that they seem to think that the story should have been more entertaining (ignoring it is based on a true story) or a movie that glorifies Che (who really does not). ). This film is very close to the definitive biography of Jon Anderson in Che and makes the story correct. Soderburgh does an excellent job of setting the mood for the debacle of Bol's Bolivian adventure. It really gives you the impression of the total timidity and the bewilderment of the Bolivian peasant before the revolutionary ideas of Che or the difficulties that his men faced with hunger and the land. I'm sorry I got the attention of movie fans, but that's how it happened. So do not go into this movie waiting for a shoot of Rambo, it's a real story!
