Here is the proof of why Mary Pickford was "America's love". In this rather complex drama, Mary plays the young daughter of an illegal occupant who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "climbers". The scenes in which they steal a kiss and fall in love are simply lovely. She is even willing to bathe. The fact that Mary could perform this role at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature (5 '). <br /> <br /> Tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges. He does it with sperm that is not seen in many heroines of the time. Tess makes a good hit and is not afraid to fight with anyone. Why she agrees to help the daughter from the top of the hill is beyond me, but she sacrifices her own happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's close-ups are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Jean Hersholt, born in Denmark, is simply wonderful as the villain. The scene where you mistreat a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables (or whatever) at the movie screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) had worn a beard, would he have been a rival to the model used in those Uncle Sam World War I recruiting posters? He loves you! <br /> <br /> Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow at first, it is worth investing in your time to see the piece or pure 'Americana'. The film highlights the options available to all of us, which include making someone else happy and what it is to be a true Christian. Recommended.
