Oh, those clever Italians. It is not the first time that they base a film on original material without the permission or knowledge of the author of the novel, in this case. Of course, this is not something that is typically Italian but it was done a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they could get away with it. The editors of James M. Cain managed to keep this film off US screens until 1976, but, nonetheless, the film itself has become a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as good to see as the 1946 American. Version but it's a great movie though. This, of course, is not at all because the film is a great story, it is intriguing and provides the film with some great and realistic characters. It follows the novel very closely and, therefore, is almost the same as other film versions of its history, and of course as a difference that was established in an Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Leave it to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it. These first dramas always have a very realistic feeling about them and, therefore, they also involve a lot of seeing them. Unfortunately, the movie lost some of its power towards the end, when the movie began to feel a bit prolonged and crawled in parts. The movie could have easily ended 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> However, I really do not have much more negative to say about this movie. It is simply one greatly made, based on an equally large and strong source material. It was an impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct some of the largest and most memorable Italian dramatic films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
