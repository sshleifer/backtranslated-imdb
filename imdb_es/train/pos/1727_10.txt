['The Wooden Horse is a very intelligent film about a very intelligent and successful escape plan drawn up by the British prisoners of war during the Second World War. It acts superbly with an ironic sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid languages of Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are wonderful as the two heroes. The direction is tense and fast everywhere. Highly recommended']
