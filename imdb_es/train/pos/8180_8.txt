This is an entertaining movie. It could actually make you feel uncomfortable since you are not a psychopath or undead sociopath, it is your usual doctor. How scary is that? She got some good actors and actresses in this movie, although some were not appreciated as Virginya Keehne as Sarah. Ken Foree, whom you might recognize by Rob Zombie Devils Rovers and Halloween (2007), plays our detective on the track of Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Benson) of the schizoid. This short and brief summary is as follows: Dr. Alan Feinstone, a guy who has a sexy wife, a good house and is a great dentist that everyone loves. Until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner. Then he begins to hallucinate that his patients' teeth are all rotten and that patients are his wife when he starts going crazy in this thriller. But before that, good boy.
