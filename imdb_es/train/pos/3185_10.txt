dear story ........ I voted ten against all the averages for my age and sex ... not so much comedy (compared to a movie that I almost wet myself) although quite funny. I'm not a fan of musicals, so it's probably too much for me, but they give you time to have a drink or a drink without missing anything important. Maybe a 1950s version of when Harry met Sally? Ahab no, not really, but if that is among your top ten as if it were mine, you will like this movie. Actually, it only leaves you with a warm and confused feeling, which reminds you how romance could and should be, something to shoot for. my summary describes it best in very few words ... pretty charming
