This probably will not be voted as the best comedy of the year, too many coincidences and plots. However, we are talking about a movie in which a hitman and a white bread salesman become friends, so some quirks should not be a big surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, James Bond disappeared from wood (a role in which he wasted). If you can maintain this kind of quality, I hope you continue doing comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan's straight man. I read some negative comments here about Hope Davis, but I thought she was pretty good as a housewife with a dark side buried deep. There are many good laughs when Brosnan makes his way and some scenes where I almost die laughing. My father (a consultant) almost loses it when Julian describes himself as a "facilitator". Like "Grosse Pointe Blank", another popular comedy, humor can be very dark. If you are in that, prepare to enjoy.
