Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break. Meanwhile, he works as a telephone consultant for a Manhattan psychic hotline. One day, most unfortunate, your apartment building burns. Parker and his cat come out alive, but now they are trapped in the arduous task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. He tells Parker that a lady, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but will only accept a gay man. Since Parker is heterosexual but the price is right, he decides to pretend he is gay. Samantha likes him from the beginning and welcomes him as his new cohabiter. But, poor Parker. Sam is adorable, intelligent and very desirable. How can he keep his true nature under control? Also, does not Sam have a successful boyfriend-businessman anyway? This is a sweet, nice and fun movie with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Naturally, the plot is a series of "how can I continue with this trick" scenes, with Sam asking Parker for shampoo while she is bathing or begging to be put to bed when she receives bad news. In addition, it is necessary for Parker to produce his own "fake" gay partner, Boris, when Sam insists on fixing it with a man she knows. Hopefully, the gay community will not find this too offensive, since this viewer thought that most of the problems were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. For a small-scale film, the costumes, the sets and the camera work were also very good. Therefore, if you love those funny love stories, get this soon. You'll like what you see, I know.
