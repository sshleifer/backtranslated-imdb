A very good wartime movie that shows the effects of the war on a child from hometown who loses his sight in Guadalcanal and must return home and readjust with the help of family and friends. An excellent cast of actors helps to make this film very entertaining. The role of Eleanor Parker as the bride was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has great innocence for her in this movie. Ann Doran's role was just as satisfying as all her small supporting roles. I especially like Philadelphia's aura hometown before the war. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the war scene in Guadalcanal really showed the horror that our soldiers face during this epic battle. A well-deserved film and one that should not be forgotten.
