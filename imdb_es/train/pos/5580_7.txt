The young and beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately he can not satisfy her sexually and ignores her. Frustrated, she goes home and plans to divorce. Then, one day, it is fleeting submerging in a lake in the middle of the forest. Her horse gallops with her clothes ... and she runs after her! She meets the young and very handsome Adam (Aribert Mog). They make love and she realizes that this is the man she wants. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER !!!! Naturally, since this was done in 1933, she must be punished for her sin, so it leads to a tragic end. END OF TERMINATING THE SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This horrified people in 1933, but it is quite tamed by today's standards. The naked swimming of Lamarr shows nothing, and when he runs after the horse totally naked, it is shown in a very remote way or is covered by branches and others. There are only a few small shots of her breasts. Also, when she has sex with Mog, nothing is shown but her face, but you see her reaching an orgasm. These scenes were considered quite extreme in their day and were completely eliminated from the American release. Now they are back. This movie would be easily fixed with a PG-13 now. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside episodes of shock, this is fine. It is very well filmed and there is almost no dialogue. Except for the musical score, this could be a silent image. Luckily, all the actors are good, especially Lamarr and Mog, and they are so attractive that they simply run out of breath when they see them. In addition, the sequence in which they make love is easily one of the best recorded and performed sequences I've seen in a movie. The scenes with sexual symbolism (there are quite a few) are unfortunately quite obvious today. In fact, I started laughing at once! <br /> <br /> So, excellent direction, beautiful images, attractive actors, good acting, but I was not fooled by that. I found the movie in slow motion (the beautiful images do not make me an image), somewhat boring, obvious, static and had a negative end. I can live with the end, but it does not justify the other problems I had with him. Also, the final sequence is REALLY strange, and it's out of place. So I admire this movie more than anything else. It was well done and I would recommend it but with caution. A lot of people seem to love this movie, so I'm in a minority. Use your own judgment.
