1936 was the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers. Is your second film for RKO that year the third film in this collection? Mark Sandrich 'Follow The Fleet'. This time, Astaire feels terribly uncomfortable like Bake Baker, a permit sailor who has just stumbled in the sordid cafe on the shore where Sherry Martin (Rogers) is piling nothing romantic and romantic in everyone's ears. Yes, have you guessed? They are hot for each other one more time. Only this time Sherry's single sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens all the good romance by falling in love with Bake's stocky sailor companion, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a type of use and expulsion, forcing Sherry to reconsider her opinion of all boaters in general. Irving Berlin lends immense classes to the proceedings with its classic and elegant score, which includes the standards 'Let Yourself Go', 'I'm Puting All My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'; the latter is a divinely inspired sketch about suicide that becomes another pas deux immediately recognizable and sublime for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transfer in 'Follow The Fleet' is a bit weaker. The gray scale stays well balanced, but now it is a bit thick and does not have as much tonal variation as the previous titles. The grain is still present. Touching are the artifaunes related to√≥digos. Once it has adapted to the slightly dense and sometimes softer image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this era. The audio is cute but very well balanced. The extras include a featurette, a theatrical trailer and a short theme, but interestingly? No audio comments Considering the importance of this film in the general canon of Astaire / Rogers, this is an uncharacteristic supervision of Warner Home Video.
