This was a great movie with a good cast, all of them hitting on all the cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is at her best, well, there's nothing better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always underestimated, was even better. He should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is with one aspect of the script. None of the characters recognized that the dead daughter was not always a good person. And neither does her mother, played by Keaton. At one point she breaks a promise she made to a character so as not to reveal that he had been sleeping. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said that the film had a "political agenda". That is somewhat disconcerting to say. There was no policy at all in this movie.
