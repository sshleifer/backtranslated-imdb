**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in books and never forgotten <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see <br /> <br /> *** = A solid, worthwhile piece, very entertaining <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 = A good movie, but there are some unequal elements or notable failures <br /> <br /> ** = Can be considered good in some areas, but this work has serious problems or is restricted by unavoidable elements that are considered inevitable (eg, gender) <br /> < br /> * 1/2 = Mainly a lot of nothing caused by moments that are worth it <br /> <br /> BOMB = Not of visible quality <br /> <br /> - Kalifornia = *** <br /> <br /> - Not classified (for violent material, considerable sexuality and language) <br /> <br /> I rented this movie waiting for a celebration of Brad Pitt's face with summer success quality, but I Pleasantly surprised and disappointed. This really is more of a drama, and very bleak for that ... I remember some emotionally intense Duchovny voiceover. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays his possible less sexy movie with surprising talent. Who began as a hopeless but harmless "white garbage", realized that he was a violent and disturbing alcoholic with a tangled mind. During some of the last stages of the film, I found it difficult to keep seeing it; It was unpredictable and terrifying. This is very good for writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is full of strange and sensational scenes that made me hold my breath no less than once, and I do not mean the action scenes. I mean the dialogue scenes so brilliantly designed that I actually grimaced and gasped at what I was seeing. It was like watching a rhinoceros and a lion tucked into a cage and watching as they bit each other to death. Once again, I am very impressed with the screenwriter (s); Whoever it is, he did the impossible: mixed oil and water. <br /> <br /> I also really enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. It is so rare that this talented young actress appears in these days that when she does it is a joy. Some of his moments in this movie made me cry. I want to say that. The emotions that this girl can awaken in your head are incredible, and I remember clearly having blurred eyes in some occasions. <br /> <br /> I almost feel like I'm cheating on the quality of the craftsmanship that the filmmakers have shown. only giving "KALIFORNIA" a rating of ***. But the dark feelings that it awakens are too powerful and depressing to elevate them. Although I think everyone should see this movie. I really do it.
