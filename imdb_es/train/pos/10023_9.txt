After seeing several films of Villaronga, I had a pretty clear opinion about him: he concentrated too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting the rhythm of the film. That's why, although he has good reviews, his films never attracted the attention of the public. In ARo, it follows the same line, but it really improved the tempo, especially at the end of the movie. Frankly speaking, I slept during the first part, because although the first part gives the necessary information, it is very slow. However, the second part is absolutely wonderful and makes the whole movie the best film made by Villaronga. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
