As a great source of money for RKO Radio, Bombardier stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as coaches in a school for bomber pilots. O'Brien and Scott discuss teaching methods, while their students compete for the affections of Anne Shirley. O'Brien's methods prove solid during a bombing of Tokyo. Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese, but Scott, the mortally wounded, manages to set fire to a gas truck, providing a perfect target for his fellow bombers. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic war movies, with moments of subtle commotion (the death of apprentice Eddie Albert) alternating with scenes from the ridiculous melodrama "Yellow Peril" (the Japanese literally hiss between their teeth while torturing the helpless Americans) ). Although it can not help but seem antiquated, Bombardier is still an entertaining propaganda effort (the film sometimes appears wrongly as the debut of Robert Ryan, who had been appearing before the cameras since 1940. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film, contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
