The movie is simply funny ... maybe more fun for those of us who were young and "Los Ramones" fans at the time the movie was made. I've seen the movie over and over again, alone and with friends, and it's still fresh and fun. At the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless, and the boredom of high school students with the heavy work of some classes is just as timeless. <br /> <br /> And, the movie has some gem lines / scenes ... references to how our "permanent record" in high school will follow us throughout life. (Let me assure you that I've been out of high school for a few years and you're not following me) ... the famous "static" line ("I'm getting a little static" ... "Not as much as you're going to get" , as Director Togar approaches) ..... the school board member who is so decrepit that the nurses attend ... the Nazi Hall monitors love a "body search" ... ... Principal Togar announced "I give you the final solution" and recorded the records of the Ramones (note: the records were what happened before the CDs) ... and, of course, Joey Ramone noticed: "Things they have probably changed since they kicked us out of high school, "followed by Togar asking" Do your parents know you are Ramones? "<br /> <br /> Just a tip ..... do not look where you are. stars are now ... Joey Ramone sadly died young. Dey Young, who was one of the main hotties in the film, today reminds us that we are all old ... PJ Soles' career never advanced as we could have hoped ......... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the other students, Apparently she appeared only in this movie (one of my male friends dies for her every time we watch the movie), although I submit that her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So, look and enjoy ... do not think ... just have fun!
