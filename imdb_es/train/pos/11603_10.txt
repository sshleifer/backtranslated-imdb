The first time I saw it, I got half, but I saw it and later I knew it was a Salem witch trial. They focused on Sara Good's family. SHE is famous for cursing a priest who came true. In the film she shows her daughter Dorcas and her husband, the spirit of Ann Putnam. Sara's husband comes to the future and looks for this girl to redeem her soul. What does happen at the end of the movie. Dorcas is represented as a witch at 5 years of age who is burned at the stake. What will never happen Ann Putnam saves her from the flames. The girl is safe, she goes to the tomb of Ann Putnam to see that it is not empty, but at the beginning it is because she accuses her of witchcraft and leaves her to die of burning. Now that Ann Putnam saves her, her spirit has been redeemed, and she is not an outcast from society for the Salem witch trials.
