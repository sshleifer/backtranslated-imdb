Except for an uncomfortable scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and charming undercurrent of adult cynical wit that makes its way into the audience, as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this epic fairy. Except for one of the scenes of Robert DeNiro that are not seen smoothly and are not synchronized with the tone of the rest of the film, this exuberant romantic fairy tail has a great sense of narration and strong magic and fine balance between The adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual mood are well done. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight of ten stars.
