['The first time I went to see The Shining I was expecting a decent movie for what I had heard and I really liked Stanley Kubrick&#39;s other work, but when I started watching it, it was much better than I thought. Sometimes, I felt ridiculously uncomfortable and could not take my eyes off the screen. There&#39;s still something very disturbing about everything in the movie. Now, some people do not like Kubrick&#39;s version of The Shining, since it does not completely follow Stephen King&#39;s book, but in my opinion, both the Kubrick version and the miniseries and the book are great. Jack Nicholson offers incredible performance. they are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies are over and then watch The Shining.']
