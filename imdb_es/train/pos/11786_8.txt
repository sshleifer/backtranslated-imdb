This is almost typical of Lynch. However, what makes this movie a little unusual for Lynch is the fact that he looks very raw, almost amateurish. But I think Lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of the surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, there are many typical Lynch motifs, such as: floating camera work; disturbing music; long breaks (unbearable); hanging curtains; the dim lights become darker at a slow (almost imperceptible) pace; extreme close-ups; issues of women in trouble; The characters who know how to cope, are not passionate, all who know face the characters who are distressed, temporarily alien, in the dark and so on ... <br /> <br /> The performances are great and the short film It is stimulating. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything to the interpretation. Many questions remain unanswered and this ignites the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort by Lynch. I just hope he makes some shorts, more in line with his Sony Playstation 2 commercials. They were inspired.
