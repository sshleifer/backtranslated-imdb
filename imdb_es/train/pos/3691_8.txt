The whole is not even close to the sum of the parts. No problem. This film presents an alignment of some of the most creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast. The segments are designed around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends there. Actually, considering that the approach of the theme of all these different directors takes so many forms, it is incredible that we can feel that we are still watching the same movie. No great effort has been made to turn it into an integral whole. This buffet has many excellent ingredients, I am glad that no one has tried to put them in one dish.
