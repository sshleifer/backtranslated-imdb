The first time I saw this movie was when I was a freshman in high school, and the movie has stayed with me through the years. It is not about the soundtrack, nor the cinematography, nor even the dialogue and the bad performance, it is about the educational purpose, and the underlying message is the most important one. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and you're still in high school, and it's not really bad either, but it's a problem. Tons of girls who knew they now have children, and I guess they never saw this great movie, and if they did, they clearly did not understand the message behind it all. It's about not taking a risk when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It is not a myth You do not necessarily lose your dreams, but they have to take a back seat in your future because you have to first think of a child. <br /> <br /> This movie has a clear message behind: JUST SAY NO!
