Multiple massive chills down the spine! I'm surprised there are people who did not like it! I saw him at 10 in the morning and I still got scared! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror movies! By screaming out loud, I'm 22 !!! I mean, it's okay, the voice acting, it's not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish. But the genuine look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the beginning, hitting you again and again with implacable, relentless and terrifying scenes! So many clich√©s, but none stop surprising / scare! You know what comes, comes, comes, BOO! and you keep jumping out of the chair. Take a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend and do not look at him at night! Congratulations to the Japanese!
