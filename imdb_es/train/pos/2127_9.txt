Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate, but nowadays it is deceptive. The genre has sadly deteriorated into clichés, too focused on making the main couple meet and with very little room for the environment and other stories, which makes it so formidable and predictable. <br /> <br /> The store just around the corner does not suffer from these diseases: it manages to create a recognizable atmosphere in central / eastern Europe and has a strong cast in addition to the (also strong) nominal tracks ; I avoid using the words 'supporting cast', as for example Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) has a central role in the film and his story is equally or more important than romance. <br /> <br /> The 1998 film You Have Got Mail borrowed the idea of ​​the "anonymous correspondence friend" from this film and, therefore, has been cataloged as a new version. This is not correct and, in fact, it is unfair to the new movie: it shares the genre and takes an element of the plot, but that's it.
