This movie is about a fictional telenovela. It is very fast and fun. Saying anything else would ruin the movie. There are several plots and subplots in the movie. This movie has a cast with the hottest stars of today. All of them give above the best performances. This is one of my favorite movies of the year 1991. Soapdish is perfect for the fans of the daytime soap opera or the primetime telenovela! If you see soap, go to this movie, it's hilarious!
