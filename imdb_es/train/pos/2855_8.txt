An entertaining and substantive film, Non-Stop has made meritorious comparisons with "Run Lola Run". The film develops rapidly in a chase sequence, during which viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and dream sequences. Persecution does not serve as an accelerated climax, but as a journey that makes up the majority of the film. During the "race" we see that the characters grow and forget momentarily their sad lives, the "macho" roles they have assumed, and, finally, they forget why they started running in the first place. Like the fight, it provided a "clarity" to the characters of "Fight Club". Execution provides the characters in this film with a means to get away from the false values ​​that we all allow society to create for us. His career serves as a way to really savor life from a cloudless perspective, and all three find some level of clarity and joy in the process. <br /> <br /> My appreciation and enjoyment only slightly weakened at the end of the film, where instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to reinterpret those male false roles that I thought had escaped on his journey. <br /> <br /> However, the only real problem with this movie is that it was not distributed outside Japan before.
