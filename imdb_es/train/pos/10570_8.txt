It's hard to say what is at the top, the charm and energy of James Cagney or the excesses of Busby Berkeley's three big shows at the close. I give him a tie, with Footlight Parade, one of the funniest and fastest musicals of the early thirties. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds enormously to the storyline of good character. <br /> <br /> And what is the story line? This is Chester Kent (Cagney) who produces musicals, and who is now almost out of business when commentators take over. Begin to do Prologues, live musical entertainment that is offered on stage before a movie begins. He comes up with the idea of ​​making bigger and more, moving them around the country. It is a fireball and ideas, and you need all the ideas you can get to continue producing these things without rest. But a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his intelligence secretary, loves him but is too busy to notice; an office girl with round glasses with a black frame (Ruby Keeler) wants to have the opportunity to dance; his wife appears saying that she did not divorce him after all; a golden seeker blonde is placing her hooks on it; His teammates are cheating him ... My God, what's next? All this may seem a lot to digest, but everything happens fast, with Cagney bouncing, strutting, walking, making orders, barking orders and occasionally, until the last big number when everything is singing and dancing, taking a step. or two just to show how it's done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's put a program, gang" we have "We need to build three programs in three days, so close the doors and start rehearsing." These three superprologues will present 40 choirs, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty Kent units in luxury movie theaters ... the entire Apollo cinema circuit! Exhaustion threatens, your feet hurt, but all those unbilled choirs in tiny costumes (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour, you can quickly spot Sothern, but Lamour is more generic) stay on course, ring their hearts, laugh and chat, and they look remarkably bland. . <br /> <br /> And then the curtains are raised as each Prologue is presented in separate movie theaters, one after the other on the same night, and the owner of the Apollo circuit will determine that night if will save Chester's skin or not. <br /> <br /> The first place is "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a production number of 9 minutes that has a lot of lust, with brides and grooms (some may even be married), rooms and beds, and doors with "Do Not Disturb" signs. <br /> <br /> Then to the next theater and 11 minutes of "By a Waterfall" that probably caused Warner Brothers accountants to worry about bankruptcy. This number is so excessive: dozens of swimmers, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with slides, a giant pool, you would never think there was a Depression. Berkeley takes out all his tricks (timing, human patterns, legs and arms doing all kinds of precision things) and does it in the water, with a lot of underwater photographs looking up. The girls are safe from the game. They approach smiling with water in their eyes and they still hit their marks. Everything must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has a couple of quick shots in the water, is the only one who looks a little cautious. <br /> <br /> And finally, the overwhelming end ... 11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler to "Shanghai Lil", with all kinds of girls in bars and their customers, something unusual in which the races mix. There's Cagney and Keeler dancing in the bar, dancing at a table, Cagney fighting. There are what look like fifty or sixty Marines on the march, jumping from one side to another, rifles thrown and trapped. So ... this is true ... a human image of Franklin Roosevelt and the eagle NRA. This may be the only Hollywood musical production that has featured Roosevelt, a large federal agency and a group of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> That's entertainment, folks. It's great! <br /> <br /> Of course, Chester Prologs get the big contract and Nan gets Chester. The film is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is as endearing as she stomps her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her. Joan Blondell makes us forget many Hollywood women who could have been more beautiful but had much less wit and personality. However, the film belongs to Cagney, who grabs it and shakes it, and Berkeley, a man for whom it was never too much.
