I saw this movie at a time when I was timidly playing with the idea of ​​moving to my own apartment and starting life on my own. Maybe that's the reason why I took it so seriously. He totally believed in the psychological degradation of the poor character within a Paris of sites of perpetual construction, dust, misery, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decadence. I give all the credit to Polanski's art in his direction, his way of playing and his inescapable script, but I fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by the cognac in the office of the theater manager. Luckily for me, my life on my own was not as disastrous as it is (until now), but I have always maintained a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and immerse himself totally in (false) reality he is trying to convey. In short, man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. This film is the sum of many, many examples of great acting and great casting. As some performances were done in English (the scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most of the other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I recommend him whole-heartedly, is that they are bilingual. , to change the audio from French to English and vice versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on the Paramount DVD. This film is part of the so-called "apartment building trilogy" by Polanski, which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" has not yet achieved a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. It goes without saying that the three movies would be a great box set.
