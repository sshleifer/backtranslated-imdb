Kimi wa petto is a beautiful story about a girl who one day finds a child inside a box that is outside her apartment one day. She decides to bring him and fix his cuts. Then he leaves a note for him to eat some food that he did and then he goes home because he had to go to work. When she arrives home, however, she finds that he is still there. He tells her that he wants to live there with her as a brother or a cousin. Desperate to get her to leave, she tells him that if she becomes his pet, then he could stay. And as a pet, she says he would not have rights and would do what she said. (Not in that perverted way!) To his surprise, he accepts and since then he is known as Momo, his pet.
