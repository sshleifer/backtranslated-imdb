I think a lot of people did not rate the film, NOT because of the lack of quality. But he did not follow the standard hollywood formula. Some of the conflicts are not resolved. The ending is too real for others, but the journey provided by the rich characters and the long list of supporters is stimulating and very entertaining. Even cinematography is excellent given the urban environment, the management is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is a 10 in my book, this movie will take you to places where the normal and expected script of Hollywood will not. They took some risks and did some different things. I think it worked well, I'm deliberately trying to avoid any direct reference to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer, not accepting another person's interpretation.
