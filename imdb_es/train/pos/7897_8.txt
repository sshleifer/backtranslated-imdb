['At first glance, this movie does not seem like a great movie in particular. After all, Bette Davis&#39; films with only 166 votes in IMDb and a rating of 6.5 must be pretty bad. But the movie turned out to be a charming and original surprise. <br /><br /> At first, you would expect this to be a typical 30&#39;s average movie with a love story formulated, but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story, which also helps make this movie very enjoyable. watch. <br /><br /> The story is taken by its two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. They were aided by a cast of mostly fun characters, but the movie involves mostly around them both. His character is involved in a very unusual and intelligent written love story that also works with humor. It makes this movie a lovely little comedy to watch, which is perfectly entertaining. <br /><br /> The film is quite short (of little more than an hour), which means that the story does not waste time on arguments, development and unnecessary characters. It also makes the film faster, which helps make this film perfectly visible by today&#39;s standards. Maybe it makes the movie a bit simple sometimes, but this never goes at the expense of your entertainment or fun. <br /><br /> A lovely simple and nice romantic comedy that deserves to be seen for more! <br /><br /> 8/10']
