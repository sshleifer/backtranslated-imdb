['Diagnosis The murder has been shown most of the afternoons of the working days on BBC1, since 10 years ago I used to see him while he was sick at school. I know I should not enjoy it in the same way that I should not enjoy murder. &#39;but I&#39;m totally addicted to both and I even have the DVD-sets ... OK, I know that&#39;s sad! <br /><br /> Dick Van Dyke takes the program while playing Dr. Mark Sloan, a physician at Community General Hospital in Los Angeles who is also a police advisor to the Los Angeles Police Department. His son Steve (Barry van Dyke, Dick&#39;s son in real life) is a police officer. Who needs his father&#39;s help in many suspicious deaths. <br /><br /> Along with the trip is Dr. Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley), the pathologist resident in the General Community, and during the first couple of seasons she had Scott Baio playing Dr. Jack Stewart, who went up and left the series in 1995 with the hope of going bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was, he has not done anything remarkable since ... and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies ... Oh, God my own! ! <br /><br /> Anyway, Dr. Jack Stewart was replaced by Dr. Jesse Travis, younger, played by Charlie Schlatter, who got into the shoes of Baio quite comfortably. <br /><br /> The series is highly unlikely, but what is not the Whodunit series? (Murder she wrote: Wherever Jessica goes, someone ends up dead, or The Dowling Mysteries of Father Dowling about an Assassin who solves a Priest with a nun companion) <br /><br /> The series was much lighter until 1997, this is because it had a cast of support that included the clumsy administrator of the hospital, Norman Briggs, played by Michael Tucci, along with the secretary of Nurse &amp; Mark, Dolores, played by Delores Hall . After 1997, both characters were no longer included. The series became a funnier affair with a bigger budget, some episodes included a lot more action, an episode in which the whole Hospital is exploited. <br /><br /> This was a family program for Van Dyke&#39;s, because in addition to Dick&#39;s Son Barry, he also had Dick&#39;s daughter and all of her grandchildren who appeared in several episodes. <br /><br /> As the series progressed it became a bit silly, an episode I remember about Dick van Dike playing his whole family, which was a little out of the ordinary, but in general &#39;Diagnosis Murder&#39; was a really good TV show that He had many good guest stars. <br /><br /> Since ending this program in 2001, Dick and Barry have appeared together again in the series &#39;MURDER 101&#39; of television movies created by The Hallmark Channel, practically following the same path, and they are still nice. Dick, who is now about 80 years old, does not seem to change much, and seems to be working to the end. <br /><br /> TV SHOW **** OUT OF *****']
