['I really enjoyed the meeting! I would have scored a 10 if they had had &quot;Hassie&quot; and &quot;Little Luke&quot;. They did not even mention where they are today or why they did not participate in the meeting. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance. <br /><br /> Anyway, I&#39;m glad that TNN ran the series again. I had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to record the whole series (I may have missed some episodes). Jenny Hanahan']
