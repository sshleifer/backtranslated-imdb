"Moonstruck" is a small and charming film directed by the excellent narrator, Norman Jewison (In the heat of the night, Fiddler on the Roof, The Hurricane). The movie is great on many levels. It shows a good part of Italian culture, has a touching romance and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy. <br /> <br /> One of the things that I liked most about the movie was the unconventional aspect of the actors. Nicolas Cage looks positively strange to most of the film, and Cher ... well, Cher always looks a little weird. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a fun and easy to recommend movie. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
