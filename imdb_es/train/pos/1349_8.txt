RKO had a reputation for doing folksy, homemade pieces of Americana. <br /> <br /> Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) had been in movies since she was a little girl. By 1933, she was in limbo, having played Ann Dvorak as a child in "Three on a Match" (1932) and a "flower girl" in both "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" both in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr I remembered Anne's work from a previous movie and that's how she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. The memorable stories are there: Lady of Shallot in a leaky boat, the "stolen" brooch, the "red hair" incident. Anne was so suited to the role of the talkative and comforting orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity, her eagerness to please and also her fiery temper. O.P. Heggie was wonderful as the understanding that Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley were fine as the signature Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who had also been in movies as a child, was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved that she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series, it was Mrs. Barry.
