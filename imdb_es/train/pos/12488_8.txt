I'm not picky about horror movies, and I'm willing to watch almost any of them. That does not mean that I am willing to see many of them again, or that I will not have criticism for them. This movie is spooky, and it's very well made. In fact, I think this movie would be an excellent double bill with Session 9. <br /> <br /> I should specify, before I get my comments, that I saw it alone. I started to observe it before I went to bed and I started for about 15 minutes before I realized it was too effective, so I kept the rest in the morning. Even while I saw him in broad daylight, it was still creepy. However, I can not guarantee how effective it would be when observed in a larger group. <br /> <br /> After the death of his daughter, a couple moves to a remote cabin as a means to try to get to terms with this death. Let me take note of this death: this is one of the rare movies that does not get scared when a child dies. This is much more important, since it sets the tone and explains much of the performance that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> The couple is not doing well. The wife has distanced herself from the relationship, and the husband is doing what he can to try to recover it. While some of the comments have complained about their performance, one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than a husband and wife, and that is legitimate. He is trying to give you more direction. It is a role that men sometimes assume. <br /> <br /> There is a variety of scares in the movie, and most are quite non-violent, though somehow grotesque. The story itself feels very simple for most of the film and gives a strange twist near the end. While the turn is not absurd, it certainly is not what I expected from the way things had progressed. <br /> <br /> Moody, atmospheric and very well done for something that seems to have been filmed on video.
