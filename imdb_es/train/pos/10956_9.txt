For those who think that it is strictly humor and immaturity, in fact you are the one who has no mind. While the program contains its share of jokes, it also contains a lot of satirical material and mocks social problems, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. You just need to read a little more of your material to get it. <br /> <br /> What I also love is that everything is not an auction. For those who expect a joke formulated as Friends (I LOVE friends fyi), they will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humor, which is more realistic. We do not walk through this world and we have witty jokes for everything that is said, which is in most comedies. In contrast, the Sarah Silverman Program makes it more realistic in this regard. <br /> <br /> So do not take it as a senseless humor because it is so much more than that.
