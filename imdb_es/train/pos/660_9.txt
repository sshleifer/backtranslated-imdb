9 / 10- 30 minutes of pure holiday terror. It's okay, so it's not that scary. But it sure is fun. <br /> <br /> The Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) tells a story of FEAR on vacation, which gives us all Christmas Goose ... GosseBUMPS That's it. Bwahahahahha You must be very careful with what you call AX Santa. Have a frightful Christmas and a happy new fear. It's fine, I'll stop. <br /> <br /> Well, in the story, a greedy woman (the world's best crying woman, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the coach who is beaten to death with a towel) in ANOES 2) for the money. BUT, his plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a Santa suit (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) shows up. <br /> <br /> If you search on YouTube, you can watch it for free. , but most of you have already seen this (my third visit). But if you have not seen it, I suggest you do it.
