['This image for me has a great score, since it is a hugely funny and funny parody of Alien Invaders that take over a city and many of its men. <br /><br /> The city and the players are all embellished in a kind of 1950s style and the whole movie has a deliberate taste of bad taste and kitsch. Some of the scenes are fun, as with the birth of an alien creature. <br /><br /> All the actors offer serious performances and great blood, which makes the film even more fun and the special effects, and the Aliens are, at least, it seems to me that, intentionally, they are third category to add to the fun. <br /><br /> These types of films often deserve a following cult: <br /><br /> 8/10.']
