As part of our vocabulary of the late 1950s, we knew Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. well. in the great program "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> Saturday night arrived and everyone was glued to the television. This was a real show that represents family values. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that brought everyone together. <br /> <br /> Lorne Greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family. His words represent wisdom. We are often left with the doubt that Ben Cartwright, a widower, must have been the best of the husbands for that poor wife who had died. He raised wonderful children. <br /> <br /> Naturally, we all wonder why Pernell Roberts left the program. The show was a gold mine and Roberts delivered a lot of money when he left. His career never took off, as he was associated as a son of Cartwright. I should have tried to go back to the series. He certainly lost a bonanza by leaving.
