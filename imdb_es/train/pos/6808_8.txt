The 1967 In Cold Blood was perhaps more like "the real thing" (Think about it: do we really want to see the real thing?), But it was black and white in a world of color, and many people did not. I would even know what it was, and there was an opportunity to remake it for television. Also, if you redo it, you can show some things that are not shown in the original. The book In Cold Blood by Truman Capote was the first "non-fiction novel". Truman's book was not really 100% true to the real story. I thought the Canadian location was enough for Kansas for a television movie. Look for the elements of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll: Dick's wife, Perry as an aspirin addict, Perry playing the blues guitar.
