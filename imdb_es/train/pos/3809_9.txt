['Have you heard the story of reluctant heroes who were hired by a King to kill a dragon? Oh you have. Was it set in a world made up of small islands that floated above the clouds, and the heroes had to make dangerous jumps from one island to another on their journey? Did the water flow up and the remains of big cities levitate on the horizon? I did not think. <br /><br /> I came across this movie by accident and I&#39;m glad I did it. It&#39;s one of the most beautiful movies I&#39;ve seen in my life. Like Pixar movies, it is a computer-animated work of art that could only be possible in today&#39;s world. The animators have invested in almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is amazing (the scene in which the mushrooms in the foreground emit green smoke while the characters walk unconsciously in the background is one of my favorites). The monsters are also fully realized and are wonderful to see in action. <br /><br /> Although the plot may not be entirely unique, the film has enough charm to make sure you keep watching. Our protagonists are nice and interesting, ensuring that the audience is behind their almost impossible search to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon that could otherwise devour everything in its path. Of course, Hector is the character that will fall in love the most. A small blue creature with a crazy smile and a tendency to talk about a mixture of nonsense and English, Hector provides comedy relief in a way that Jar Jar Binks could only dream of. <br /><br /> In summary, I would recommend seeing The Dragon Hunters if you have the opportunity. Watch it to see the incredible animation, the impressive battle scenes and to glimpse a world that does not look like anything you&#39;ve seen on a movie or television screen. At least, it&#39;s a fun way to spend an hour and a half, it does not matter if you&#39;re nine or twenty-nine (which, in fact, I am)!']
