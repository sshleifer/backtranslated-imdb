['&#39;Renaissance (2006)&#39; was created over a period of six years, co-financed by France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom at a cost of around € 14 million. The final result is an amazing achievement of comic book style animation, aesthetically similar to what Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller achieved with &#39;Sin City (2005)&#39;, but this film used motion capture with live actors to translate their faces and movements in a fully animated format. Presented in black and white, the film seems to have been dragged from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based, and the futuristic city of Paris stands above us. Directed by the French filmmaker Christian Volckman, in his feature film debut, &#39;Renaissance&#39; is significantly based on other films of the science fiction genre, and the tech-noir story is not something we have not seen before, but, from a point of technical view, it is impeccable. <br /><br /> The year is 2054. The city of Paris is a crumbling metropolis full of dark alleys and deserted paths, the recent installation of modern technology simply offers a thin mask for the regrettable degradation of dark buildings. Avalon, the largest corporation in the city, achieved wealth by offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth, and the company&#39;s research department continually strives to invent better means to eliminate the aging process. Ilona Tasuiev (expressed by Romola Garai in the English version, which I saw), a brilliant young scientist, is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work, so it falls on the legendary detective Barthélémy Karas (Daniel Craig) to discover his current whereabouts . Possibly in possession of the key to the woman&#39;s disappearance is Bislane (Catherine McCormack), the hardened older sister of Ilona, whose reliability is questionable, and Jonas Muller (Ian Holm), the dedicated physician who worshiped Ilona as her own daughter . <br /><br /> The mysterious and dimly lit city of Paris is reminiscent of Ridley Scott&#39;s &#39;Blade Runner (1982)&#39;, and it seems that part of the technology could have been taken from Tom Cruise in &#39;Minority Report (2002)&#39; (which was, coincidentally , also set in the year 2054}. However, despite this familiarity, Volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit. Combining classic black cinema and science fiction, the result is a striking collage of hard lights and dark shadows, which, I must warn, sometimes becomes difficult in the eyes of the viewer. The dialogue is a little banal at times, and the story, although attractive, offers nothing surprisingly original (except the ending, which I thought was a bold turn in the usual formula), but the &quot;Renaissance&quot; is meant to work. better as a visual treatment, and that is successful in this regard can not be denied.']
