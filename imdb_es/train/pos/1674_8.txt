Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the adulterous wife of a great businessman who inherits a million million life insurance when her husband dies in a plane crash during a business trip. Initially, it is suspected that she is responsible, since her husbands will have done it recently. She has changed and that is why she has an insurance investigator Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent in the queue, just to be sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece to collect his inheritance, but insists on having it in cash ... a dangerous turn of events. Lynch, whose identity is now known by Baumer, tries to protect her against the mistress of her husband, Lara Florakis, who, however, along with his henchman, Sharif tries to kill them both for part of the money that she considers to be entitled. And this is where our masked assassin begins his brutal murders. Lynch, as is customary with our hero, is initially suspected by the Greek police and is warned not to leave Athens by the police inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli, a familiar face in Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch receives help from local journalist Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg), who helps him investigate the murders. Saying more could ruin the movie for anyone who has not seen it, so suffice it to say that there are enough clues and more. of them plausible to keep the fans of Mystery / Thriller happy in this story guided by Giallo. The No Shame DVD has an excellent soundtrack transfer in English and Italian. It also has a very catchy score just by Bruno Nicolai good measure that will stay in your head for a while ... in general, a first class Giallo.
