Oddly enough, all the previous comments simply described the beginning and left out the details. I feel the need to confirm that it is a family job, since Marina Vlady was also the wife of Robert Hossein, and the "excellent" jazz music was written by the director's father, Andr√©. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that it was a really good thriller, seen when it aired and immediately identified with the music. The suspense was impeccable, and it remained until the end. Robert Hossein, at that time one of the best European players, managed to impose himself as a director of screen and stage. It still presents great theatrical spectacles, with preference for religious themes .harry carasso, Paris, France
