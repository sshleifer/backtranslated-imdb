['NOTHING (3+ outta 5 stars) Another strange premise of the director of the movie &quot;Cube&quot;. This time, there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void. There is literally NOTHING outside of your small two-story house. Intriguing to be sure, but I thought that the comedic tone set for this movie from the beginning was extremely ill-conceived. There must be some humor, certainly ... and I have no problem with the humor that eventually stemmed from the plight of our two heroes (their final &quot;showdown&quot; was definitely a great success) ... but I really believe that the movie It would have been much better if it had stayed more rooted in reality at the beginning. After watching the movie, I saw the &quot;Making of&quot; feature on the DVD and a small trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the &quot;dumbest&quot; comedic features ... making it look like a completely different movie (and slightly better) ). The last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together ... similar to the recent movie &quot;Primer&quot;. The actors are fine when they are not exaggerating the comedy. They are really quite believable in their most &quot;normal&quot; moments. I was probably ready to write this movie as a failed experiment in the middle point ... but it convinced me in the end. (And keep looking beyond the credits for the final scene ... just do not ask me to explain it to you).']
