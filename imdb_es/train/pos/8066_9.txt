One of the best films of John Ford, 'The Informer', does not present any magnificent scenario of the American West. In contrast, the intense drama of Ford was known for the games in the no less hilly terrain of the face of the British actor Victor McLaglen. The former boxer, who once faced Joe Louis in the ring, presents an Academy Award-winning image of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple: in 1922 Dublin, a hungry and humiliated man who has been expelled from the IRA for not being able to kill an informant in cold blood, he himself becomes an informant. For 20 pounds, he betrays a friend to "the tans" and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in spasms of guilt, denial, self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his behavior. <br /> <br /> It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo that is the most impressive achievement of the film. In most of the films, a corpulent type of Gypo type would be considered heavy, would have at best two or three lines and would be eliminated quickly so that the hero and the villain could have their confrontation. In 'The Informer', Gypo himself is a hero and villain, while the confrontation is in his internal confusion, each part of which is explicitly shared with the public. <br /> <br /> Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel had been previously filmed in 1929, RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates, particularly the director of photography Joseph H. August, took advantage of this advantage to create a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar, 'The Informer' also won John Ford his first prize along with Best Screenplay and Best Score.
