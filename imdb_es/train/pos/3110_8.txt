['The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy (duh) is missing a bit in the history department, but it covers it with extensive action scenes! Twi, in particular, takes a lot of execution time and makes this movie better. <br /><br /> The director and the star (Damon) agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second film was quite ... advanced as far as history was concerned. How did they manage for that? The action scenes, for once, but they also did something else, which I can not reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, you will notice it! Interestingly, I read that this adaptation of Bourne&#39;s books is the least accurate of the three films ... if that means something to you: o)']
