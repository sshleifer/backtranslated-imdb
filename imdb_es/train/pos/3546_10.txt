['One of the best musicals ever made, this is an example of where the producers and the director were not afraid to choose actors because of their talent, rather than what people might expect. The lighting and the stage are unique, which gives it a very interesting effect (it has a special name that I can not imagine). The dialogue is also unique in that contractions are not used. The film is of good rhythm, beautifully acted and interesting from beginning to end. A real joy is music. A selection of top-level songs, from start to finish, that run and orchestrate perfectly. In addition, the music is very original and memorable, and I think it is superior to many musicals from the thirties to the sixties. Undoubtedly, it has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which could have only two or three. Not bad for a director without experience in this type of movies. Another quality is that it is fresh every time you see it.']
