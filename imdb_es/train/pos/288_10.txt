This movie was so great! I am a teenager, and my friends and I all love the series, so it shows that these films attract the attention of all ages. I recommend it to everybody. My favorite phrase in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says: "pink cheeks" when he is talking about his daughter. He is a great actor, as well as Erin Cottrell. They pair so well, and they have great chemistry! I really hope you can work together again. They are such attractive people, and they are very good actors. I have finally found movies that are good to watch. Lately I have found it difficult to find films that are good and that show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time, these movies are not corny.
