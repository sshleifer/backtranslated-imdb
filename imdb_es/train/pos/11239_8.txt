Hidden Frontier is notable for being the Internet-based series of Star Trek fans that has been the longest. While the quality of production is not on par with productions of fans like Starship Exeter, or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier is mainly focused on history, and in that sense it does very well. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier has no physique. sets instead, the actors are recorded against a green screen and the backgrounds are inserted digitally. One of the greatest achievements of Hidden Frontier is the large volume of work they have produced. One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting virtual sets at the time of filming, rather than in post-production. While this saves a lot of time, it is also worth noting that the quality of the resulting images is not as high as if it had been produced in postproduction, although it still fulfills its function. <br /> <br /> While it may not be a cup of tea for everyone, Hidden Frontier is worth a try, although you'd better start watching the third season, since this is where the producers really start to hit his step.
