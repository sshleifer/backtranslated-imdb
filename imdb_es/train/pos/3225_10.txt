When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew it was not going to be a mindbender movie. Instead, I thought it was a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating. And you know what worked. Kurt Russel did what I thought was a remarkable role in showing the soldier without emotions that he was. I recommend this movie if you go out with the guys and want to see a good action movie.
