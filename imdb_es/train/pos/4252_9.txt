This movie takes you inside yourself in the first few minutes and keeps you until the end. It has a very human story and very good music selected. The performance of Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfactory. Recommended for people who are bored of action movies and want to see a good movie.
