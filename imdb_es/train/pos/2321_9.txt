Here is the kind of love story that I enjoy seeing. And above all, it is for two reasons. One, concentrates young, VERY young. People who are still teenagers and experience love for the first time, or at least think that they are. We have all been there in our lives and "The man on the moon" is a magnificent reflection of our memories, perhaps adding some more details and improving them more than any of us has experienced. The second reason is that it is a love triangle. And I think that in adolescence, it's the most dramatic thing. And the story is so well developed that you think the characters might be really in love, or they're just so new to love that they just firmly believe they are and after a tragedy or something, they'll believe it for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> The cast of "The Man on the Moon" is full of great talented names. It is starring Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well able to play tough district lawyers, as well as strict, but careful and wise parents, as in this film. There's also Tess Harper, Jason London and a young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young and talented actress when she is fourteen years old and you think that in the next ten years she will win the Academy Award. All the cast members achieve great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling script, they are improved to look like real people in real situations. As if everything had happened. This is the kind of movie that I would like to see more often. Love story or not. I would love to see films that make everything look real and that is not false or amazing in any way.
