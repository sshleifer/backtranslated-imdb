Hahaha !!! Delirious was so funny ... I was crying. Eddie Murphys impressions are quite successful. The best impression was that of James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY !! It is strange to see how Eddie Murphy was at that time and how he is now DELIRIOUS, you have to see it, but if you do not like obscene language, do not look BUT INCREDIBLE AND FUN. I've seen it 6/7 times and I'm still peeing every time ... This is Eddie Murphy at his best and you can see where he got the humor and ideas from movies like the Crazy Professor. He also makes impressions of his family, which is really fun. <br /> <br /> if he was only there ...
