I affirm that no matter how much I look, I will never find a better film version of "Othello". If you love the magnificent masterpieces of Kenneth Branagh "Much Ado About Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) as much as I do, I'm sure you'll also find Oliver Parker's "Othello" irresistible. Laurence Fishburne has had several splendid roles during his career. It was very good in "Boys n the hood" (1991). I have always considered his fun role of Furious Styles as his greatest achievement. That was, of course, long before I saw this. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello and is probably in the most challenging role of his career, but he does a brilliant and fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is simply phenomenal in the most fascinating role of the twisted and manipulated Iago villain. The wonderful "Othello" is part of the absolute elite among the ingenious works of Shakespeare. He deals with his favorite subjects: twisting, envy, deceit and jealousy. This film adaptation is undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen, based on the works of William Shakespeare.
