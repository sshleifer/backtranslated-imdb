My Take: A ridiculous mess, but at the same time imaginative. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (Yeah! That Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter come back as the two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the BILL AND TED adventure comedy, THE EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, a classic worship. In this sequel, Bill and Ted have much more to do than travel through time. They could also travel heaven and hell too! During the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for a "Battle of the Bands" competition that can make them more famous than ever. Meanwhile, for many years in a futuristic civilization, the time magician of the first film (the ever-visible George Carlin) runs a university praising the names of Bill and Ted. There, an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from THE HUNT FOR RED October) plans to get rid of the two idiotic rock stars once and for all. So he sends two identical Android replicas (In the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us's) to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> Then, Bill and Ted experience death and must find their way through Hell, with denizens that include the worst memories of the duo, and then through the sky in an attempt to return to Earth to save his girlfriends ... and his show. Throughout this trip, they play board games with Death (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), which recalls a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic THE SEVENTH SEAL, help from a couple of intelligent alien beings . and more. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY's range of exuberant special effects is not up to current standards, and even some of the humor and appearance of the moment are somewhat outdated (for Be honest, the movie also seems to have been released in the wrong year, even in the 90s). But with no little lack of imagination and a turn animated by both the performances and the direction, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, imaginative and yes, false. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
