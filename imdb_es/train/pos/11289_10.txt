There is something wonderful about the fact that a film made in 1934 may be way above all the Tarzan films that followed it, including the bloated and boring Greystoke piece of the eighties. Once the viewer overcomes the first three scenes, which are certainly boring, Tarzan and his partner take off as if they were shots, offering non-stop action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is lovely and beautiful like Jane and leaves with the movie. Weismuller is solid too. Highly recommended
