Where would you start a review of the movie Snitch'd? James Cahill, the god who rests his soul, made one of the most daring visions of the human mind from the Encino Man. his beautiful story unravels around a McClure anti-drug squad, which is a name synonymous with a character of the simpsons who is also an actor. said police goes deep into the underground world that is drug use in high school, and discovers a gang war to rival that of Police Academy 1, and I mean that in which Jones is racially vilified for his new mate, but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will NEVER EAR. <br /> <br /> The understanding of Cahill's effects, both visual and auditory is electrifying, the slight pause between the action on the screen and the speakers adds to the drama that is breathed, a real Gritty as an underground thriller . Also, congratulations for their brilliant use of makeup, like the extremely convincing burn marks that a gang member suffers in their confrontation with a covered barbecue. Gross! I feel that the world of cinema is much less of James's death, his memory will persist again and again, he will be reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production, Snitch'd. the commentary of his insightful director threw a cocaine hit in the nose of any discerning movie buff, truly appropriate to the harsh reality that life on the streets is, captured in all the beauty of a swept punk that toppled a trash can in a fight. <br /> <br /> But I ask you, why does the pool of the big bosses look so cheap? I'll tell you why, because that's how life is in Santa Ana's baby, not all are pipes and offices built hastily, oh no. There are some people who must infiltrate the smoothest and most tattooed part of life on the street in Los Angeles to make their way in movements that do not seem out of place in the production of Double Dragon: The Play by School For Special Children. <br /> <The only complaint I have with this movie is that a sequel was never made. Come on, Steven Spielberg, come on, George Lucas, come on, boy who took revenge on the nerds from 1 to 23, how hard can it be to level up and pay homage to this great man, James Cahill? <br /> <br /> discovered Eva Longoria you know. oh yes, he did. <br /> <br /> Jonah
