It's easy to make really general comments about a movie like this. The fact that it is one of the only remaining Japanese films of this era makes people say that "Japanese cinema began" and was "different from everything the West has done". The last of these two comments is particularly false, since Kinugasa himself admitted cheating "Caligari" on more than one occasion. But the style was meant to be imitated, and does not detract from this movie. What we have here are experimental themes and compositions based on established visual styles, which open the doors for a brilliant superposition of narrations and realities. For this purpose, the asylum is the ideal scenario, and the writers knew it. This is a historical film and everything possible must be done to track it. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5: essential
