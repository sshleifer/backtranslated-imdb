Vivacious and irrepressible, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unexpected happiness to the lives of a lonely sister and brother on Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> Lucy Maud Montgomery's much-loved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie. Excellent production values, a literary script and first class performances give the story exactly the quality touch it deserves. <br /> <br /> Taking her professional name from the character she played, the actress Anne Shirley is a joy like the red one. A fourteen-year-old orphan who completely disrupts the lives of her new guardians. Completely sure of her starring role, Miss Shirley is a delight, entertaining the viewer with Anne's unlimited imagination, her quick temper and her not-so-secret sorrows. <br /> <br /> Playing the severe spinster who gives the girl a home, Helen Westley also completely directs her role; the spectator will enjoy seeing this sharp-tongued woman who slowly deviates from Anne's affection and infant innocence. The Australian actor of characters OP Heggie offers one of his best performances as the shy and gentle brother of Westley, who receives Anne in his heart from the moment he arrives to look for her at the railway station. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown is the one who most pleasantly plays the schoolboy who quickly attracts Anne's attention. Sara Haden is appropriately thorny like a nosy neighbor. Charley Grapewin makes the most of his few moments as an Avonlea doctor.
