['This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel I know. The representation of the Chancery court as a &quot;character&quot; in the drama is magnificent. The performance is wonderful, from the sinister Tulkinghorn, to the Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and the two young lovers. But it is the spider&#39;s web of the chancellery that holds everything together, and the cinematography is excellent. What mistake did the BBC make on the copyright that made this version unreadable in the UK on video or DVD for many years? I tried to find out about them, but I faced a stone wall. In the end I got a DVD copy of Canada.']
