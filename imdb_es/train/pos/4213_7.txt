The director Samuel Fuller invents a brilliant visual configuration: the conceited pickpocket unintentionally takes something from the microfilm of a woman's bag; It turns out that she is a messenger for the communists, and now she and the thief are being watched by the police. The Film Noir Formula is all its splendor, before the ingredients became clich√©s, including places in front of the sea, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack and a fistfight. The performances of Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are accurate, and the intelligent and defined script is quite colorful. The fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for her eighth-round support role as a "professional player." Exciting, atmospheric, hard as nails. *** since ****
