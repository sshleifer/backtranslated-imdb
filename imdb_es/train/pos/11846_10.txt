I really liked this movie. The entertainment was well done and the romance was nice. I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and Hans Zimmer's score was excellent. What many people do not realize is how well it relates to the themes of the Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse Now (what happens when the so-called "civilization" invades the home of another person, what it means to be "civilized", etc. .). The opening stage and the music were very moving. The movie is a lament for an America that was once beautiful.
