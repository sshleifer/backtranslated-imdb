<br /> <br /> I saw The Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine years old. I urged my parents to take me back three times. I started looking for it in a video about five years ago, I finally discovered a copy on an online auction site, but I would love to see a new distributor pick it up and republish it (I understand that the original video was small), or have the rights acquired by The Family Channel, Disney, etc. and it shows regularly. It is a fascinating film that introduces you to the story of the struggle for the life of a fox family in northern Japan, narrated by an old wise tree. The excellent soundtrack complements the film well. It would be a good seller today, better than many of the weak offers to children's movies today.
