['Farrah Fawcett has spent most of her post-Angel career confusing us, with an occasional noteworthy performance interspersed between her Playboy antics and Letterman&#39;s escapades. But when it comes to that, there&#39;s no denying that this girl can act. Far from a story of epic proportions, this well-made television movie is soft, silent and occasionally moving. Fawcett plays the misguided black sheep daughter who comes home only to discover that she missed the last days of her mother&#39;s life and the funeral, to the chagrin of her more stable and probably more sensitive sister. Brad Johnson interprets the love interest, and develops a story with all the typical elements of the telefilm drama, but there is always that disconcerting Farrah to see, and she, in fact, remains eminently observable. (And, yes, I admit it, when I had that Farrah sign on my wall). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on the cork meter. Bosley would be proud.']
