['First of all, Riget is wonderful. Good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. Nice combination of the strange &#39;dogma&#39; style of telling the story along with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no &#39;the end&#39;. As for me it is unacceptable. I was thinking ... how will it be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have an idea I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I&#39;m sure the third part without Helmer would not be the same. So here is my suggestion. It may be a bit stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not do small experiments with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create a puppet-directed animation (such as Trey Parker&#39;s &quot;US team&quot;) or even a 3D computer animation. I know it&#39;s not the same as the real actors, but in principle I think it could work ... only in this way is it possible to make the actors come back alive. For Riget fans, this should not be a big difference: if the animation is done properly, the average &quot;observer&quot; will consider it normal just after the first shots of the movie. The most important thing now is the story. It is completely understandable that it is not possible to create Riget 3 with actors today. So, why not play with the animation? And ... look for the possibilities it gives you! Even marketing one! The great director ends his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation. Only dreams? <br /><br /> I hope to see Riget 3 someday ... or even just watch the script. I&#39;m curious about how the story ends ... and as I hope, everyone here does. <br /><br /> say hello, slaj <br /><br /> PS: I&#39;m not talking about the &quot;hospital of the kingdom&quot; by Stephen King ;-)']
