['Fifteen years later and Paris Is Burning is still on fire. This is a classic in black gay movies, along with the other honorary films of black homosexuals, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This seminal work captures the underground and subclass black and Latino gay community and culture (ie, &quot;underserved&quot; like no other previous or later work, including all retrospectives and gay representations of sentimental Harlem Rennaissance.) They are good, but this is the best thing I say that the only &quot;real&quot; movie you&#39;ll find on the subject is Relentlessy Cunty (the invention of classical house music) comes to Hollywood, non-stop, the hilarious field (as only we do) and social criticism. this for a white director (who obviously must have been a Sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in a previous life.) I could go on, but I think you understand the point: I love this movie!']
