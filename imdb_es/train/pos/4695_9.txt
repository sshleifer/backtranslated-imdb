['What happened to Michael Keaton? What a great actor and it shows in this movie. This movie is really FUN! And the reason why this movie is fun is for two reasons: an excellent script and Michael Keaton. This movie is one of the funniest comedies in Hollywood history. This movie is the last parody of gangster movies. In this film, Hollywood actually makes fun of itself using the genre of the gangster movie as the basis for a truly original comedy. The rest of the cast is also fun, especially the cast. If you like to laugh and want to see a movie that contains continuous humor, then this movie is for you.']
