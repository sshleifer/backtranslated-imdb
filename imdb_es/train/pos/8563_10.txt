['The film follows the events of the novel &quot;Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni&quot; (which could be translated as &quot;The most beloved among humans&quot;), written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that became something like The Bible. or the story of Hamlet, very popular and difficult to obtain, due to its satirical content about the communist regime. It represents the drama of the intellectual man, the humanist, in a &quot;red&quot; world. A film full of passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great cinematographic recipe. One of the best Romanian films, despite its psychological burden (after all, it&#39;s a European movie).']
