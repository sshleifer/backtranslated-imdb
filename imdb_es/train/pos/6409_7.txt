['I had not heard of Brashear before seeing this. This is the story of him and the man who trained him, helping him become the first African-American diver in the US Navy. A tale of willpower. The plot is well written, and it develops very well in everything. This is what it seems, typical of non-favorites, and does not contain too many surprises. She&#39;s also pretty Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the real man, maybe he&#39;s close to how it really happened. However, he does the work, with dramatic scenes and adversities along the way, and this is inspiring for anyone who has heard the words &quot;no, you can not&quot; talk about his lifelong dream. The acting performances are all excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. shine when they are on the screen. Rapaport is wonderful, too. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. This is well edited, and presents a good photograph. The production values are high, and this does a pretty convincing job of transporting us back to the 50s. This is the only movie I&#39;ve seen by this director and the writer, although now I can consider studying more than they are responsible for. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise there is no offensive material. I recommend this to anyone who finds the topic interesting and / or fanatics of those who did it. 7/10']
