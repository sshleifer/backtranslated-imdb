This film resembles in many respects "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, since we have an innocent (black) man persecuted by the "government" with all the modern technology known to man. Usually, when the story is copied in this way, the result is a disaster. That does not apply here. Of course I love everything David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were more good things about this movie than that. The main character, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant, and the story flowed with excellent extras like David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was nonetheless irritating most of the role. It is so out of place, making bad jokes, without evoking the public's compassion. Or to begin with, the strange thing is that he grows a little in you (and also in his followers!). I did not expect much when I rented it, but I was surprised by a good solid action movie with comedy fragments. 7/10
