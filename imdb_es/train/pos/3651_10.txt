Pandora's watch is among the best thrillers you've ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you'll ever see. A very faithful adaptation of the novel by John J. Nance, which had a terribly real scenario in the novel, is made even more here. <br /> <br /> Despite being made for TV, this is a first class entertainment. The cast is great and it slides into the characters in the novel so well that one would think they were reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson moves away from the shadow of Macgyver and offers the best performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is excellent for her role as assistant ambassador in a role that proves she can be a good dramatic actress. Daphne Zuniga is excellent as Dr. Sanders and, even though the character is a man in the book, it works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and the rest of the cast of support are first class and conform to their novel counterparts to the letter. <br /> <br /> There are changes in the story, of course (included and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are better when compared to the novel. The plot is realistic and it looks great to believe in the way it is presented, which makes it the best airplane game since the original film of the airport. Production values ​​are high and, although special effects can look as good as they were a decade ago, they work well. The sets are great, especially the headquarters of the CIA and the Oval Office that show that the filmmakers spent a lot of time making this work. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if you see this first and read, then you read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you will not regret having lost four hours in this movie and how long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you breathless.
