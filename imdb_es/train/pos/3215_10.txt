['This was excellent. Touching, full of action and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 stars. This film is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns that there is more to life than soldiers, and that people who learn that there is a time to fight, a need to defend. I cried, I laughed and most of the time I was amazed by this story. Good writing work for an action movie, and the plot was appropriate and quite solid. The ending was not twisted, but it was still excellent. If you like to escape from New York or encourage the weakest, this movie is for you. It was not an excessive amount of blood or violence, it was not difficult to observe in that respect. Something for everyone']
