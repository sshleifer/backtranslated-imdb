A sober and reflective piece, a small miniature that blooms in a magnificent human pictorial sequence that goes beyond a mere dramatization for the screen. This small and quiet story will captivate you, if you do not have too many problems with the different Spanish accents, from the Mexican to the Peruvian, and the most authentic use of the Iberian Peninsula by Marisa Paredes! Garcíadiego has achieved a perfect adaptation of the novel: even the great maestro García Márquez should be proud of his excellent work. And congratulations to Arturo Ripstein, who has gathered with such skill all the effort in a gem, a ruby, and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so moving ... <br /> <br /> The Colonel - Fernando Luján : he is waiting to get his pension, while still living in his ramshackle wood that lives deep in the Colombian jungle (however, filmed elsewhere, NOT in Colombia) with his fighting cock and his wife (in that order? ). And that is all there is. <br /> <br /> But, oh, much more ... This movie is a rhapsody. <br /> <br /> I should see this little poetic piece again. as soon as possible. It's worth the high side of 8 out of 10, which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> This is not something light commercial Hollywood.
