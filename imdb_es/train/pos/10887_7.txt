A horror movie is being filmed and things are not going well. It is a masked assassin. The director tells the killer in front of the cast and crew. He goes crazy and kills two people. He committed suicide and the movie never ends. Twelve years later, a group of film students decide to try to finish it, but there is a curse. People who try and end it commit suicide. The students ignore that. Guess what will happen next? <br /> <br /> The plot is old but this is not bad ... for what it is (a low budget slasher movie). It's well done with a young and quite talented cast. No one is great, but nobody is terrible either. It also avoids the obligatory (and unnecessary) scenes of female nudes. It moves quickly, the gore is beautiful and bloody and the script does not insult your intelligence. Also Molly Ringwald is at this moment in her life playing a rude actress. <br /> <br /> There are no big tremors, but it's not bad at all. I give him a 7.
