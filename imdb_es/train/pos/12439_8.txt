While it is assumed that the main story will take place in Morocco, this film was shot in the fog of Romania in 18 days on a very tight budget. No matter how broken their cards are, the actors and the team play with remarkable skill and commitment, so that in the end I found the result moving and elegant. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy. The script and the direction provide some gems. Whether you like the movie or not, however, will probably depend on your version of Alexandra Staden in the lead role. Other critics have pointed out Staden's shortcomings as Modesty Blaise. They may have a point, but their interpretation seemed charming and very appropriate. Modesty manages to overcome terrible difficulties through discipline, innate talent and courage. Staden seems to be doing the same here.
