Ice Age is not just the year's animation (in my eyes), it's also the best animated movie I've seen! <br /> <br /> The teaser excited me last year and I spent many happy hours on the website. Scrat is great! And the same goes for the rest of the Sub Zero heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is excellent. Your heart really goes to the characters in this movie. They have good lines of dialogue and they are well developed. It is difficult to say which one really steals the photo. <br /> <br /> I experienced your trip with laughter, tears and amazement. Nothing was forced or done in excess. The emotion was genuine, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film that affected me so deeply was Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox production. And before that was The Land Before Time 1988. All possess a real charm and seek to entertain the entire audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
