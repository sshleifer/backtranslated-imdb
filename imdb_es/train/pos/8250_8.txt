This film takes place in the 1950s. According to this, the dead (called zombies) have emerged to eat the living. However, a company has developed a necklace that, when placed around the neck of zombies, makes them docile and perfect servers. The mother of the Robinsons, Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), father Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hire a zombie because everyone in his stable already has one. Tim names the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and befriends him. But his father hates him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things go wrong. <br /> <br /> As you can see, among many other things, a takeoff of the series "Lassie" with Fido as a substitute for Lassie. Timmy was named that for a reason! Each of the famous episodes of Lassie is spun here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido to get help before the zombies eat him! It's also a satire of those Douglas Sirk movies in the 1950s where everything is bright and colorful, but the dark secrets are tearing people apart. The characters wear VERY bright clothes from the 50s (Moss always wears a dress): the furniture, the environments and the cars, especially, are all from the 50s in very bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitive, there is always something to see. The script is good, but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can do. Melodramatics are a bit stupid, but the cast accomplishes it. Everyone here is excellent and successful. Even Connolly as a emotionless zombie does a good job. Moss is the best: play each line for its value, but never go overboard. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). Satire can be lost in most people and the blood is quite docile. The blood is made in a casual way and with happy music playing on it is difficult to take seriously. So, for some people, this will really work. I give it an 8.
