Fido is a story about more educated zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. However, everything collapses, when the young Timmy's zombie, Fido, eats the neighbor of the family. Thereafter, a disaster occurs (well, maybe not a disaster, but to some extent, chaos). Most people treat their zombies fairly, and one of those characters sleeps with his zombie (a very funny part of the movie, if not also very unsettling). And we find Fido the lover everything he can do. This is a very funny and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the less violent zombie movies (there is no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to people who are looking for something fun and different. I qualify this 8/10. Classification R for violence related to zombies
