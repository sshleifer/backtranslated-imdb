I am proud to say that I own an uncut copy of this select piece of the Crown International 70 sex comedy on DVD. It is a really ridiculous and pleasantly inconsequential film with a pleasant atmosphere of 70 years. Try to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a great wheel game and a quick tail. Sure, it's essentially a brazen male teenager fantasy photograph - the main silly teen character Bobby Hamilton gets the girls, the respect of his friends, and the opportunity to show a local stalker van racing - but it's too boring. kindly hate Stuart Getz, as our gawky protagonist, becomes a lovely dorky, Deborah White as the main object of Getz's affections is a definite beauty, Connie Lisa Marie is also quite delicious as a beautiful blond and mocking Neanderthal meat pie Stephan Oliver ( a 60's biker) perennial movie) is wonderfully obnoxious like the brutal Dugan Hicks. A Danny DeVito, prior to stardom, in particular, is an absolute disturbance like the bad mood of Getz's carwash boss, Andy, a lazy and misguided singer who wears ugly Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit. Especially I love the scene in which two thugs brutally beat Danny: one holds his arms behind his back while the other works on Danny's torso. And Sammy Johns' insidiously catchy theme song will bounce around your skull for at least a week. In short, the fun of retro-70 is great!
