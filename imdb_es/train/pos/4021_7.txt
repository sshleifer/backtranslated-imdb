A complex history placed at the bottom of the Bharat partition. An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl, and an educated Hindu who burns a Muslim's harvest, but in the end you end up liking them both. The story is powerful, but the script and the flow are hesitant. Musical background score and the songs are outstanding. Then comes the memorable performance of the veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography captures the time, violence and taste of rural Punjab very well. Other actors did not act well or did not have the opportunity to act. The direction is really the weakest link. The characters did not develop well. It is not sharp, in contrast to "the Earth", where even a 5-line character leaves a mark. The end is very interesting. This story could have several different endings, and all of them could have been just as good.
