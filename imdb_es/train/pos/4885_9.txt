The possible spoilers are: cameos of late appearance <br /> <br /> Rarely one sees so many actors of fine and memorable characters (almost all actresses, to be precise) in a movie. Although only a few appear for the cameos, each one is a gem. The British make this mix of comedies and real-life pathologies better than anyone else, so it's not surprising that most of the actors are British. <br /> <br /> The music is great; no doubt, a lot had to be bent (Leslie Caron * really * plays the bass so well? maybe, who knew?) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself, her warm visceral sound still moves me like other jazz singers . <br /> <br /> As an old musician, not so old and certainly not in that class, of course, it was also an encouraging film: a great movie for all those who wonder if they have excelled in their profession or vocation whatever it is. And, of course, a great celebration of stage life. <br /> <br /> I missed a bit of the opening, but a provisional 9/10, and it certainly makes us want to see everything.
