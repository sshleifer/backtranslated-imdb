The comparison with Sleuth, the previous theatrical game turned into a movie, is obvious and, in my first time seeing it, I also thought that Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap has, at least for me, many more reproductions than Sleuth. <Br /> <br /> I bought Deathrap in the bargain box at Wal-Mart, thinking I had Caine and the Reeve underestimated and that it was worth $ 6. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could have picked up. <br /> <br /> It's one of those best-kept secrets that movie fans are always happy to discover. And it's worth repeating the sightings. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine behaved bravely in Sleuth, I was doubly impressed that Christopher Reeve was Clifford Anderson. Reeve, legitimately associated with his now legendary performance of Superman, stole the show in what should have been an Oscar-worthy performance. I've always felt that Reeve was a supporting actor who did not have the chance to shine outside of the Superman movies and some other defective but entertaining films like Somewhere in Time, but this movie shows that his potential was truly beaten and put to use , Thank God. <br /> <br /> Absolutely enjoyed the performance of Michael Caine. He was skinny, deliciously manipulative and sadistic. And seeing him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact, it was thanks to this film that I entered a "Michael Caine phase" and began to rent as much as possible of their stuff. <br /> <br /> As for Deathtrap, there is enough juicy dialogue here to fill your "memorable quotes" section. (Unfortunately, much of the dialogue would intrinsically ruin the immensely entertaining plot). <br /> <br /> It is very, very difficult to talk about the film without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own. Needless to say, it is a must see. But for me, it was the biggest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time. <br /> <br /> Repeated visits are a must. <br /> <br /> And it deserves to sit next to Sleuth on his DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> I'll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the movie: "I wonder if I would not ... I know ... well ... just a little starry eyes from me to get into such a collaboration. risky and exciting ... where I can not count on any sense of moral obligation ... at all. "
