['This movie is very interesting. I&#39;ve seen it twice and it seems that Glover hit the nail in the head with what he says he wants to achieve. For my part, I can relate to the indignation that the filmmaker expresses clearly against the current unthinking corporate nonsense that is an attack on all our media centers, and the things that, as a culture, we are not supposed to &quot;think&quot; because to the control of corporate media. . The indignation that Glover expresses through the &quot;outrageous&quot; elements in the films is clear in his visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in his poetic power. I&#39;m glad to have seen this movie and it&#39;s even clearer that Glover is plotting something interesting with the second part of what will be a trilogy. It&#39;s okay! EVERYTHING IS FINE. Look at that too. People who dismiss this movie as &quot;unthinking&quot; or &quot;pretentious&quot; are really losing the pot. It is a smart movies. If you can see it with his live show that he does before with his books, that&#39;s also very irritable. The way you enter your mentality is really something. You will have an experience!']
