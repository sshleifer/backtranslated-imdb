I was having the worst day of my life. Then I came across this beautiful movie, I saw it and now I'm ready to go out and kiss a lamppost. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only saw her for two reasons: THE LEGS OF VERA-ELLEN. But it is really much more. The plot is actually quite intelligent and creative woven. It's almost like a Shakespeare comedy with all its charming misunderstandings. And, of course, there are also ... THE LEGS OF VERA-ELLEN. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is that the version I bought (Mill Creek Entertainment's "100 Family Classics" collection) does not have the best video quality, and I've heard the same thing about the release of Alpha. The brightness and contrast are too high, so many of the scenes seem discolored, especially when Vera dances with a white dress. But I suppose you can play with your TV controls to compensate. I can only imagine how it looked on the big screen in '51. The scenarios, the costumes and the colors are dazzling and deliciously spooky, more or less like a streak in the "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari". <br /> <br /> When it comes to romance, this is just perfect. Not sappy, not devised, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Pity, poor imbeciles, your miserable lives will never be as charming as this. Har Har Har. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life is as bad as yours. Oh hell It's time to see this movie again.
