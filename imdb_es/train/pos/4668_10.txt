This movie now appears on digital TV at least once a month, I've seen it a dozen or more times and it never fails to delight me. If it were on tomorrow I would see it again. Such is the art that can be created by Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians of the acting profession, helped by the magnificent supporting trio of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Do not forget others in minor roles. <br /> <br /> It is a simple story, just told, of an ex-convict, an evil villain, fighting and triumphing with the then "new age technology", that is, computers, and discovering affect in the process. Even if it's a bit implausible (tongue in cheek), even incredible, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and best of all, it is not a horrible method of acting that prevails today. A real lesson for modern filmmakers on how to make a great show from and with practically nothing ... except exceptional talent.
