['The first time I saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI premiered during the Hawaii International Film Festival. WOOHOO! The blood left us speechless with his absolute enthusiasm, gore, vitality, gore, emotion, gore, absolute campiness, and even more gore, and all in SO GREAT FUN! Especially for those of you who enjoy all those Japanese samurai and ninja chambara movies, YOU DEFINATELY HAVE TO SEE THE BLOOD!']
