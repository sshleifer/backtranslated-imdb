As a native of Bolton, this movie has an obvious appeal to me. The location shots are fascinating and show Bolton very much in the transition; there is a series of scenes of apparent negligence, but this serves to show the city that is being reconstructed, and the idea that the old must give way to the new is the most important. of this movie. James Mason, a little wasted, heads a pleasant set in a story about a herring scandal that transforms into a full-fledged generational conflict, and then into a pleasurable and abysmal resolution. Although I am a bit too young to remember it completely, the minutiae of Lancashire's life in the 60s are all here: charging a Friday, piano songs, constitutional Sunday, good neighborliness, courtship tremors, the massive importance of the self-esteem, and I was pleased to see that Naughton's funniest lines of work remained intact. There is no doubt that this film should be available on DVD, it is well prepared and most of the performances are well done.
