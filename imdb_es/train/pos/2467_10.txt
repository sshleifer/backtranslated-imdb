Why did not this pick up a bag full of Oscars? It is an amazing interpretation of a piece often filmed / performed. The images are impressive (especially in widescreen ... the pan & scan really kills the wonderful cinematography and sets of this movie). Each painting is a painting. Amazing. The work is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for it is clear from the initial titles. There is no Zefferelli here, just a great narration of the way only the movie can, but it rarely does. Jacobi is especially perfect as Hamlet's murderous uncle: he does not interpret him as an evil villain with a mustache, but a charming politician, who lets us see why only Hamlet suspects foul play. Branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between the false / real madness of Hamlet and the fiery vengeance within him. And the many cameos turn out pretty well, everyone, from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, discreet if they are absorbed by Branagh's vision as it was. A fascinating piece.
