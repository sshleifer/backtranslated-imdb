"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've seen. A tragicomedy with very profound implications on the destiny of humanity shown through the eyes of apparently very simple and common people of a Serbian province abandoned by God just before the start of World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia, where the film had had a very limited distribution, and since then I had no chance to find it. It's a pity that this excellent movie is almost forgotten now. I searched for a copy on VHS or DVD many times and, unfortunately, I could not find any. I would be very grateful to other fans of this little gem of making movies for a suggestion of ways to buy a copy.
