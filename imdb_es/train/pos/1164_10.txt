I saw this movie when it first came out. It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for the best photo. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is a psychotic, but complex Amanda. This is not your ordinary psycho movie. A lot of interesting and original inclinations about the genre. A kind of "Fatal Attraction" for the younger group with good blues music mixed with the object of Amanda's affection, is married to a promising blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off. <br /> <br />
