One of the greatest outstanding animation works. Although it makes the most sophisticated use of the "clipping" method of animation (to the "South Park"), the real talent behind "Twice Upon a Time" are the vocal characterizations, with the music of Lorenzo Music ( Carlton of the television "Rhoda") Woody Allen-ish Ralph, the animal of all purpose, is the centerpiece. The sequence of "accidental nightmare" is undoubtedly one of the best animated pieces ever filmed.
