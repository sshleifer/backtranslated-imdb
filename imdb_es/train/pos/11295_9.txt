This movie has always been one of my favorites since I first saw it as a 12-year-old boy in 1962, when it aired on the "last-minute show" of a Los Angeles television station. The characters are very attractive from the beginning of the image, and it is a pity that the film has never been released for a video tape, or shown on television (apparently due to a ban on the state of Moss Hart, the playwright). / the producer / director who wrote the story and presented it for the first time on the New York stage during World War II (the reason for denying its presentation is difficult to understand more than 50 years after it was made). I did not watch the film again for more than 30 years, when someone who had really been an important member of the cast of the film was able to get me a "pirated" copy on VHS (poor video quality, but good audio). My memory was correct: it was still an attractive and fascinating movie to watch. A surprising aspect of this film is the number of its stars, who just started their careers in 1944), became great movie stars or at least well-known and fully employed actors (for example, Judy Holliday). , Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the Liberators B-24 are incredible, especially the close-up shots where you can see the details of the giant (for those times) 4-engine bomber (of which more than 18,000 were manufactured, now almost extinct). A good view of the different levels of training that a pilot-cadet went through on his way to be assigned to a bomber team (of course, very gender-biased as was the trend of the day: only MEN became pilots, Women simply supported them in their roles, hardly acceptable in today's world, I hope that one day it will be published on video for a new generation to enjoy.
