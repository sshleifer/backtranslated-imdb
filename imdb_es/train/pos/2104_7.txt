Who does not know Largo Winch in the trio France-Belgium-Luxembourg (the three countries where the French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are massively published)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic, which is in itself an adaptation of a series of novels, had to be adapted on the screens. After a first attempt (and failed) with a television program, reality begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, and that's what most fans did not get, the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the series of comics. Some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a fan of class 1 of the comic, I must confess that I was pleasantly surprised. The actors are good, as is the stage, although it may seem too fast. Therefore, I recommend this film to all those interested in financial / political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to the James Bond or Jason Bourne series, since I was able to read them on the Internet.
