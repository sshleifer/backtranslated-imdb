Even in the 21st century, having children is dangerous: women have miscarriages and give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. That is the theme of "Life begins": a look at the "difficult cases" of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the main role, a woman brought here from prison (the crime she committed has nothing to do with the plot) to give birth; She is in conflict over the fact that she will have to leave her baby after birth. She is in a room with several other women, who share their joys and sorrows. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is the protagonist, the outstanding performance, as always, is set by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, appearing heavily in supporting roles and, sometimes, gaining the lead in the B movies (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several installments of the film series " Torchy "). Farrell plays a future mother who does not want her children, as they will only stand in the way. She does everything possible to prevent nurses, including the smuggling of alcoholic beverages in the room (this, of course, during the Prohibition days), and drinking like a fish, apparently, had never heard of the syndrome of alcoholism fetal. The 1930s. Interestingly, unlike most films of the early 1930s, they are not the clumsy idiots who get in the way of heroic men: that situation reverses , and the prospective parents are shaking gelatin mounds. (Watch for veteran character actor Frank McHugh as one of the future parents). "Life Begins", being a primitive talkie, treats the subject with a good amount of melodrama, without a doubt, but it is a charming little film. Turner Classic shows it, although infrequently; I've only seen him appear in a few days in honor of Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to see it when it appears.
