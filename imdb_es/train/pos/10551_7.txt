Sitting, writing? Nothing is the ultimate "what if?" festival offered by Vincenzio Natali, and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One of them is having relationship problems, having been canned from your job (due to relationship problems) and the police are trying to get you out (due to your work and your relationship problems). The other guy is an agoraphobic who refuses to leave his house, he finds an annoying guide who calls his mother to say she was annoyed when he does not buy her cookies. Oh, yes, the police are looking for it too, after the girl's mother called them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what a day. <br /> <br /> What would happen if I could make all this disappear? That's the whole premise behind 'Nothing'. The two fools realize, the police, the scout girl, the cars, the grass, the road, everything? disappear. There is nothing more than blank spaces! This is an interesting concept that I thought. I also watched at the time of this, had spent 30 minutes in the movie, and I still had an hour in the movie. Could the 2 actors do this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes? Although the actors try, 60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in the places of this film. But the two actors, who are lifelong friends and the director, have a great repertoire between them, which was fun to watch the dialogue and improve the nonsense between the two. There are many supernatural elements, but it is more of his response to these elements that makes it worthwhile to watch this movie.
