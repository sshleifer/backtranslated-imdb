I loved this movie when I was a kid. I cried every time I looked at him. It was not unusual for me. I totally identify with the characters. I would love to see him again (and I hope he does not disappoint me!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really attracted to the fantasy world. And for me the movie was very long. I wonder if I ever saw the series and confused them. The performance I thought was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. I was so dreamer with a 10 year old boy (when I saw the film for the first time, not in 1970. I still remember the characters vividly.The flute was totally believable and I can still "feel" the evil forest.) Witchy poo was scary .. I would not want to cross his path.
