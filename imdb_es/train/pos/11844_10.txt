I started riding horses quite recently, and, as everyone who has ridden should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life with all the material related to the horse I could, and I was surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> What I expected was a Disney movie to feel good about. with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> What I got was an incredible movie, full of beautiful landscapes and animations, and an incredible story that has the great potential to warm the heart. <br /> <br /> The spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose entire world collapses around him when he discovers that humans are slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide variety of characters, some humans, some animals, all are well written and most are nice to see on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story. and who appreciates history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but that I feel is important, is that the animals in this movie do not speak. These were a really nice vacation from the animated films Lady And The Tramp to which we are all accustomed today.
