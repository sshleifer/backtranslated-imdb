The first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen. It was a bad version of 'Back to the Future' with zero charm. Once accepted that Bill and Ted are idiots, the joke can only be criticized by the audience for so long before it breaks. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> By today's standards, this is more fun. This was avoided at the time of release, sad because there is more talent involved than the first time. We get the 'Face / Off' photographer, the editor of 'Fugitive', a production designer from Burton's early work, and the 'Matrix' sound designer. <br /> <br /> The writers did their superficial work. First exit with something deep. Since this was rejected by the fan base and the audience, the director probably decided that the style was too extreme. It is not, it fits the material. Just like 'Death becomes her' and 'Capture-22', this dares to be smart, but we like our "simple" movies, so we do not buy them. Probably, because he dared to be different, that's why it took 12 producers to achieve it. What is so good? <br /> <br /> - Good reference to himself towards Keanu; of air head to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> --Joss hates his creations as much as he hates his counterparts, he makes his own hatred. The Evil B & T and the "good uses of robots" have the same vocabulary as their originals: fewer copies and depreciation of the language. <br /> <br /> - The motive of "duality". Nowhere is this evident that in photography styles, many high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith's "Total Recall" to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - The "election" motive. I do not know where this started in the genre (maybe 'Ghostbusters'), but it's used pretty well here. It even comes down to the 7 games against death: Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - Self-reference of the film, even present in the game against Death (Track). This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. See the cover of Premier magazine at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." It is also ironic that Death and Nomolos were villains in the sequels of 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon'. <br /> <br /> I still have some minor nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and cinema are different media, so it does not make sense that many scripts revolve around the first, especially in the adolescent market. Carlin is a great comedian, but in these films he is wasted. Also, in spite of all the audacity that demonstrates this effort, even to make jokes about homosexuals, can not they kill a cat? <br /> <br /> So, despite looking like a Nickelodeon production, this is incredibly interesting. From this movie we have Beavis and Butt-Head. "We are in heaven and only assault three people." <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Medium range material
