This film has a very simple but intelligent premise: an unemployed man who tries to steal at a convenience store, and the store employee catches him on the spot ... the thief escapes with the store employee right behind him . Meanwhile, the store clerk is in trouble with a low-ranking Yakuza chinpira (gangster). Throughout the search for the thief, they attract the attention of the Yakuza who has been looking for the store clerk. The story then moves at full speed in the form of a Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but is added with the dog chasing the cat. The second full act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (can be translated into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is about the persecution, and the persecution continues to the point where at the end of the second act, the tramp forgets why he is running away and the Yakuza don. I do not remember which of the 2 guys he is chasing, nor remember why they are running away from him. <br /> <br /> As in the last SABU POSTMAN BLUES movie, most of the movie is simply chase. and action, with a lot of physical comedy and black humor injected to keep the audience engaged. What is short is the end, which stops the pursuit when the three men are left without energy, and are in one of the most chaotic Mexican clashes that will see in the film that it seems that Sabu was paying tribute to Tony Scott. TRUE ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).
