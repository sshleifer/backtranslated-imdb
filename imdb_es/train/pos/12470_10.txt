['I just watched this movie on television. <br /><br /> I lost my dad when I was young and this movie probably touched me ... <br /><br /> I can feel the loss that the girl Desi felt ... <br /><br /> The feeling of wanting to see his father again. <br /><br /> wanting to talk to him .. <br /><br /> or at least have the opportunity to say goodbye .. <br /><br /> and I&#39;m so excited about the letter that I wrote again ... <br /><br /> saying that his father read his letter and sent it to someone to answer him and buy him a gift because there is not a store in heaven. <br /><br /> it just lets me feel that miracles exist ...']
