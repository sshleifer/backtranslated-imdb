Finally, the uncut version of "Baby Face" comes up and from what source? The congress library. The four restored minutes, fragments here and there, make a much better movie. Now we know that Baby Face was harassed by her father since she was at least fourteen years old. Another reason why he behaved and his cold and calculating exterior. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is really amazing in the role of Lily Powers (notice the nickname), a part that required the right amount of sexuality. covered with power, cunning and revenge, but tinged with virginal pretext when asked, a portrait very difficult to make convincing. Barbara Stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that, although she sleeps until she reaches the top (literally), she still has good will in her heart. Observe the way she treats the few who have been as kind to her as Chico (the wonderful actress). Teresa Harris) and the old philosopher. And although it exploits its sexuality to make porridge of rich and powerful men, those same men try to exploit it for their carnal desires without the intention of having permanent links until they fall in love with it. <br /> <br /> Lily Powers does not understand, at first, that emotions are difficult to manage, that it is easy to lose control. A possible result is death. Hooking a wagon to a star, of course, materialism can take you to a destination where there is nothing but the ephemeral, and it is a cold and lonely place. <br /> <br /> A word must be said about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, whose Will to Power is emphasized in "Baby Face" by the elderly philosopher who befriends Lilly when he is still doing tricks for his father . "Baby Face" was released the same year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Although it is highly unlikely that Hitler, who was semi-literate, understood much about Nietzsche, he considered himself a Nietzschean until the ninth grade and promoted it along with his other speeches. "Baby Face" serves as an accusation of the popular interpretation of Nietzsche's will to enhance the concept, especially in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> Although "You have the prettiest face". is appropriate as a theme for "Baby Face", an even more revealing and applicable melody is WC Hand's "St. Louis Blues", which is played throughout the film, especially when the camera has to move away from what would be scenes sexually explicit. . "St. Louis Blues" is also used wisely towards the end when Lily begins to see beyond materialism and eternal values. Chico is singing a crude and salacious version of "St. Louis Blues" when Lily, now at odds with the lyrics, commands her to stop. <br /> <br /> The restored version of "Baby Face" makes the film more modern in its focus and attitude towards sex as power than many new Hollywood releases. By all means see this jewel from the distant past and enjoy.
