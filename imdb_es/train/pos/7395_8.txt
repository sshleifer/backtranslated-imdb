Almost the entire film takes place in a public bathroom in China. There are no sophisticated scenarios, explosions or glamorous people, just fine writing, acting and directing (Hollywood, take note!). <br /> <br /> A remote child returns home when he thinks his father is dying. He is surprised to see that dad looks good and is running the family business as usual. In fact, he realizes that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and supportive relationship, and soon it becomes obvious that he is out of place! Dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and he really does not see the value of the old bathhouse. The way your relationship changes and where the plot is going is exceptional and credible. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see that not all Chinese films are an action image (like those starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), since I'm not particularly interested in these frantic movies. The Shower and Springtime In A Small Town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films about PEOPLE.
