Lily Mars, a small city that lives in Indiana, dreams of succeeding on Broadway and her aspirations are enhanced when the successful Broadway producer, John Thornway, returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to make Thornway notice, but he only gets mad at her antics. When Thornway returns to New York to present his program, Lily follows him (unknown to John, of course) and Thornway finally gives him a small role in his next show, just as a favor for his family, however, Thornway begins to fall in love This young girl and a romance bloom, which makes the show's protagonist, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel gets tired of the romance between John and Lily that causes friction with the show, she leaves and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she has returned to her small role in the play, which can also jeopardize the romance. A very charming film and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comic touches in his role (his reading of Lady MacBeth, although it is supposed to be humorous, never threatened his career as a singer). I enjoyed more the character of Heflin (Thornway) when I was upset with him. Lily instead of being romantic. The film became somewhat predictable and the scenes were not put together so well together, but a very nice movie. Score, 7
