If you did not enjoy this movie, or your death, or if you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast, all of which gave good performances. This film proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler is becoming a very respected actor. It all started with his performance in Big Daddy, then he made a couple of bad films, then broke with an excellent performance in 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, then Click, and now Reign Over Me. <br /> <br /> Go back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The closest thing to the family he has is a mother-in-law and a father-in-law. After his old roommate in college (Cheadle) ran into him, it seems to change his life. I will not say more, because I do not want to ruin the movie, but I recommend this movie. One of the best movies of 2007.
