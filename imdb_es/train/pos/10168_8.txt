Look, it's Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend harassing the new girlfriend. It's Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and the guy who was wearing "sex panther colony" in Anchorman. If you are waiting for a Golden Globe nominated film, then you should reconsider how you view the films. However, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie, you have come to the right place. The characters are all fun. They work together very well. The real showdown is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He is as funny as he was in Friends and she was funny and good looking at the same time. I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and so did I.
