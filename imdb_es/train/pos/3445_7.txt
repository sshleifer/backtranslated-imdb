First, this was a BRAVE movie. I have seen Irreversible and I can understand the comparisons. However, I can not begin to understand the people who have destroyed this movie. I can see how the ending may have been extreme, but I would be lying if I did not say that I wished that all the men who ever forced a woman to have sex deserved exactly what Jared got. On the contrary, it did not solve anything, nor did anything improve, and the fact that the film does not intend to do so is what made me appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The previous commentary to this called the movie pathetic and claimed No adult would stay with it. Certainly I did it and attentively. I'm 24 years old. The way the film is dragged made me realistic. People have become so used to visual candy and fast-paced screen patterns that if they are asked to concentrate too much on a brick at the base of a film, they not only lose interest, but demolish what has been built. and they call him. trash. When in reality it is your lack of patience and understanding that needs a fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind like that of Talia Lugacy. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson perfectly showed the numbness of self-destruction. I think she portrayed Maya before and after the assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act that I rarely see well done. Many times, like the films "aimed at teenagers" mentioned in the previous commentary, the effects of rape are shown as extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and lifeless. Dawson, in my opinion, manages to carry out the balancing act, so many survivors are victims of: the existence of a drone in waking hours, working on a dead-end job to survive (and distract) and then excessively in vices to get lost in themselves. The haze of substance abuse instead of facing what sobriety brings. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie told the truth and I appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape. Many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning ... I think Maya's face during the act was the end ... not the act itself ... neither the revenge nor the meaning behind it ... only his face ... <br /> <br /> thank you
