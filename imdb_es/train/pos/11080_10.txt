First, when people listen to "GUY RITCHIE", they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that they all associate Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect him to explore new frontiers. This movie REVOLVER is different to snatch; It is much darker and it is very complex. The reason why I gave a rating of 10 is because I had to watch Revolver 3 times to understand everything. So this movie plays with your head. It is very well written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It was beautifully done, the photography is beautiful, and you can recognize the personal touch (style of directing) of Guy Ritchie. <br /> <br /> What convinced me was the complexity of the protagonist and how we stayed. More questions than answers.
