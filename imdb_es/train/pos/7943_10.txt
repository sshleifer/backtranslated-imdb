I love this TV series so much. It contains animation that is interesting and beautiful. I can not believe they interrupted him on television, and I never knew if cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was, by far, the BEST television show in history. I know it's too late to wait for the series to start again, so I'm very happy to have seen it. I loved it so much <3 <br /> <br /> it's about a woman by the name of cybersix, she is not human. She goes by hunter Adrian, a male teacher at a high school. Now cybersix is ​​really a woman, only disguises as a man in the day. At night, cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A guy called Von Reichter is the one who created cybersix, and once he finds that he's alive, he uses everything he can to capture it. <Br /> <br /> IF you've never seen it before, you should download it completely. It was the best television program in the world. Why did they cut it? Some people have problems But I'm glad to have seen all 13 episodes.
