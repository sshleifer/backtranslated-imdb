This is an absurd dark comedy from Belgium. Taken perfectly in black and white, Beno√Æt Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) is in very good shape as Roger, the angry and obsessive father of a family in a small Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, together with his little daughter Luise, visits traffic accidents to take pictures. He is also obsessed with winning a car by participating in a competition in which the competitor has to break a record, and decides that his son, Michel, should try to break the record of walking perpetually through a door. He even hires an overweight trainer to train him. Michel dresses like Elvis and has a place on a radio show called 'Cinema Lies', where he describes the mistakes in the movies. Luise is friendly with her close neighbor Felix, a more luxurious pigeon. Roger is an insensitive figure when he pushes Michel over the limit during the search attempt, which almost results in his death. Interspersed throughout the film are surreal Magritte style images. It is undeniably charming and well worth your time.
