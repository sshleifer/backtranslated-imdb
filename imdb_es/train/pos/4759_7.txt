An ingenious little episode played mainly for laughter, but with an ingenious dose of suspense. Somehow, a Martian has sneaked aboard a broken bus on his way to nowhere, but what passenger is it? (Talk about your illegal immigrants!). The support cast of all the stars, from Jack Elam with wide eyes (doing it without shame), to the sexy Jean Willes (if it's the Martian, then I say we open the borders!), To John Hoyt, with a cruel face ( the most obvious suspect), along with familiar faces, John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice twist of Bill Kendis as the bus driver). A very entertaining half hour ago, even if the action is limited to a single set.
