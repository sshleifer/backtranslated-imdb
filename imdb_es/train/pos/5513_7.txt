From what I read, many people were disappointed by this movie, compared to Part 1. Initially, I could understand this, but after thinking a bit, I think they are wrong. Soderbergh continues his account based on facts about Che's life that began in Part 1. Part 1 told the story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a finally successful conclusion. Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Che's life have had completely different results. He courageously chooses to tell both of them in a fairly direct way. The viewer can feel much better leaving the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2, but that is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion, it is the director's fault. The movie is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in Part 1, we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrilla succeeded. In Part 2 you can not take a break and we see that your number is constantly reduced by death and capture. The capture and death of Che are well treated. The film is reinforced by the dialogue in Spanish. Benicio del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentine. So, if you've seen Part 1, you'll see a very similar story from a very different story in Part 2.
