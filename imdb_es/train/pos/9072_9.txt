I remembered that it was one of my favorite books as a child and I had wanted to read it to my 5-year-old daughter for a long time. I knew the movie would be out soon, so we went to the library to find the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day! We ran home and spent the afternoon reading the book to compare. It was not necessary The only thing in common between the book and the film is the name of the main characters, the fact that there is a wager and a large number of worms that they eat. Oh, yes, I almost forgot, the child who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a French accent. How the children are known, the number of children involved, how the bet arose, the number of worms that should be eaten, the time period in which the worms have to eat, how they are cooked, the progression of friendships, Climax Scenes, etc., NOTHING is the same. But somehow, it did not ruin the movie for me. The characters are all nice, and the movie did not leave me disappointed. A warning to parents: there was a time when adults could be heard in the room collectively out of breath and it was when Billy's younger brother referred to his penis as a "dilly dick". The shameful part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those who were sitting around us: "Does anyone know what an idiot is?" hahaha That and an occasional "silence" is as foolish as it gets in this movie. My daughter thought she could get sick with worm 3 and 4 (and was holding the empty nacho container just in case) but it was fine with the worm 6. She and I enjoyed the movie a lot and had a wonderful time sharing the experience .
