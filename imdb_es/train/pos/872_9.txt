Carla works for a property developer where she stands out for being unattractive, despised and desperate. She is also deaf. <br /> <br /> Your boss offers to hire someone to relieve your heavy workload, so take the opportunity to secure a male company. Help comes in the form of Paul, a tattooed bully fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the routine of an office environment. <br /> <br /> An implicit sexual tension develops between them and Carla is determined to keep it despite her reluctance to embrace the work week. When Carla left an important contract that was negotiating with a slimy colleague, she exploits Paul's crime by having him steal the contract. The colleague quickly realizes that she is behind the theft, but when he confronts her, Paul's willingness to hit people in the face is also useful, but this fight has a price. <br /> <br /> Some mafia acquaintances give 'Paul' a reminder about unpaid debt. He formulates a plan that uses Carla's unique lip reading skills to defraud a gang of violent bank robbers. Now it's Carla's turn to enter a new and frightening world. <br /> <br /> Director Jacques Audiard's fourth feature, "READ MY LIPS" begins as a romantic drama between two marginalized losers just to change gears in half. An exciting thriller where their symbiotic defects make them winners. The cables are excellent; Convincing us effortlessly that this strange couple could really connect. Carla's first encounter with Paul is a pleasant farce in which she tries to circumnavigate her reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was, until very recently, a jailbird. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has that almost exclusive ability to go from silly to beautiful and return within a frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul like a cornered dog that only seems to be at home when he gets beat up or invents the scam that will probably kill him. <br /> <br /> Like many French films, 'READ MY LIPS' seems, at first, to refer to nothing in particular until you scratch below the surface and discover that it's probably about everything. The only important note is a secondary plot concerning the missing wife of Paul's probation officer; a device that seems designed only to help direct the main impulse of the story to a small and pleasant cul-de-sac. <br /> <br /> It was the French "New Wave" of the 60s that introduced the concept for the first time. From 'genre' to filming and I have always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a label system to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend the genre, or better yet, challenge it.
