'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X with the original release in 1969. There are some scenes where you can understand that, just a little. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York City to become a scam artist is sometimes a little unsettling. Dressed like a cowboy, he tries to live like a con man, making money for the act of love. It does not work as planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) cheated him for the first time and stole some money to make friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to earn some money. <br /> <br /> The movie was probably rated with X for the main theme, but in the way we see some strange things. The editing in this movie is great. We see sequences of dreams of Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a pleasant and sometimes fun way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the supporting actors provide great performances. Especially Hoffman offers some famous fine lines. The result is made by John Barry and sounds very good. All this makes this a great movie that won the Oscar for Best Picture for a good reason.
