My family has seen Arthur Bach stumble and stutter since the movie came out. We have most of the lines memorized. I saw it two weeks ago and I'm still tickled by the simple humor and vision of life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as a side kick, although I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his girlfriend's house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father is scandalous. The butler's line, "Would you mind waiting in the library" followed by Arthur's response? "Yes, I would, the bathroom is out of the question," is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny things "!
