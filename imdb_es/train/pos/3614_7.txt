Girlfight is like your grandmother's kitchen: the same old recipe you've tried a million times before, but that has somehow become something new and fresh. Try to explain the story to people who have not seen it before: a young woman on the wrong side tries to improve her situation by facing boxing while facing a bitter and obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival. Watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichés, and they're right: it's * is * cliché. However, they hypnotized me by how well this film works, due to the excellent performance and dialogue, and the sensitive direction that makes it "new". I avoided this in the cinema because it seemed like a complete shit, but do not make the same mistake as me. Definitely worth checking out.
