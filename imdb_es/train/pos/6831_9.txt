I only know another movie that could compete with Opening Night and that is the Person of Bergman. Both films are simply incredible, they have a wealth of ideas difficult to understand at first sight. We have a profound meditation on the relationship between art and life. An actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), is more in touch with the character she plays on stage than she would like. The accidental death of one of his admirers, a young woman who declares her love for Myrtle and then is hit by a car, leaves a deep impression on the actress. She begins to ask herself questions related to her aging that begin to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that does not help much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness. The scene where she kills the imaginary spirit (or not) of the dead girl is one of the most exciting scenes I found in a Cassavets movie. The film ends with a show of genius on behalf of the director while filming a theatrical scene where he and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene, as Myrtle comes too drunk on opening night to play her part accurately. This scene was filmed spontaneously, with a live audience, the laughter is genuine, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely incredible. If you liked Persona or are interested in a film that offers substantial ideas along with great entertainment, this movie will go well for you.
