I think it's unfortunate that the main comments about this film include the words "No sense and no sense". I think it's a very funny movie and excellent entertainment. You have to suspend your disbelief that a gay man and a lesbian woman can fall in love, have a child and live together happily ever after. But it's always wonderful to see it in a movie and warm the heart. Is it so impossible? There are many more unlikely events described in other films. The acting is good, the script is fun. The only negative comment is that the story may well have ended when the family moves away from their initial home instead of continuing to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality.
