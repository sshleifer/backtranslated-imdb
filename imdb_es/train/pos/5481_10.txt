For me this was more of a wake-up call, and to realize that almost everything we see, hear, read and think about almost anything depends on what the media feeds us. This is a classic example of high-level doctors trying to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people who have a constitution that they bought freely will not let themselves be carried away by this control of the media or by any attempt at erroneous information. Once again, this shows that, at the end of the day, the needs of many will in fact surpass the needs of a few. It is also enlightening to see that in a country where there is no ongoing religious civil war, democracy is not really difficult to implement.
