"Gandhi as husband and father?" It has always been discussed by people in India. 'Gandhi ... my father' is a story that only a few would have known in such detail. Undoubtedly, an idea of ​​Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the film because of its history and cinematography. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah have done a good job. Most of the scenes in the movie would be nice desktop wallpapers ... commendable work. Traditional Indian music as a background score in certain parts of the film gives a good idea of ​​what happens. <br /> <br /> However, what I did not like was the narrative style. At several points, I found the tone too dramatized. <br /> <br /> In general, good work from Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as "must-watch-once". 8/10
