Two great comedians in a great movie by Neil Simon based on his successful work. <br /> <br /> Great combination, especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. No wonder why Burns won an Oscar for this; It is as strong and fun as ever. And Matthau is his best game, even if it's a bit more uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> This is Simon's family territory: two former vaudeville partners meet for a television special but still can not stand each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> It's a delight to see these two choose each other, their scenes together make this film an absolute delight. In my case, I especially enjoyed "touch, touch, play / ENTER!" scene. And if you are a fan of Burns or Matthau, you will also enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, you will enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "sun" in your life.
