A bus full of passengers is trapped during a snowstorm. The police have closed the bridge, saying it is not safe and that they are stuck in a small cafe until the road has cleared. However, after a while, their boredom becomes worrisome, as it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and may be a foreigner. This leads to a conclusion that is ironic, but also quite funny in a low tone. <br /> <br /> This is another one of the funny episodes of The Twilight Zone. Instead of the typical turns or social comments, this does not present a lasting message. However, it is also very and visible, so who cares? Exactly WHAT happens, you will only have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this stars John Hoyt, a face that most of you will recognize from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost all cases, he played a real grump (like Charles Lane during the same time), but I loved seeing him, since he perfected the moody person and it was a funny thing at the same time.
