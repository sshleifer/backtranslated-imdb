Ireland's first animated film is also one of the best animated films I've seen in my life. It's a real wart and a different story from any of the other Oscar nominees and any other movie this year or any other. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film has the Abbot of Kells, a town in Ireland built a wall around his city to prevent the Vikings from destroying the city in case they ever attacked. His nephew Brendon, is a young monk who does the best he can, but finds his uncle's anger doing things in his own time. When a legendary illuminator Aidan arrives from a destroyed monastery, Brendon moves towards him and his warm personality. Unhappy with his uncle, Aiden offers to teach Brendon how to enlighten. To help Aidan work on his great book, saved from his destroyed monastery, Brendan goes out into the woods to look for ink-making material. While outside the walls, he meets Ashley, a forest spirit with whom he develops a friendship. Unfortunately, the abbot discovers that he left the wall and there is a hell to pay. But lurking in the distance are the Vikings ... <br /> <br /> Forget what you think you know about this movie, you're wrong. Even what I have explained does not do justice to this movie. It's a simple story with a lot more going on. This is a wonderful movie about how to try to find your way in the world, about how to reach the demons and find the beauty of the world outside the walls. (As the movie says, the world is a dangerous place and it does not stop being so even if you build walls). <br /> <br /> It is a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all of life, including darkness. There is death and destruction and joy and happiness. It is not coated with sugar. People die The monsters hide. (Scared some of the children), but in the end there is hope. Frankly, the darkness in this movie is completely different from any recent American movie. Forget about the "sadness" in a Pixar movie, this is real, it's refreshing and shows how homogenized Pixar has become. <br /> <br /> It's an animated film by Genndy Tartakovsky-esquire (Samurai Jack) Who is it? The look is based on the Celtic art of the time. It is a movie that looks like any other. Here again there is another movie that takes the picture of the film and uses it in all possible ways. The images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible. Often, the film manipulated things to look like a page in the legendary Book of Kells. It is incredibly beautiful and better described as art comes to life. <br /> <br /> Director Tomm Moore has created a film that is a masterpiece. I can not say more than that. It is a work of art. It's one of the best animation movies I've seen.
