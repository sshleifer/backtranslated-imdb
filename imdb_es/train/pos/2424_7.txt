Three hooligans get their just deserts after losing their lives in greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; This style of film always makes me wonder where reality and imagination are. Even though these people were the scum of the earth, I still found myself feeling sorry for them. They never really had many opportunities.
