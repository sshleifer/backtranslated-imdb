The Sopranos is undoubtedly the best show in the history of dramatic television. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of another series that boasts a lot of intelligence, sublime writing or top-level performances. <br /> <br /> Throughout its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Focused on the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and the nuclear family of two children; the other, a huge group of the New Jersey mafia, of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, from True Romance and The Mexican Fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also nice guy. Gandolfini must pay full praise for turning a brutal and brutally aggressive woman into a truly authentic and perfectly identifiable man. The contemporary American drama has never had such a striking and iconic figure as Tony. <br /> <br /> The cast of hundreds never boasts of having a flat performance and such outstanding personalities as Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stay in your memory forever <br /> <br /> However, the real The genius of this story is the creator and courage of the writers and the revolutionary takeover of a series of conventional drama. Twenty minutes of dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical images and scenes of truly shocking violence. However, all this style meets truly touching themes of love, honor and respect for the family. The series never becomes cold or gratuitous. <br /> <br /> With TV now competitive and, often, poor. The Sopranos stand out above the rest as the most original and compelling drama in the United States. Forget about the redifined family. This is redifined television.
