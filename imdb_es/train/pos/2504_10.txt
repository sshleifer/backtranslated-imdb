The first time I saw this movie, the first thing I thought was that this movie was more an anime than a movie. The reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. The tricks are very similar to Matrix movements, like those that move too fast for bullets and jumps too far. Another reason why the movie is good is because of the adorable anime faces that they make during the movie. The way Gackt makes his faces pucheras or simply the way they act, VERY ANIME. I think it's a very good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention that Gackt and Hyde are also a 10). ^ _ ~ If you're a Gackt and Hyde fan, you have to see it.
