This is one of the best comedies on television. The first season was hilarious like most of the following seasons. The only reason I give this show a 9/10 is due to the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the final season was the final. My favorite part of this program were the scenes that cut out people's imaginations, often representing the characters in famous television shows or movies from the 70s. It's a weird show in which I liked all the characters (with the exception of the final season ... too late to try to develop a new character and Fez was not so fun). The foot of Red in the comments of your ass never grew old, nor the stupidity of Kelso. Bravo to fox for keeping such a good show for so long, too long even.
