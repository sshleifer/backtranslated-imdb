An old vaudeville team consisting of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) was one of the best known, but they split up hating each other. More than 20 years later, they agree to meet for a TV special ... but they discover that they STILL hate each other. The nephew / agent of Willy (Richard Benjamin) tries to work together. <br /> <br /> A great success in his day and earned George Burns an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I liked it (something). It was written by Neil Simon, so it's a non-stop line. Some of that was fun, but make jokes about the senility of Willy and the NO. Also, I never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way. Also his character here is so caustic that you get tired of him quickly. Apart from that, this was fun. Burns is simply great to pull a single line easily and even Matthau was good at drawing him. His verbal battles are the best sequences of the film. Also, Benjamin is very good as Willy's nephew who tries to get both of them to work together. For me it's worth it to see it just for Burns. This jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had OTHER successes with "Oh God". Therefore, this is good. Simply good, not great. The character of Matthau really makes this hard to love. I give him a 7.
