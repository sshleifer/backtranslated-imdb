Unfortunately for me, I came across this program at the end of his life. I only captured some episodes (about three) before it was canceled by ABC. I loved the characters and the story, but especially the BIG actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters that I recognized (Bridget Moynahan was & The character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), as well as Jay Hernandez (De Carlito's Way: Rise To Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan) I like to see young actors do their duty, and I felt that this show would boost their career later. I hope that at least it will be put back on DVD, and maybe WB will remove it for a second season at some point. Meanwhile, I'm seeing it on the ABC website from the beginning.
