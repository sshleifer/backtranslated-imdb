I thought that racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear were extremely dramatized by the effect of Hollywood. I do not think the United States Navy was so openly racist. I can not imagine a full Captain, the Commander in Chief, who has told his boss to intentionally suspend someone. Certainly not at the risk of his life. And there has never been a Chief NCO who has a brazen prejudice against everyone except the WASP as the character of DeNiro. No Chief so disheveled and drunk as he was played would have promoted the Master Chief in the first place. Cuba Gooding saved an otherwise bad movie.
