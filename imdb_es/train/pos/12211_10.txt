By Hook or By Crook is a tremendously innovative film by a pair of immensely intelligent and talented filmmakers, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style, and it is beautifully filmed by Ann T. Rosetti, and it is wonderfully written: truly poetic. <br /> <br /> The main characters are true heroes and serve as a rare type of model / inspiration for dykes and transsexuals from around the world. This movie has so much energy, so much touching passion and the disheveled heart of San Francisco. I can not recommend enough! <br /> <br /> The best Butch Buddy movie of all time!
