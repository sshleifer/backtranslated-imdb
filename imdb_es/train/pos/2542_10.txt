With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) demonstrates successfully that years ago, a meteor landed in Africa that contained an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", even more powerful than radio and very radioactive, and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone just by touching him. The sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science fiction movie during the post-World War II era. Director Hillyer used some foot games from the "FLASH GORDON" series that was shot at the same time and also inserted some images of Frankenstein electric machines. Universal kept the public unaware of the special effects that are used in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were at their best and both enjoyed working together and will enjoy it for future generations.
