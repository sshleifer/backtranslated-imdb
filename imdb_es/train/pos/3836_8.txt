Extremely interesting and intriguing movie. The similarities with David Lynch (who is even cited literally by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the housekeeper in this film is called Mrs. Grubach, like that of Der Prozess .. .) are clearly present, but in this case they are accompanied by clear references to Belgium's colonial past in Africa. The exact content of the film can not be clearly described: this colonialism is an important part, as is the inability to face that past, but the personal memories of the main character are also a central theme, and their search for social life. contact and love These are the symbolic themes that I deduced from the film, but in reality they are nothing more than impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you will still discover an extremely fascinating film full of splendid images (beautiful close-ups of beatles, larvae and other unpleasant insects alternate with large sequences of dreams and also the dark atmosphere gives the extra style of the film). Maybe I can say that I did not "understand" the movie, but I've been watching as hypnotized for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the mysterious mysteriousness.
