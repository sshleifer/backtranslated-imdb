As I said at the top, four stars are not enough. It's one of the best movies I've seen in my almost 17 years of life. For people who do not really like it or do not understand it, you should not have a real appreciation for the art or you could have a short attention span. <br /> <br /> Even if I have not seen all your movies yet, I must say that this is Spielberg at its peak. It is very sad to see that such great movies as "The Color Purple" do not appear very often because I believe that all of us have a desperate need for first class entertainment in these difficult times. <br /> <br /> Movies like this are more than just movies; They are pieces of art that need to be appreciated more. <br /> <br /> The idea that she was nominated for 11 Oscars (including Best Picture of the Year) and did not get a trophy is a sign of how Hollywood can be blind and stupid at times. Spielberg was not even nominated for Best Director! I should have won the Oscars that year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows how unfair life is for some people. <br /> <br /> If only the movies were still so good ...
