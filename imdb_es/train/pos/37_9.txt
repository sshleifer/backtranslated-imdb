Of the elements that make this the best at this point, I have to say that # 1 is Christine McIntire. The scene of Shemp when she is poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent. I imagine that, as suggested by a poster, Christine tried to contain the laughter during that scene, but in reality it made her look even more deliciously wicked, when smiling at the possible death of Shemp. <br /> <br /> Another character that helps make this stand out the Goon. His look was a great cross between the horrific and comical goof-ball. Just a character I would choose to find in a dark alley or, for that matter, anywhere. I would have preferred a bit of real whodunit mystery in this, but hey, when a little bit is so good, who is going to complain. I do not.
