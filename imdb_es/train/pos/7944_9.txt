Do you ever, or do you have, a pet that has been with you far and wide, with whom you would be lost and who you love no matter what? Betcha never thought they feel the same for you! <br /> <br /> Wonderful, wonderful family movie. If you have a weakness for animals, this will make you cry no matter your age. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a kid, and it seems to me that now, at sixteen, I love it as much as I did then. I could never decide on a favorite character then, and I still do not think I can! I love the three animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving family, but in conflict. I love Chance, and how in the end he says he finally has a family. Cheesy, yes, but you have to remember that this is a family movie, and perfectly fulfills that role. Sassy has the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect leader / model for the young and adventurous Chance. <br /> <br /> Animals eclipse humans, but, of course, most tearful moments are to be had during an interaction with them (ie, rescuing Molly and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives every moment even more excitement and a feeling of accompanying swelling of the heart. I give you this 9/10. To be compared to (and even rated better than) Cats and Dogs and Babe.
