The idea is a very intelligent title, since the film has a serious feeling. But it's so subtle that you do not know how to read it! Are these guys doing a full comedy or is there something else at stake? The small dialogue that the film has is not very delicate and this adds to the power of the film. If all the sound went out of the movie, it would not really take anything away from the movie. The physical actions or the art of showing are so strong that they alone carry the totality of the story. <br /> <br /> I am a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame. First I say this movie as part of a "black" film festival. After watching the movie I was very impressed with the work. But then I asked myself what's next? Where can someone see this work? The common association of art without purpose is not found here. You can see the intention in the design from the beginning to the end. The use of African music, the style of casting everything seems planned and for a reason. The development of the character is amazing. The casting I think is the strongest aspect of the film; the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes from the 6 minutes of the actual movie. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of these types of films, there really should be more support for the development of short films around the world. board.
