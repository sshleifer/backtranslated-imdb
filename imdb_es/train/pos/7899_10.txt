['This was an excellent movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There was so much in this to connect, so many beautiful images and so much compassion in things that were not said. I entertained myself a lot and I left with a feeling of exuberant joy, just as I am when I finish almost any story of Tom Robbins. Now I have not read this particular book by Robbin, so now I do not know how it was combined, but I can not imagine that this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. The movie left a lot for you to define, which is the best part of any Tom Robbins novel, dreaming the details. <br /><br /> For all of you who said that this was the worst movie in history, I feel sorry for the little that remains of the dim light in their hearts. Far from the worst, this movie was glorious. Long live the crane!']
