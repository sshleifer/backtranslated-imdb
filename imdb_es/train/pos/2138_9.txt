This film revolves around Japanese culture and the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7 years of age (especially in public), therefore, all of this is leaning rather than embracing even when they are close friends or relatives. Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around another person and also in public. Never the less ballroom dancing is (in the sense quite) immensely popular. People who do ballroom dancing in Japan are seen a bit like nudists in the west ... many more would like to do it, but culture inhibits them. A lovely family movie, that any amateur dancer would enjoy just for the dance sequences. I understand that it was more popular than the Titanic in Japan. I suppose the Japanese are like the rest of us, they also like to be hugged.
