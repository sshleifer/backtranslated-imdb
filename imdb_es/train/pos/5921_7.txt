I was the production accountant in this film, and I was also able to do a voice-over job, so I'm not entirely impartial, but if it was horrible, I would say so. I thought it was a funny movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, by any means, but there was a lot of laughter along the way. The Bible says that laughter does well as a medicine, so watching this movie could be good for your health. <br /> <br /> Therefore, many of the actors in this image had not yet peaked at the time we made this movie. Susan Sarandon, of course, is one who has since achieved a much greater fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on television weekly as a photographer on the television drama series "Thirty-Something." Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, who still pursues people's dreams. One of my favorite actors in this program was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedy actor, and a truly nice and sincere person. We all have fun working on this program, and I think the fun comes.
