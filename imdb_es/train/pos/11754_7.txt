Robin Williams goes out of his way to combine comedy and pathos, but he is a little sharp. Donald Moffat is a single note like his father-in-law. Although Jeff Bridges is excellent as the quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful, taking the film through most of its difficult points. It fills the time very well, but it is little more than that.
