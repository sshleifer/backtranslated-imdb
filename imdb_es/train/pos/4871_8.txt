It takes a Serbian or at least Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as many other Kusturica films. See, for example, the initial scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the communist government and the awakening of the young brat watching her teacher naked in the sounds of the Soviet anthem. Kusturica not only tries to get away from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous films, but he creates a whole world of himself in the process. <br /> <br /> This is not a political movie or it is not an explicit political movie in any case. It's a fun movie first of all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that interest us. Music plays an active role in this movie as it does in all its other films. His style is direct and grotesque, now we know what he feels for his characters and we know he wants us to feel the same. The space he develops combines present music, history and magic, and the colors seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie either. The main defect is the length, some editions and shortening would have been useful, since at some point the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions appear. It is still one of the most attractive, funny and moving movies I've seen lately.
