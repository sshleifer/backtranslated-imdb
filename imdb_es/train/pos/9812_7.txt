"The big goodbye" presents us with the first holodeck adventure, in this case, Captain Picard poses as private investigator Dixon Hill. These episodes create some kind of standard pattern, repeated several times in TNG, as well as in DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck, something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program in different circumstances beyond playing a game (represented by the failure of the holodeck security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to expand the possibility of Star Trek and allow a kind of gender mix. Picard's stories on Dixon Hill are examples of the criminal fiction of the 1940s and its depiction on the screen is known as Film Noir, which often has the antihero stereotype at its head (see for example the Chandler stories in Marlowe or the classic "Chinatown" of Polanski). Star Trek never focuses on the story (mostly it's a simple "how to get out of here" scenario), but allows the actors to take a different approach to their characters. These "games" Holodeck are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected and, from that point of view, the stories are never solid (but if Star Trek had some technical and scientific point, I mean, in addition to some utopian concepts). <br /> <br /> "The big goodbye" shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart, a McFadden who almost never looked better in an episode of Star Trek (at least in the first ones) and Data also has some great scenes (although I it's hard to believe that pulling the lamp out of the wall would really have surprised him, since he had researched that period and its customs). Wesley continues to turn the peaceful Trekkies into possible killers (why did not they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off?), But all this is fun ...
