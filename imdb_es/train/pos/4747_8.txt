Anyone who has never seen anything like the fight scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The fight scenes were choreographed by the action scene psycho Yuen Woo Ping, who also did the fights in The Matrix. And the fight scenes are something like that. <br /> <br /> Li plays a supersoldier who does not feel pain, who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian (you understand me). When other evil supersoldiers begin to kill local drug traffickers to take over the drug trade, Li joins his fellow police officer to help stop them. <br /> <br /> There are some absolutely crazy things in this movie (a badguy cuts his arm off with a glass panel and barely notices) The fight scenes are full of flying kicks and punches; The counting of bodies It's very high up Li has rarely been better, and has surrounded himself with a group of beautiful female costars (Yip kicks a serious ass like a supersoldier companion) Anthony Wong even makes a cameo like a drug lord (no surprises there, he makes a cameo in every HK movie.) It's unfortunate that they do not do action movies like this in the United States, I would not have to go through all these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action I so desire.
