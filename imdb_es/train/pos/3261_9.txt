['Nay Sayers of this movie is probably embittered by a love that is seriously unrequited. This is a great movie for anyone able to understand the song of Johnny Mathis, or any song from that era: Bobby Darin, Beyond the Sea ... or Stan Getz, The Girl From Ipanema, et al ... <br /><br /> I measure the films for the number of times I have to see them before I am satisfied ... The most probable thing is that he has given me back some good moments. <br /><br /> I also see the synergy between the cast ... I thought they worked well together. <br /><br /> Open your heart and let the comic magic of the movie transport you. <br /><br /> Alan']
