['A happy comedy, Nada shows us a world that we sometimes want to escape: a world of nothing. Anything you do not like, be it a pile of bills, a bad memory or even hunger may disappear in your desire. They approached this movie very well, and with a nice duo protagonist, there were only some things that I did not like about Nothing, and they were not even part of the main movie. <br /><br /> First, the scene after the credits (and yes, there is one): good to laugh, but what were you trying to achieve with that? I was confused and anxious to see a return to something after a complete movie of nothing. Instead, we only hear a random assortment of noises and they scream. In my opinion, try to establish a sequel, and it was not really necessary, nor was it funny after the turtle left the frame. <br /><br /> Second, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD, and as others have already said, it promotes a horror movie that never came. Oh well, poor marketing, I suppose. <br /><br /> If you see this in your movie rental shop, take a look, because Nada is a great movie to watch. However, if you have a large screen, you may want to use shadows.']
