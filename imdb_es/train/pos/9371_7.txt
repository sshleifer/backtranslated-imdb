One thing I've always liked about Robert Ludlum's thrillers is that, when you think you've discovered it, it goes in a completely different direction. There are so many twists and turns in this movie that my neck hurts to see. <br /> <br /> One thing I also like about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that it could be depended on directing and, in this case, writing (with his brother Rick) a good story . <br /> <br /> Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if you are playing characters that all of them have perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the best in people, and this will keep you interested and guesses until the end.
