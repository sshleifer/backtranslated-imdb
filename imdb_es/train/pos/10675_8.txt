I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time, being a fan of Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic secondary plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through this juvie role. Thank God for Turner Classic, who aired the show last week. I can imagine that there were many problems with children after the war, especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s. Some of the guys are a little scared. I certainly would not want to find them on a well-lit street, much less dark. There were also some good ideas about the feelings of a firebug, or as they call it, a firefly.
