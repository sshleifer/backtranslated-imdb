Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a game h. Somehow, the producers turned it into a successful series with nothing of h-stuff. It could not have been otherwise because the development of the characters is excellent as shown in this series and any alteration of that could ruin perfection. (You will understand it once you see all the episodes). <Br /> <br /> Despite a relatively slow start (the producer took his time to introduce the characters) things quickly gain momentum and shortly after the middle of the series the action becomes so intense that you Stick to your seat. <br /> <br /> The theme of the series focuses on the Holy Grail War that has taken place in the city of Fukuky for the past 50 years. The pilot really begins with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that began during the last battle and enveloped a large part of the city. Reluctantly he witnesses a fight between two Servants who shoots his Reiju (Holy Mark) to summon one of the most powerful Servants of the battlefield. Knowing His first contact with Saber left him stunned: "Such an immeasurable beauty ... I was speechless". <br /> <br /> You should not compare this series with any other to fully understand its plot. FSN offers much more than some great sword fights, a good animation, spectacular lights, a great soundtrack, offers an excellent development of characters and relationships. It presents the changes that take place within the personalities of the characters as the events precipitate. The action reveals individuals' credible emotional and behavioral patterns (which are not similar to the type of linear use used by other series) that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal, from below the mask of perfection, imperfect characters. <br /> <br /> The character of Saber is linked to a medieval legend that has been modified to fit this series and must be accepted as such. You should not see FSN thinking that it does not present the spectator with the historical fact, just remember that this is a series of adventures / fantasy and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can. The ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes I would have seen them in the same breath.
