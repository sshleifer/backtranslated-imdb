I thought that this movie did a good job. It was not as creative or original as the first, but who expected it. It was fun. The more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it comes out on DVD, I'm going to pay the money with a lot of pride, every last penny. Sharon Stone is great, always is, even if her movie is horrible (Catwoman), but this movie is not, this is one of those movies that will be underestimated for life, and probably will become a classic in 20 years No wait for it to be a classic, look at it now and enjoy it. Do not expect a masterpiece, or something that is moving and touching, just allow yourself to leave your life and participate in theirs. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is entertaining and I recommend people who have not seen it to see it, because what critics and box office say does not always count, you see it for yourself, you never know , you can simply enjoy it. I take my hat off this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
