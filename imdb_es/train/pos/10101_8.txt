Dominion tank police is a contradictory filming exercise. The story throughout the 4 parts combines senseless action, slap-stick humor, touching humanity and philosophical questions that provoke thought. It is hard to believe that there was only one director, since the style changes from one episode to another. A movie that must be seen for anyone who likes anime.
