I saw it for the first time at a foreign film festival. It is a beautiful rhythm nailer on a plot to free the Estonian treasury of about a billion dollars in gold. Everything is filmed in a grainy, gritty style that Hollywood seldom uses, but captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states beautifully (note: Tallin actually looked a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there). <Br /> <br /> There's also a lot of humor and some romance. I do not want to ruin a number of logical but surprising surprises, so I'll just say that this theft movie starts with a great script, and the direction and performances are first class. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most stressful example of its kind: I compared it with RAFIFI, TOPKAPI and it is way ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, although (deliberately) it is not so bright. RENT OR BUY IT NOW.
