`The United States of Kiss My Ass' <br /> <br /> House of Games is the directional debut of playwright David Mamet and is an effective and sometimes surprising psychological thriller. It stars Lindsay Crouse as the best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the player who has taken one of his patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so, he leaves behind the security and comfort of his somewhat ordinary life and travels to the city center to visit the place of the underworld, House of Games. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the player Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) is a little sharp and cunning. He offers a deal to Crouse's character, if she is willing to sit with him in a game, a great money game in the back room, he will cancel the debts of the patients. The card game is produced and soon it is seen that the psychiatrist and the player are in a line of family work (earning the trust of others) and begins a fascinating relationship. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential vision for any movie buff is the constant divination of who is in control, be it the psychiatrist or the swindler, or the well-known man of big lights David Mamet. <Br /> <br /> At House of Games, the direction is boring and most of the time it's flat and uninspiring, however, in every David Mamet movie, the story is central to the whole process, not the address. In House of Games, this shines in part thanks to the excellent performances of the two protagonists (flashy and distracted), but mainly as it happens with much of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue that catches you and slowly introduces you into the film . . Nobody in the House of the Games says what they want to say and the conversations become battlefields and war of words. All braggers and double bluffs, reminiscent of a natural order of poker games. This is a running theme throughout the film and is used with great effect at the right times to create large amounts of tension. House of Games can also be seen as a movie from the class war division. With Lindsay Crouse we have the well-educated middle-class psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the opposite, the working class of America makes a living with an "honest" crime. <br /> <br /> The seductive film Mantegna seduces the viewer like Crouse and the end result is, ultimately, a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the end of the film is definitely something that everyone should see and keep in mind, it's impressive. <br /> <br /> An extremely enjoyable cinematic experience that is worth seeing repeatedly. 9/10
