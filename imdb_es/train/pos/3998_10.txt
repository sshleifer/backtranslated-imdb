Somehow I missed this movie when it came out and I discovered it until last week thanks to the recommendation of a friend. I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate dramatic film, which does so many things so well. The writing is clear, realistic, nuanced and even restricted. Cinematography and editing are simple but inspired, allowing visual narration to dominate through wonderful close-ups and framing of images, capturing loneliness and alienation in the most memorable way. The acting is also wonderful, as all the characters become painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling way a movie can offer. They reveal their most intimate weaknesses with an unprotected and raw vulnerability. A true triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi, and the rest of the team. A must for serious movie lovers.
