Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacular movie, but it left a bitter taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the other hand, is a little less polished, but it's a much better movie. This is a historical film that combines timeless themes with truly historical values, while Braveheart put a rude and unpleasant contemporary glow in an old story. What makes this movie is the cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in a role he basically repeated (in a diluted way) in the ghost threat. The character is heroic, but he is neither the best fighter nor the most demonic lover. Admirable but human, send the screen. Against him a selection of equally human adversaries is established, including Tim Roth's Cunningham, odious but brilliant, and John Hurt's bankrupt laird in bankruptcy. Also to praise Jessica Lange, as Rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, which is as it should be. This is not the most original film you will see, but it has the courage of your own convictions, and the good results make you care.
