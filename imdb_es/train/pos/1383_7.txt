The original title means "The birth of the octopus". I must confess that I do not understand this title very well. The title in English is "Lilies of water". But after writing this, I read the comment of another user: "The title in French is also suggestive:" prieuve ", or octopus, suggests that an individual has to juggle with many pressures simultaneously". Thanks for your explanation. <br /> <br /> The basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, when it is not clear if they are directed to the same sex or the other. It's not different for boys. I think both Floriane and Marie will have heterosexual feelings without any mix. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is water ballet. Sometimes the girls have their heads down, and nothing above the water, except the lower feet and legs, with which they will move and kick in the air. For people like me who had never seen such things before, it was fascinating. - Floriane is the leader of a team of "water lilies". <br /> <br /> Marie tells her that she would like to see when Floriane is training. This seems to be his first contact that is not only ordinary. Soon they will walk together. Floriane takes Marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her, and then leaves with him for an hour, while Marie waits for her to return. I took it for granted that the couple slept with each other. But then we will learn from the movie that they do less than that. <br /> <br /> I can provide information that few users will find elsewhere. There is a scene in which Marie secretly steals Floriane's garbage bag. In it he finds an apple, mostly food. And Marie proceeds to eat the rest. ?? There is a parallel scene in another film, "Kazetachi no gogo" (Brisas de la tarde) by Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980). They are young adult women, and a clearly lesbian woman is in vain in love with a heterosexual woman. She also steals a garbage bag from the beloved, and also finds an apple more or less food and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Then, Floriane tells Marie that she would like to have her first orgasm. Marie says she can not do this. <br /> <br /> But even later, Marie says she is willing to do it. And she masturbates in floriane. There is no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Probably, only one director could have made a show or psychological study as good as ?? I would like to quote Baudelaire, "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Do Adonaan to Floriane played by Ad√®le Haenel, who did the excellent performance of the autistic girl in "The Little Devils" by Christophe Ruggia (2002)? ? A very underestimated movie.
