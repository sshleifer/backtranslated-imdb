['This is one of the most interesting movies I&#39;ve seen in my life. I love the atmosphere of this movie. The movie is very realistic and credible. This seems to happen at another time, perhaps in the late 60&#39;s or early 70&#39;s. Henry Thomas works well with the baby. Very moving story and it&#39;s worth checking out.']
