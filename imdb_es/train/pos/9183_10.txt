This wonderful BBC television production of 1983 (not a movie, as others have written here) of the classic love story "Jane Eyre", starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester, and Zelah Clarke as Jane, is the best version that is has done to date. Since it is the most faithful to Charlotte Bronte's novel both in concept and in dialogue. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; When movie producers begin to intrude into the life of a classic, that classic is destroyed. Fortunately, ESTA "Jane Eyre" producers approached the story with respect and fidelity to the original, resulting in a spectacularly addictive combination that is worth seeing several times, to enjoy its multiple layers of sweetness, delight and suspense. The performances are lovely, the music is perfect, even the gothic design of the house and the outdoor shots are beautiful and set the tone for the production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism, although slight, is that this version, like all other versions of Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation would not think twice, but stay with Rochester after discovering that she had an insane wife and was still married to her. "Oh, just get divorced," he would say to his man, or he would live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knew that she could not settle for this course in life and respect herself. Why? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith that had taught her since childhood, not the brutal Calvinist Lowood institution, but the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was martyred instead of turning the other cheek . Someday I would like to see some version that describes these influences a bit more in an adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing "Even so, come Lord Jesus!" The foundations of that faith must not be removed.
