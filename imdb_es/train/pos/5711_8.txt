At Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the great film directors and great pioneers, created a light comedy gem that, despite its lightness, is an innovative and technically brilliant film that clearly influenced later filmmakers such as Marx Brothers, Lubitsch , and mamoulian. The plot, an ingenious story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot but has to frantically search the lost ticket throughout the city, is basically a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comic scenes depicted in a world of dream. The imagination of the director. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things about this film is that, although it is located in the center of Paris and does not include anything really impossible, it achieves a continuous and fantasy fairy-tale atmosphere. , in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they talk, or that a fight for a stolen jacket should take the form of a football game. Another memorable element is that Le Million includes what may be the funniest opera ever filmed (Oh, that blonde braid soprano! "I laugh, ha! Ha!"). Casting is also a delight: Clair has assembled a group of incredible, very different characters, each of them illustrating with a deadly satirical precision a French "bourgeois" type, so that the film looks like a set of engravings of Daumier that come alive. <br /> <br /> Hilarity takes a little time To begin, I found that the characters are not as emotionally attractive as they can be in a light comedy (as they are, for example, in many Lubitsch films). For these reasons, I refrained from giving it the highest rating. But these little viewers should not distract from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Should you see it? By all means. Highly recommended if you want a classic and influential film or simply a funny comedy.
