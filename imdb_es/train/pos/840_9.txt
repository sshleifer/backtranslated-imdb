I was not sure what to expect from this movie. I love seeing Brosnan in any movie, it's always good, but this was totally different. It's a mess, and it plays a very good mess. In fact, it reminded me a couple of times in the university :) So, yes, there is not much violence, there is not much action, but the dialogue is cracking, the performance is excellent and very refreshing, and it's pretty funny also :) I do not think that you leave the cinema saying "Wow! I was impressed", but you will leave smiling after having enjoyed a good movie. I can not ask for more than that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, an imbecile will put the ad in the wrong and it will be reversed, upside down, inverted (with inverted audio) ads !! Sparkly. There's nothing like seeing an ad by Jack Daniels where the drink comes back to the glass bottle with a rough comment from "Twin Peaks" American :)
