['I participated in a small mini production of this when I was 8 years old in school and my mother bought me the video. Since then I&#39;ve loved it! When I was younger, I enjoyed the songs and the spectacular dance sequences, but since I saw them when I grew up, I appreciate more the fantastic performance and the representation of the characters. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. The Nancy of Shani Wallis is the best character for me. He endured so much for those guys, I think he&#39;s such a strong character and his final scene when ... Well, you know ... He always makes me cry! The best musical in my opinion of all time. It lasted all this time, it will live for many more years! 11/10 !!']
