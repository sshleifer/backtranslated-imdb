This Hong Kong filmed potboiler packages in more melodrama than the value of 'The Young & The Restless' of the week. This is more a throwback to the original 'Emmanuelle' trilogy (especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') than a D'Amato sleazefest. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) undergoes an amazing transformation from severe nursing to street stalker. The future Italian star / politician, Illona Staller, who would later be called Ciccolina (and will have sex with a positive HIV, John Holmes) plays Emy's competition. Exotic locales and some decent soft-core scenes complete this. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle', of which I am one!
