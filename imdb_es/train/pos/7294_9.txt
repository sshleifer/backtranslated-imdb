After reading several comments, I felt that I also had to add my two cents. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts that I think I've seen. I had the opportunity to see this at the Independent Film Festival of New York. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and moving. The story was beautifully complex, especially for such a short time. The story centers on a young woman who is a victim of her abusive father. Soon he is given the option to "stop him" by a demon played by "Eric Etebari of Witchblade". After watching the program, I was greatly surprised by the way he played a character so unique and different. I never knew that he could act so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. The performance was absolutely magnificent for him. The girl was fine and the father's was decent. There is also death in this, which follows the girl until she can escape her future. The effects and the cinematography were absolutely amazing. I wonder if they would have at least a hundred thousand budget for this. It is rare that you get to see a short of such high quality. The opening was absolutely impressive comparable with any major movie. This does not mean that it is not free of defects, I thought it took a while to get going and that the introduction was a bit long. But this stayed in my head days after I saw it. There are very few shorts with this level of quality.
