['It was by chance that I was scanning the television channels and I found this wonderful movie about two beautiful human beings who are attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin approach as one another. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) &quot;Tape&quot; &#39;01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) &quot;ER&quot; 94 TV Series (Nicole). This boy and this girl will warm your heart and your soul and make you think deeply about your past relationships and how you would really like to have followed the strings of your heart with a boy or girl that you loved so much and have lost sight of throughout years. Jesse and Celine have a great conversation and a deep eye contact with a large magnetic explosion between the two. I look forward to the SEQUENCE of this film in 2004 and, if you have seen it, you will feel the same way.']
