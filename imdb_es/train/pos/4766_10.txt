It is unusual to see a movie in which the performance of a single actor is so good that you can feel that the film would be of little interest, if any, without your presence. <br /> <br /> Despite an uncharacteristic direction - in fact, there are many scenes that seem to have been filmed too quickly and carelessly - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot about a man who wants to occupy the Instead of an ousted priest and another week of points, the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that one is surprised from the beginning to the terrible end. <br /> <br /> I have never seen nor can I imagine a better performance in the future, including Paul Scofield acting in "A man for all seasons". <br /> <br /> Actually, the ending could be considered even ridiculous if Fresnay was not playing the transtorned priest who returns to the Church performing a crime. <br /> <br /> "Je suis Maurice Morand, prètre catholique" ("I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest") is said with such brilliance that one can forget the madman. The other impressive thing that this film has is a unique scene in which Morand, who despite being a defrock is still a priest, is consecrated in a cabaret with a huge amount of vid. turning it into the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gérard, the man who wants to return Morand to the Church or replace him by himself, must drink it if he does not want to leave him in the cabaret. . He does so amidst cheers and applause from people who think that he is simply drinking three of the four litters of vine. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the dialogue between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable. "Do you also take the men?" asks Morand, who hates himself for what he has just done. "That would be too much work" is the intelligent answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is not worth commenting on, but it is certainly worth seeing because of the very strong and strangely emotional atmosphere that is created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think "Le défroqué" is a very strange movie, but it must be seen by all the spectators, if they are good Catholics, it is obligatory, because it is a very rare jewel in the history of cinema. <br /> <br />
