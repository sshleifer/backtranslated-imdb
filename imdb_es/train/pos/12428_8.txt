I enjoyed this movie. Unlike some of the steroid trash cans that are passed as action movies, Playing God is simple and realistic, with credible characters, actions that are not overdone and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end. . <br /> <br /> Well directed, well acted and a good story.
