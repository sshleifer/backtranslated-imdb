This is the caricature I should have won instead of Country Cousin. Visually well done and much more entertaining and memorable. It's worth seeing just for the music alone! Although there are elements that will undoubtedly damage the sensibility of some of these days, it is necessary to give a little perspective to the caricature. He is over sixty years old and, after all, is just a caricature. I am incapacitated and if I were as hypersensitive as people who see things like this caricature and are offended, I would have long ago curled up in a fetal position and vanished. Sometimes you need to lighten, put your head back and float! Celebrity cartoons in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering. Bing Crosby hated it when they used it on more than one occasion. *SIGH*
