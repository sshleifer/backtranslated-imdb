Basically, I like the Verhoeven movie because in his movie I enjoy a brilliant psychosexual story that I've seen before in "Basic Instinct." It's really a wonderful suspense movie that I enjoyed a lot. Therefore, it is obviously for me to see this other Verhoeven movie. <br /> <br /> Well, it's your previous address before your blockbuster hit "Basic Instinct" and that's why I was very curious to see that movie and yes, the film has fulfilled my hope and my expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant psychosexual drama that is a bit complex for some audiences. The story of this film is about a gay writer named "Reve" (Krabbe), an alcoholic who lives by his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that can warn him of a future accident. After the end of your lecture, introduce a seductive woman named "Christine", who has a mysterious past that she does not want to reveal. Keep making love with her at home since she is a child. The next morning, he looks at the picture of his sexy and macho boyfriend at his table. , the person he met at the station. He is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to his house. <br /> <br /> that's it. I do not want to reveal the whole story because it's a Verhoeven movie and the end of the movie is really amazing! <br /> <br /> especially, I like the character "Reve", played brilliantly by "Krabbe". Basically, I like his performance because, as a gay person, I am purely identified with his character and yes, I like his charming face. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mr. Verhoeven for making such a black comedy. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie: 10 out of 10.
