['This is the second part of &#39;The Animatrix&#39;, a collection of animated short films that tell us a little more about the world of &#39;The Matrix&#39;. <br /><br /> In this we learn how men and machines can not work and live together. It&#39;s a little history lesson in the world of &#39;The Matrix&#39;. It&#39;s not as good as the first part (&#39;The final flight of Osiris&#39;), but it&#39;s still quite entertaining.']
