"If I wanted to dribble, I'd call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Have not you had enough?" ... "More than enough". <br /> <br /> "You got me a choo-choo". <br /> <br /> "If I start to die, please remove (the cowboy hat) from My head, that's not how I want to be remembered." <br /> <br /> Some of the wonderfully humorous and, often, insightful quotes from this charming and often insightful movie. Dudley Moore is charming, kind and rich. Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. The two have a non-father / father and son relationship that defines the man Arthur will become. Will his heart and soul, or only his wealth, follow? Over the course of twenty-five years, I have returned to this film with joy, fun and joy. It is a film to return, again and again, and remember what is important in life, however brief it may be. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
