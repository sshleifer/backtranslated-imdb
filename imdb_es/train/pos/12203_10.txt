"The Lady From Shanghai" by Orson Welles does not have the brilliant script of "Citizen Kane", for example, but the cinematography of Charles Lawton, Jr., the unforgettable pieces (like the scene in the aquarium, the maritime scene that presents a awesome, blonde Tressed Rita Hayworth singing "Please, do not love me", and the truly incredible climax of Hall of Mirrors), and the wonderful cast (Everett Sloane at his best performance, Welles in a beautifully played role, the aforementioned Miss Hayworth: Welles' wife at that moment, at its most beautiful moment, is a memorable experience.The strange plot of the mystery of murder is funny and convincing, nothing inscrutable.The viewer is surprised by the twists and turns, and the line of Welles' closing is an unheralded classic. "The Lady of Shanghai" gets four stars from this impartial referee.
