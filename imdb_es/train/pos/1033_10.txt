Say what you want about schmaltz. One beauty of this movie is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality that some Americans have been called to a high purpose and how they came to the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (the mother and brother of Bette Davis). As Fanny says, "We have been shaken from the magnolias." <br /> <br /> In today's political climate, where, led by a president who blatantly lied to us and used 9/11 to bring out the worst of the absolute. characteristics of human beings, we sink to the level of the killers of 9/11 to seek revenge thirsting for blood. You can not blame Mr. Bush; After all, we allowed him to guide us in that direction and we even re-elected him after his lies had been exposed. Now, with a complete justification, we Americans are vilified around the world. <br /> <br /> Today, we see this film with a new awareness: that the rise to power of the Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw in the German character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that justifies our committing immoral and atrocious acts. I'm not comparing George Bush with Adolph Hitler. But, I am pointing out how a leader can turn us into a frenzy of terror, hatred and hypernationalism to do despicable things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the blackmailer, who will do whatever it takes. made for its own enlargement, no matter how immoral it is, it is more like the leaders of our country, those who support them and those who have buried their heads so deeply in the sand that they can not even be bothered to vote. <br /> <br /> A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be, a force for the betterment of humanity, and that we have in ourselves once again aspire to lofty goals. <br /> <br /> Geoff
