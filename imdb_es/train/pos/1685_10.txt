The first time I saw this movie was around 1990, and he died absolutely laughing through it. He became a cult favorite with my circle of friends, and we quoted him in the blink of an eye ("I'm going home in a bag!"). Needless to say, the humor is still there, 15 years later. It has become a tradition in the Halloween season to expose many of my new friends to this movie (well, you can still buy it on Ebay!). I discovered that Halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue firmly planted on your cheek ... and this film provides everything: pathos, suspense, unrequited love, nobility and the list goes on. Royal Dano offers an incredible and sincere performance as Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad guy who had a bad ending. Here, you really feel for the old man from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you're not careful, you'll miss some of the humor levels in this movie. The creators became very subtle in many ways with unforeseen comments, small excavations of costumes in other science fiction movies, and even a scene torn from the pages of Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Do not spend too much! many thought processes that try to analyze a movie, people: this is a fun meal without the need of meticulousness, and should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they will not know that they make fun of them ...) . <br /> <br /> -Now if you'll excuse me, I'll look for a 'Zag-nut' bar ... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, DJ karaoke / animator
