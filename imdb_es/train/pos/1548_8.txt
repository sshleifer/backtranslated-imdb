Luckily, not knowing anything about this movie, I had the curiosity to record it from the television. And then, the tape was sold out just five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I got most of it because this is a great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and the slightly misty plots, but also very scary and even daring moments. Considering the year of production of 1969, some slight nuances of lesbians must have raised some eyebrows. Of course, now it does not surprise anyone and, in fact, those scenes seem very well done. And it's not just about the two actresses of George. <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to hit all the spectators with great force, it's no wonder, and it certainly hit me. Highly effective. In addition, the views of both sides of the opponents give the whole story more depth throughout the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic war story of a victorious side, but it shows what is behind victory in good and evil. Well, being a case of war, mostly bad. <br /> <br /> For the fans of the composer Ennio Morricone this is also a necessity. His work is always excellent, touching but never exaggerated. And I think I have to try to capture more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! Hopefully they get this on DVD soon, so I can have the full movie in my collection and more people become familiar with this little-known gem.
