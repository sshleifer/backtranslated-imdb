I must say that, as a BSG fan, I was not quite sure what I would think about this program. Tonight I saw him on the big screen of the Arclight cinema (as part of the Paley Center screenings), and the cast and the filmmakers talked later. Ron Moore said that "they wanted to make a clean break with Battlestar and do something different, and they would lose some fans, but hopefully they would win others". <br /> <br /> Even without your conversation, I am now a fan of the new program. But this is what I thought of the movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it. It was really very good. I guess I'm a true science fiction (or 'syfy', do I really have to write that?) Geek, because I would see it totally as a series, it has a strong and rich story, and it kept my interest. <br /> <br /> It starts with a small group of teenagers who were planning something, which for me was the weakest and a bit confusing part.The actor who plays "Ben" should have given us a closer look at his intense beliefs.The actress who plays " Zoe "looked like a little bouquet, but she was playing with a teenager (and I'm sure I will not be the only one who thought" Zoe "was a Cylon at the beginning, what could be a geek BSG). the new Bamber / Helfer / Park, perhaps they want to rethink it Surprisi Instead, it was the adults who attracted the attention of the public. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz offers a stellar performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so obsessed for the tragedy of his family that does not let the First chance to get out of your sorrow and not let go. She does a chilling and passionate job of transmitting her character's shrewd knowledge about the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene where she paints a network for her daughters' teenage friend, catches her, dismisses her and free it There is no trace of the "serial killer" he played in Gray's Anatomy, a really impressive performance. <br /> <br /> As strong as Paúl Malcomson is as strong as his wife Amanda Greystone. She is so intelligent and well written and beautifully interpreted as the part of Stoltz, and completely believed that they are a couple, and a couple that has been together forever and has a strong relationship, something that is rarely seen these days. I hope to see what happens with this family, and I hope that they give as much to do as Roslin in BSG. She is strong and intelligent and when she attacks her daughter, you shrug, it's really great. Not to mention his eyes, which might contain magical powers, that's how intense they are. The scene in which he faces the government agent, very short, but beautifully interpreted, really gives you an idea of ​​his power. <br /> <br /> The other part of the program that did not work 100% for me was The scenes with Esai Morales, and the mafioso type of his clan. He does a good job in general, but he did not believe in the power of this mafia, nor was he intimidated by his threats. I found myself wishing that this whole story was a little more mysterious and difficult to understand; The way it is presented is almost a tribute to the Godfather, they hit you a little in the head. But over time, I can see how this will become a kind of interesting thing "Up / down" with the poor minorities (Morales et al) versus the rich people who rule the planet (Stolz et al). And to be honest, I enjoyed it when he spoke with his son about the origin of his name, which was a very well interpreted scene. <br /> <br /> Note for the fans of BSG, the guy who plays 'Willy Adama'. He does not really look much like Olmos, but he's just a boy. Whether or not it will be presented more than it was in this movie, who knows? Surely I could not say it. But it did not bother me, because it was not as interesting as everything that happened around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays "Sister Clarice", and it's creepy and strange in every scene she's in. I am not sure where he will go or who he will end up with, but I was very impressed by his performance. In this film she was a little on the sidelines, but obviously she was prepared to play a very important role later on. She did not look anything like her character in "Rome", something I always find impressive in the actors. <br /> <br /> A nice surprise: music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, although it is the same person who does it. , Bear McCreary. It has a disturbing and unusual approach that took me by surprise, I would buy this score if I had the chance. <br /> <br /> As for the 'panel discussion' after the show, it was organized by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very intelligent and eloquent, David Eick was very intelligent (like his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was chosen, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and did not answer the questions (but I have always had one thing for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she rebuked Seth Green for wrongly telling her he had '24'), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were much loved. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were also there, answering questions about how they did the scenes performing with themselves at BSG. In general, a very interesting and wonderful evening. <br /> <br /> I give the show a 9 out of 10, and I'm anxious to see how everything develops. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I just saw this for the second time and I really hope you will explore what HOLOBAND was originally created for. I have no idea what it can be, but it fascinates me a lot.
