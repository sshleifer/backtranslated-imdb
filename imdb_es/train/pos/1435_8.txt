['I appreciate movies like this: smart and well designed, entertaining, absorbing, well acted and well directed. No one, not even Pacino, is chewing the landscape *, trying to excel; One of the most effective moments of the film (Aielo stopping on his beloved exit ramp) is cooling precisely because of his moderation. <br /><br /> Not as good as, say, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is of a similar fabric: it attracts the mind and the eyes, the ears and the heart. Why so many entertainment failures at the box office is what nobody knows. <br /><br /> * You know, Pacino chews on a particular scene, but precisely because it&#39;s necessary. Great scene, too.']
