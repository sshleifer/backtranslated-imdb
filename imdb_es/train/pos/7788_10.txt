['I love Ashley Judd and I think all her movies are great. Ruby <br /><br /> In Paradise it is one of his best. It is a very discreet film that you really have to see up close to appreciate it. The story of a woman who tries to survive alone and refuses to give in to the temptations that will make her life easier. Some of his films, such as Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill, probably performed better at the box office and video rentals. They were very good movies <br /><br /> also, but take the time to really look at Ruby and I think you&#39;ll agree that she&#39;s one of Ashley&#39;s best. <br /><br />']
