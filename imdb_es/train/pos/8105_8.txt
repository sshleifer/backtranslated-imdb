SYNOPSIS The future seen since 1939 England. When war looms over Europe, the salvation of humanity will not be found in the politics of the past. It is up to the brave new world of science to overcome the past errors of man. <br /> <br /> CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VISOR Take care of your leaders and what they tell you. Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow. There will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope. <br /> <br /> PROS AND CONS I've seen this movie a long time ago and recently downloaded it from the Internet (it's in the public domain). This is a fascinating work on many levels. Since it is a story about the future seen since 1939, it has obvious flaws. This vision of the future is terrifying and capricious. This movie was cutting edge for his day. The special effects are very good as is the story line. The performance suffers a bit in the British theatrical sense, as it may lean a little towards Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems, which we now know is not always true. The other plot of the films is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and probably will always be with us. <br /> <br /> The basics of almost all the subsequent sci-fi movies can be seen in this film. The design of scenery and costumes of "Forbidden Planet", the failures of technology in "2001: A Space Odessy", even the lush landscapes / cityscapes of "Star Wars" must some inspiration to this film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the viewer a bit perplexed. While optimistic in its final sequence of reaching the stars, we wonder if humanity will ever be able to do so. Even when we arrive, there are those who are trying to stop us. This vision of the future of the movies, although interesting, is also a bit humorous by today's standards. In the real world there never materialized huge flying machines and weapons that could shoot people into space, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Many great British actors are in this film as young people. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are evident here. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the main character, Cabel. His character almost appears as the new Christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece of film history whose themes are still relevant today, even if it's Vision of the future lost the brand.
