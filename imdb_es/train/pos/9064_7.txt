I sat with my children while watching this movie. We all find it a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth-grade bully starts with him and this is what leads to eating worms. <br /> <br /> A bet is made and Billy only has a long time to eat 10 worms or otherwise. From this point, the aggressor and his friends try to find unpleasant ways to cook, fry or bake the worms to try to make Billy sick and lose the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy stays strong and eats his way to become an increasingly favorite for everyone, even the stalking friends. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you if you win the bet or not ... you will only need to see it to find out, but I will think that if you like good family movies you will like this one. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this film is not just for children, I have all daughters and they really liked it.
