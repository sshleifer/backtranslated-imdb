This has to be the best adaptation I've seen, it's my favorite and I think it stays very close to the book. What really makes it a must-see is the casting of the two main actors. The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I have seen on the screen something melancholy and tragic, while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and kindness like Jane. The story (as I'm sure most people know) is this, the young and simple Jane Eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800s who advertises her services as a governess in newspapers. He is offered the position of The governess in the great mansion Thornfield Hall will attend Adele, the young ward in the corridors of the mysterious and respected owner, Mr. Rochester. As the months pass, he falls in love with Jane and puts some situations into practice to try to see if Jane is as madly in love with him as he is. However, there is still a secret to discover in Thornfield Hall. and when it is like that, its effects are devastating. This is a moving and well acted drama with good places and beautiful costumes, as I said before, excellent performance, especially Zelah and Timothy.
