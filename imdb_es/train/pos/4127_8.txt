I know there are some purists out there who poop on anything that is not exactly the same as the original, however, sometimes the side effects can be used on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar enough to the Japanese version but at the same time it satisfies the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator, because he explains things with style. The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef who wins them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun cooking, commenting and being eye-catching when creating. I have seen the series and I find that all players work well together. However, judges are not always the best options. There are some exceptions, such as the lawyer who became a food lover, but most judges are questionable for being able to handle what is served. I enjoy watching the bustle of the chefs and the challengers are amazing. The food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. Maybe that's all anyone can ask for, to really want to eat what is served. The only thing that would really change the series is to ask the people of the show to light up a bit. Sometimes, the mood becomes too tense, and that is not always fun to watch when more fun is expected. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was as exaggerated as the original, but I can say it was a very expensive proposal. I wish I had stayed with this version and would have been the host, between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, that would make me smile for an hour. As long as you do not wait for the original Japanese version and can accept this series on its own merits, you may find it a pleasant time.
