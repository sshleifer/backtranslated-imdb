I saw this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved his Oscar. I left the movie thinking yes! Having seen Muni in a single movie in which he was quite crazy, I expected the same kind of acting here. I was happily wrong. Although some might criticize him for being too childish and stereotypically simple in the idea of ​​Hollywood Asians, I thought he was right on paper. Keye Luke, if you had been given the opportunity to play a leading role, could have interpreted it in the same way. <br /> <br /> I was especially impressed with the work with the camera and the use of crowd scenes. especially during the looting of the palace where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphic and somber atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this an epic quite different from others of the same moment when everything was bright and bright. I saw this movie from start to finish enthralled. I can not say the same about the "epics" of today.
