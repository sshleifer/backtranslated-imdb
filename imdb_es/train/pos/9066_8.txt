['~~ I was able to watch this movie yesterday morning on an early viewing pass ~~ <br /><br /> I am a mother of 2 children, ranging from 11 to 6. So I am sure that many parents can relate to having to watch many &quot;children&quot; movies. This was refreshing for me. I have not read this book in particular, so I do not know if he stayed true to the book or not. But surely he took the rudeness factor to a high level. This is the story of the &quot;new&quot; child in the city and it so happens that there is a group of boys who have formed a class club and love to mess with children ... does it sound familiar? We have not all suffered this time or another. He has the little brother he can not stand and the parents he feels embarrassed for. What I liked most was to see how each character was totally different from another, all stood out. The bully (why do they always make the bully a redhead? My daughter has red hair! And she is not a bully! .. hehehe) is a great bully, who finds himself being screamed for his own older brother. It went round and round and you fall in love with all of them and you really find yourself routing all the characters! Even parents, great connection between father and son. All nice, sweet, fun, disgusting, etc ... Take your children! You will enjoy it as much as they do!']
