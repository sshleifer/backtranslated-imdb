Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best black film directors. This is surely your best. <br /> <br /> It does not have some of the standard features of what we now call black cinema. Although made in the United States, it is completely established in England. It does not have gangsters. He lacks a fatal woman. He does not lack crime. <br /> <br /> The title character answers an announcement. She is very happy that she is going to earn some money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes up days later as the pawn in a terrifying plot. Only a very strong person could survive such a frightening and disturbing experience. And Nina Foch gives the feeling of a strong woman like Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the emotion comes from the cast against the guy: Mrs. Foch has an elegant manner. She is not victim screaming, huddled. She is actually a little icy and patrician, although impecuna. This makes the difficult situation of his character even more credible. <br /> <br /> Surely the most fascinating element is the casting of Dame May Witty. She was (and is) probably the most famous for the charming title character in "The Lady Vanishes." She has a sweet manner and a harmless, slightly trembling form. But here she is far from being a heroine. <br /> <br /> George Macready is excellent as his son extremely problematic. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. <br /> <br /> It seems that this famous and brilliant film was made almost by accident. No doubt the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it with a low budget. That is the emotion and the charm of the black cinema, the real black cinema: it is small, convincingly low life and, in this case, unforgettable.
