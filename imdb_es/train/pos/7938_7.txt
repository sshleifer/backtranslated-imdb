Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a lot of kids who do not look like any of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, Rob and Josie get married with a shotgun on a drunken night during a Las Vegas vacation. Each of them comes home and discovers that their respective children already know the nuptials because the tabloids have nothing to do. They, Rob and Josie, move them both and their eight children to one or the other's house. <br /> <br /> I think Rob builds furniture, which is close enough to the construction work of Frank Lambert (Patrick Duffy) in The very similar step by step to justify the eternal mockery. <br /> <br /> Josie is a kind of queen who makes cookies, although she does not seem to make any cookies. Not close enough to Carol Foster's haircut (Suzanne Somers) to justify an imitation image, but hilariously absurd enough to justify a mockery of atrocity. <br /> <br /> Unlike Step by Step, they were a couple before the holidays and they really knew one. the surnames of another person, or that is supposed to be serious enough about a relationship to make a trip together. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I, personally, think they should have called the youngest Andrew 'Andy'. <br /> <br /> There is a large amount of Colocation products, especially for Soup at Hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also some stupid moments, meaningless. It is also not a great movie to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Rob Estes! This concludes my review of 'Step by step ... about some really bad drugs'. Look at it by Rob Estes and his pretty eyes! There are some pretty big eyes!
