['I never realized that Charles Boyer, (Luis Denard) appeared with Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) in a movie together and they enjoyed their great performance together. Even Peter Lorre, (Contreras) had a role in this movie and had a bad disgrace in his bathroom that made him faint. This story is about a Republican messenger, Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great damage to other nations. Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) comes to the aid of Luis Denard to pick him up and at the same time fall in love with him and then helps him escape from an angry mob of English mining workers who threaten his life. The real bad guy in this movie is Victor Francen, (Licata) &quot;Beast with Five Fingers&quot;, which offers an outstanding performance. Great classic film of 1945 without Humphrey Bogart.']
