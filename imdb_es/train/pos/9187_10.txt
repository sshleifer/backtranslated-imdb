['Calling this episode bright feels like very little. To say that it maintains the excellent work of the premiere of the season is also reductive, because until now there has not been an episode of Sopranos far from the great ones. In fact, the title could be a cocky invitation for those who are not real fans yet: Join the Club ... <br /><br /> Returning to where Junior stayed (putting a bullet in the entrails of his nephew after confusing him with a thief he killed in the first season), the story begins with Tony being absolutely fine. Without any memory of what happened to him, he attends some kind of convention. He just is not talking with his normal accent, and it seems that something is wrong with his papers: apparently, it&#39;s not Tony Soprano but Kevin Finnerty, or at least that&#39;s what a group of people thinks, and until the Mess, I can not leave your hotel. <br /><br /> Naturally, in the pure tradition of the Sopranos, that is just a dream: Tony is in a coma, and doctors are not sure of his fate, his family and friends are very sick and Junior refuses to believe that everything happened. Unfortunately, yes, and Anthony Jr. seems willing to avenge the attempt on his father&#39;s life. <br /><br /> The dreams have appeared quite frequently in the series, often as a kind of spiritual test for the protagonists (especially in the program of the fifth season, The Test Dream). Join the Club, however, takes the metaphysical qualities of the program, already suggested by the use of the previous episode of a poem by William S. Burroughs, and pushes the envelope in the most audacious way: Tony hallucinates about his dead friends (the first Event of the kind was caused by food poisoning, four seasons ago) is one thing, actually, being in what seems to be Purgatory is radically different. The &quot;heavenly&quot; section of the story is filled with allegorical meanings, including the name given to Tony (as a character points out, spelling it in some way will give him the word &quot;infinite&quot;), and none of them appears. so exaggerated or outlandish: David Chase has created a work that is too smart to use strange configurations just for its own sake; Everything helps the narrative. However, talking about &quot;help from above&quot; in the case of Tony Soprano could be spreading it a bit.']
