['First I bought this movie on VHS from which I had to buy it on a DVD, it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I have read the book, but I really believe that the movie is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam since Mr. Knightley was an excellent choice. It was brilliant! <br /><br /> It&#39;s a 10/10 movie! <br /><br />']
