I have never understood why the swan song MacDonald-Eddy has always been criticized so ruthlessly, not only by its detractors but by practically everyone. For me, "I married an angel" is more animated and imaginative than any of the duo's most famous outings. The sets and the costumes are as luxurious as those found in an MGM musical, the script is by the reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "The Women", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", etc.), Rodgers and Hart Herbert Stothart (winner of the Oscar for the score of "The Wizard of Oz") gives a celestial treatment to the melodies (although the alterations of MacDonald-Eddy and Chet Forrest) give him a celestial treatment, and the best of everything is that the "singing couple" look very well in their contemporary clothes and seem to have fun with the extravagant procedures. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" to the uninitiated today, and you may find it difficult to sit still, but this extravagant, fast-paced fantasy is meant to entertain.
