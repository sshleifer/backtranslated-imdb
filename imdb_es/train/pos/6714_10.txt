Why did I enjoy the show until the last episode? Due to the real talent that Melissa Joan Hart and her cast had to show that the whit, the comedy, the cheerful humor and the deep thought could really coexist. What I enjoyed most was the fact that I was able to return home after a hard day of work and to smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to see how this magical person was so happy while helping others. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Sabrina was a heroine ... although she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from ours ... to very different; I had powers within reach, desires and orders that could be used for good or for bad, that can only exist in many of our imaginations. Almost everything we see, have, know, possess or even want ... can be used for good or bad, and how we choose to define that, defines the person we are. <br /> <br /> Traveled the world and other realms with these constant and unwavering ideas in mind ... learn, live, laugh and love. He was always learning how to improve his skills for the benefit of everyone around him; she made mistakes while living life, going through different growth journeys, since she, her aunts and Salem (the undervalued but imperfect hero) did well to show that even through mistakes, she can still be noble, gifted and wonderful. <br /> <br /> He also demonstrated many selfless, loving and learning acts along his way. If this is not enough reason for 10 stars in this world torn by war where people are so hostile to each other, without realizing how differences are the salt of life instead of a reason to kill ... then no I know what it is. . This show was undoubtedly a trip to a better world, as well as an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift meant to provoke a smile in our chops ... I heard from a doctor before everything I mentioned above. leads to a healthy "deer" ... and is not that what we all need? :)
