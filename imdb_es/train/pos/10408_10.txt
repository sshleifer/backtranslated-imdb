['The first time I saw this movie was when I was a child and I fell in love with it immediately. The sets are impressive and some of the scripts are very funny: &quot;Children of a thousand fleas&quot;. <br /><br /> It is always shown on television late at night or very early in the morning, I woke up at 3:00 am once and had just started. Television companies must show a little more respect and put it on primetime on Sunday so everyone can have the opportunity to see this excellent work. <br /><br /> 10/10']
