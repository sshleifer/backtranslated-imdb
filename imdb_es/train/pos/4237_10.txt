Charleton Heston used one, James Franciscus used one, but Mark Wahlberg chooses not to wear the traditional canvas. I hope no one will cast him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet movies, but Star Warren barely shows cleavage, her hair is always on the way. Tim Burton could have sexed this saga of apes and gave the adults in the audience something to do. Even the caste Helena Bonham Carter never takes off the disguise, which looks like a great curtain. She is beautiful, but everything related to love is restricted to anxious looks and a small kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence, which analyzes the sex between species between robots and humans, but never delivers, Planet of the Apes hints at the interspecies romance between humans and apes, but only insinuates. Lisa Marie is the only monkey that dares to be sexy. This movie features three great actors, Tim Roth, Mrs. Carter and Paul Giamatti, who eat like a trio of monkeys and are fun to watch. Costumes, ensembles and superlative makeup music (a certain Oscar) make this the successful summer film of 2001.
