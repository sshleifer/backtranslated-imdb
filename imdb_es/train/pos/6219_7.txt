['What an entertaining movie Astaire and Randolph Scott are in the Navy. Astaire has to court Ginger in San Francisco, while Scott must be persuaded that Harriet Hilliard is worthy to be his wife. Everything works well. <br /><br /> Sometimes it is discussed, and I can see why, Scott&#39;s romance with Hilliard is unnecessary and slows down the plot. Especially painful are Hilliard&#39;s singing love songs. I could have done it without her singing, enough, but the romance seemed quite moving. Hilliard enters the film as a music teacher, with a pair of glasses, without makeup and the ugliest clothes a man or beast knows. It is no wonder that Scott avoids it until he is sexually groomed under the tutelage of his sister Ginger and the furtive Lucille Ball. The problem is that AFTER her makeover, she looks like the same woman irremediably simple as before, only with a brighter outfit. It&#39;s hard enough for a homeboy. But at least one man can become rich, powerful and popular, then he can gather women anyway, even if he looks like JoJo, the dog-faced boy. But what does a simple-looking woman do? The same avenues for romance are not open to her. Henry Kissinger had groupies. Margaret Thatcher? It must be terrible to be a common woman in a culture as cruel as ours. As a kind of footnote, I should mention that it was rumored that Randolph Scott was bisexual because of the Hollywood gossip that needed nonsense, and it&#39;s kind of funny that he has the next line in this movie when he&#39;s discouraging Hilliard: - &quot;The Women do not interest me, sister. &quot; The movie will probably give Ginger Rogers more quality time than any of his other films with Astaire. And she is wonderful. She is beautiful, sexy, a talented actress and dancer, and the script also gives her good comic lines. &quot;We&#39;re going to kiss and make up,&quot; suggests Astaire. &quot;We&#39;re going to make up,&quot; she says, &quot;that will give you something to work on.&quot; It is also the only movie he made with Astaire that gives him a solo number during an audition. (Choreographed by Hermes Pan.) His performance is accidentally sabotaged by Astaire, who slides a bit of Alka Seltzer or something in his water, and hiccups through his number, since the eructation is too delicate at the moment. <br /><br /> As a dancer, it would be an excellent circus elephant, so my opinion should be taken as that of an amateur, but I think their dances together are the same as those they shoot. The first, during a dance contest, &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot;, is the most exuberant of all that I can remember. And the only dramatic duo, &quot;Let&#39;s face music and dance,&quot; must be among its best. The last step when leaving is surprising. <br /><br /> I like the movie for reasons with personal resonance. I remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown San Diego, next to a store called &quot;The Seven Seas&quot; that supplied boaters. I was in uniform at that time and I was impressed with the treatment of the naval races of Astaire and Scott. What I want to say is that here we have this frothy musical comedy that owes absolutely nothing to historical reality and yet, unlike most of its other teamings, it pays its dues anyway. When jumping from the boat, Astaire asks for a &quot;water taxi&quot;. He had just taken a water taxi on land. The uniforms are correct for the period (unlike, for example, those in &quot;In the city&quot;). And they are worn appropriately, hats up to two fingers wide above the eyebrow and not backwards. And there are two incidents in which Astaire encounters a problem with the naval authorities and both are handled with perfect seriousness and are completely credible. An officer prevents Astaire from leading a jazz band during the inspection and informs the captain: &quot;They were playing when the call rang, sir, I&#39;m sure it was not intended to violate the discipline.&quot; It&#39;s what an officer would say, a good officer, and nobody laughs. <br /><br /> The series was becoming a bit repetitive when &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; was made, so instead of putting Fred in high society and a tuxedo, they turned him into a swabbie who chewed gum. It was a good idea. And the dance numbers are up to the concept.']
