['What another reviewer called lack of character development, I call underestimation. The film did not hit one in the head with an overexplication or an unnecessary background story. Yes, there were many untold stories that we could only glimpse, but this was mainly a snapshot of a day in an event that catalyzed the change in the lives of all the characters. The performance of Henry Thomas was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction instead of action. Good rent']
