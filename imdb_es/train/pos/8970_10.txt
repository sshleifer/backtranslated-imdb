I researched this movie a bit and discovered a website that claims that it was actually an inside joke about the world of gays and lesbians from World War II in Greenwich Village. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, sorcerers and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the play, was apparently gay and was very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was ironic because I saw Bell, Book and Candle for the first time in the theater when I was in fifth or sixth grade just because my parents accepted me. It was hard to take me to a movie that did not include horses, machine guns or alien monsters and I planned to get bored. But I remember the moment Jimmy Stewart hugged Kim Novak at the top of the Flatiron building and took off his hat as the camera followed him to the floor. When the glorious theme of George Duning's love soared, I suddenly had an idea of ​​how it felt to fall in love. The first movements of romantic / sexual love left me stunned when I left the theater. I am sure that I am not the only preadolescent child who was seduced by Kim Novak's surprising and direct look. It is ironic that a gay parable has been able to boost heterosexual puberty in many of us. I am in my last 50 years and I went back to see the movie last night and those same feelings were shaken when I saw that the hat was played down fifty years later. . .
