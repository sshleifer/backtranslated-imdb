The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, which I'm in love with since the ninth grade, which was his first year at SNL. I am a fan of the Yankees and I did not find the film painful until the last 15 minutes, when they begin to show the clips of the ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small noises so as not to have to listen to what should not be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable. <br /> <br /> I thought Jimmy played the role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and peculiar, and he is a nervous and peculiar guy. I know it may not be an Academy Award-winning stretch, but the film is just a light and fun romantic comedy that is really appropriate for both women and men to see. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry in the camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him, and thank God, because Taxi could have killed him. I think Fever Pitch will help you a lot. Everyone should stop being so critical of their ability to act because he is just beginning in the movies. I imagine it must be difficult, and if you look at one of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.) you will see that they started with some failures. Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? Here I wish Jimmy a successful career on the screen. I never wanted him to leave the SNL, but what can you do?
