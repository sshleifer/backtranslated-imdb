The book on which this film is based was excellent; It took a while to accept the unconventional style of Houellebecq, but once I understood the state of mind behind the writing, I felt completely attracted to the author's world of sadness. In fact, no other book has affected me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing; He elucidated my own personal struggle and made the futility of my own struggle more difficult to accept. Houellebecq's ideas are masterfully captured by Harel and the hero's apathy and indifference for a world that has rejected him is perfectly portrayed. This is a film that reveals the current society for the humble man in all his horror. Hopefully, things will change in the future, but for the moment we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie. It is probably better that Harel or Houellebecq not create a work of genius like this again. One is enough for any man.
