['Thre is not a single Scorsese movie that I would list for my favorite movies. But this is the best thing I&#39;ve run through my DVD player in about five years. The patient elucidation of the favorite moments of the Scorsese film and how Hollywood works is incredibly kind, serene and intelligent. <br /><br /> It is the 3-sided value of DVD material. It would have to be a British production, since everything related to the American corporate culture would have trampled on the silent, methodical, simple and focused approach to the content adopted here. And a US production would have required him to say that he liked only the movies that were favorites. I want everyone to take a page of their love for movies. You should love the movies you make for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not only more &quot;me too&quot; votes for The Godfather, etc. People have no idea what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. If they did, the movies would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese knows what ideas are being explored, and that makes him a compelling speaker involved in the subject. I really appreciate your articulated and generous interviews over the last decade. <br /><br /> On a negative note, Scorsese is better when he&#39;s excited to show you a dark movie, rather than when he&#39;s teaching you something well-established about film history. And I would like him to pull those three hairs off the bridge of his nose. Is very annoying.']
