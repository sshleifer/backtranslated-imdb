This is a movie that everyone should see. Apart from raising very important points (while South Africa is on the road to recovery, there are still many countries in similar situations now), it is very well run, while Denzel Washington offers, in my opinion, the best performance in his career up to the moment. Kline also offers good performance, although it may not be as impressive as Washington's. John Thaw also plays a good role as chief of police. <br /> <br /> There are many possible areas where a film about apartheid could fall, but all these have been avoided. It would be easy to portray whites as bad guys and blacks as good guys, but Attenborough has not. Sure, there were some white characters who looked intrinsically evil, like the Captain in the Soweto uprising, but adding extra dimensions to all the characters would make the movie unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the movie as it is, but I think it takes two and a half hours to tell the whole story, because it's really amazing. <br /> <br /> The best scene In the movie is the one of the funeral of Steve Biko. When the whole crowd starts singing the South African national anthem, it's probably one of the most moving scenes I've seen, if you have not seen it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, look at it. It may not be comfortable to watch, but it's certainly worth it.
