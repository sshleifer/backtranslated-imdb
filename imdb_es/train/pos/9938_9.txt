['We bought the DVD set of &quot;Es war einmal das Leben&quot; (German) / &quot;Once Upon a Time ... Life&quot; (English) for our bilingual children because they all loved &quot;Es war einmal der Mensch&quot; (German) / &quot;Once Upon a Time ... Man&quot; (in English) (we, the parents had seen it since childhood) and has exceeded even the highest expectations! The series is very well done, it does not show its age, and our children of various ages like it a lot. At the same time, they learn things that parents did not know until much, much later. The series covers everything related to the human body from the organs, all the senses, blood, infections, antibodies and much more in animated episodes of 20 to 25 minutes. The subjects that some people may find &quot;sensitive&quot;, such as digestion and reproduction, are treated in an elegant, discreet and friendly way for children (the reproduction episode begins coverage mainly where the baby begins to grow), while continuing being (as typical) informative and fun. <br /><br /> Children are often fascinated with the way their bodies work and, through the episodes, gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment. The format of the episodes changes between the outside world (a family with 2 children) and the inside of the body. For example, in the episode that covers infections, the child is cut accidentally and the wound becomes infected and the episode explains how the body reacts to this. In a similar way, episodes in the senses, for example, listening, seeing, linking what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode about breathing and the circulation of oxygen in the blood cover the whole life cycle, included (briefly) the place where the oxygen arrives. of plants). <br /><br /> This is one of the best programs for children of all time. I would say it is a must for all families with children!']
