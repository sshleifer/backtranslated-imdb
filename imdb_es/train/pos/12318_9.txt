['Although I&#39;m not the biggest fan of martial arts movies based on wire work, when a movie goes directly to the fantasy instead of fighting, I have a lot more fun and this movie is one of the best in terms of fantastic conspiracy and crazy flight. tricks. Ching Siu Tung has created a charming treatment here with excellent performance and a lot of ethereal beauty. The great and tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax-collecting hero who spends the night in an enchanted temple and gets involved with an awesome fox spirit and a crazy Taoist. Cheungs&#39;s performance is full of a naive but dignified charm, and Wu Ma is pleasantly out of place as the Taoist monk, who shows some swordplay and even gets a musical number. Perhaps the best of all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, a true pleasure to contemplate with each movement and each captivatingly seductive gesture. The film includes elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all mixed in a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, the direction and handling of the choreography gives a bit of emotion to the work, and fills the film with mists, shades and colors of carefreely disturbing forests, giving each scene of the forest a wonderfully captivating atmosphere. Also noteworthy are the elaborate hairstyles and the beautiful loose garments of the female characters, with, if I am not mistaken, Joey Wang wearing the hair made as fox ears at times, a wonderful touch. Although the film has relatively little action and some corny pop songs are misguided at times, this is a beautiful piece of entertainment, with characters and plots, including the strange arc of characters, an almost constant supply of visual delights and a copious dream atmosphere. . An ethereal treasure, highly recommended.']
