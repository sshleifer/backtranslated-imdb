['Gundam Wing is a funny show. I appreciate it for getting into Gundam and anime in general. However, after seeing their predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and even G Gundam, I find that Wing is Gundam Lite. <br /><br /> Characters: One aspect that Gundam has sustained for a long time is to make his characters look difficult and grow in maturity. This does not happen in the wing. Heero is the best dog at the beginning, and is the best dog at the end. Personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is, for all intents and purposes, a hero in most of the series. But suddenly, the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason. <br /><br /> Mecha: Wing has great costume designs. The Gundams are super cool, with the Epyon being my favorite. I even think that some of the OZ suit designs are on par with some of Zeon&#39;s classic suits. But the designs of sweet suits do not save the series of boring characters. <br /><br /> Conclusion: In the end, Wing has great fight scenes, although they are full of recycled animations, but with a shallow plot and a character development. Nice, but it does not move like previous Gundam exits.']
