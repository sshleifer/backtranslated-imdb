If you like Star Wars / Trek, come and see where they got all their ideas and cinematographic devices. It's my 2 favorite movies of all time, from another world, futuristic and psychological suspense. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "The Tempest") is not overshadowed by the contraptions of whizbang (later Lucas). And just because it was done in 1956, do not assume you can "see the ropes" holding the flying saucer. This was the first movie you could not. Miracle was made to scale of "A-movie", the economy and the tastes at that time were accumulated to a large extent against him. And the previous 'success' of director Wilcox was "Lassie Come Home". Until I looked for it, I assumed that 'Fred Wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was or later became famous, but at that time he did not want to associate with science fiction, which was strictly a "B" genre. at that time. This was a VERY visionary production, or a very accidental "mistake" on the part of the people who financed Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are large-scale mates with live action almost microscopically inserted that Lucas used extensively. There are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotyped 'user interface'; The "computers", since they have been portrayed much less futuristically in later works. The "transporter" of Star Trek is there, visually, almost unaltered by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the Trek / Wars technology turns it off, the scientific references of FP are not exaggerated and they are all accurate, even today. The set "ship" is complete, bright and realistic, as good as anything you've seen since then, and more convincing than anything Trek has done, for television or movies. We could not spend as much time there as I would have liked. <br /> <br /> If you have ever wondered how movies came to space so competently, see FP will explain all that. It's definitely not 'Wagontrain to the Stars'.
