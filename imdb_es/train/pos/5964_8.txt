Being a fan of genre films, a child of the 80s and a fan of hard rock music ... this film has a special place in my heart. It has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a glam-rock soundtrack of guitar laments. It was certainly THE movie for all the heavy metal fans at that time. I did not see this in the cinema because it was never released here theatrically ... but its popularity in the video from the mid-to-late eighties ensured its cult status and eventually led to a (unfortunately, mediocre) release of DVD in 2002. Yes you're not a fan of spooky movies or rock music, so this probably is not your cup of tea ... but, trust me, there are worse movies of this kind ... and, despite the average performance and some Ridiculously ridiculous situations, Trick or Treat is definitely a riff of regrets above the usual horror rate. You will never look at your stereo the same way again. Or should I say MP3 player? <br /> <br /> TRIVIA TRICK OR TREATMENT: Marc Price (Eddie) played the geek Skippy Handelman in the popular long-running comedy "Family Ties". After a series of direct flops to video, among them, 'Little Devils' 'Killer Tomatoes eats France' and 'The Rescue', he gave up acting to pursue a career in comedy. Recently, he has been considering a return to television. <br /> <br /> Glen Morgan (Roger) is now a major Hollywood producer / screenwriter. He has written and produced several major movies and television series, including: 'Space: Above and Beyond' 'The X-Files'' Final Destination '' The One '' Will '' by J. J. and more recently 'Final Destination 3'. <br /> <br /> Tony Fields (Sammi) began his career as a dancer in the TV series 'Solid Gold'. He appeared in several films and low-budget television programs before playing his role as the diabolical Sammi Curr in 'Trick or Treat'. Regrettably, Tony died on February 27, 1995 of an AIDS-related cancer. <br /> <br /> Doug Savant (Tim) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of twenty-somethings Matt Fielding in the popular sitcom 'Melrose Place'. Since then, he has had a long and varied career as an actor, appearing in films and television series such as: 'The One' 'Godzilla' 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' and the short science fiction series Joss Whedon 'Firefly'. He can currently be seen as Tom Scavo in the hit series 'Desperate Housewives'.
