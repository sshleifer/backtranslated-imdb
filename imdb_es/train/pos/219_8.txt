Simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the crunch of the script. There are few films that can develop a relationship of this kind between the actors and the script. For example, the famous scene of the meeting could have been much more boring with actors of lower quality involved. Matthau seems to have been born to play Willie Clark (of course, Oscar Moreso in Odd Couple), and with all the little idiosyncrasies and gestures Matthau puts into the character (the line in which he argues that he is with him ever since). He lives in the city, while Lewis lives in the country, since Lewis is "out of touch" is the quintessential example of this. It makes this one of the best performances I've seen of any actor on any role, be it comedic or dramatic. or any other thing. Period. Matthau and Burns work excellently together; the contrast they represent accentuates Simon's extraordinary ability to create a comical conflict. This film is simply one of the last "must see" and demands a legitimate and legitimate place in the pages of film history.
