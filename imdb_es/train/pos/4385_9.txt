What can be said about a movie that has one of the blackest, most nihilistic and, at times, the strangest villains? I will not say "nice". I will say "charismatic" villains in the history of cinema and the best sword fight ever since. Flynn and Fairbanks were at their peak? This is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes stupid, incredibly brave and honest man who fights for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very touching, tender and sensual.
