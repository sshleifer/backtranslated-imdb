This dramatic documentary is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": beautifully photographed, convincingly locked, well written in the correct and literate way that Hollywood discarded in the 1930s, and scrupulously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, excelling in its interpretation of the Native American culture (or, more appropriately by its Canadian setting, "First Nations") and standing out with "Black Robe" as a wonderfully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture (here, around the year 1934). This idyllic portrait derives the drama of its theme: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a Scotch raised in Hastings (England) by unmarried aunts who became so obsessed with the "red Indian" tales of his childhood that he went to Canada, they disappeared in the Woods, and became a trapper and adopted son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man in the habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides, none of whom seems to have paid less attention to him, since he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character. One of his wives (one more intelligent than he, according to most accounts) impelled him to fame as a writer and early advocate of the protection of the wild country of the North, and this is the focus of Attenborough's account. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as the wife of Gray Owl, Pony) is attractive and, if it is not Firey, it is quite moving. A good movie when you need some time from the crazy crowd.
