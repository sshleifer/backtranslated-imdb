I totally agree with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most surprising and informative that I have seen in my life. As I said before, I remember that I started to look, thinking that it was just another study of nature: interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only was the history of the colony amazing, but I remember that music was part of its appeal. If I remember correctly, it was the pipes of Native Americn (similar to the music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). I have also been looking for a copy. This should be necessary while watching anyone, but especially the schools. It should be relaunched.
