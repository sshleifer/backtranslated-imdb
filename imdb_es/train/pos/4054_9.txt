The first time I saw this movie was in the 1980s as a little boy. My dad really recorded it from the television. I must have seen more than 20 times, before the relatively recent release on DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course I bought and saw the DVD and I was surprised at how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. However, the new version, with Van Der Beek et al, is more comical. <br /> <br /> In other words, it's like watching the original release of Akira in the US. UU With that dubbing, before seeing the remastered version with literal translation of the Japanese. <br /> <br /> In no way am I complaining, the story and the quality of the animation are not harmed, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki was destined for a clearer or darker narrative. theme in his movie .....
