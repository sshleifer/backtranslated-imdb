The boys work outside of a recording studio when they hear "the voice of an angel". That would be Miss Van Doren, auditioning and under the name of Miss Andrews because her father does not approve of her being a "radio singer". However, she hopes that a certain big wig, Mrs. Bixby, a friend of her dad's will hire her, and then he will have to give her approval. <br /> <br /> She leaves but in a few minutes the boys are running. Imbecil in the studio causing havoc and causing other musicians to kill them after ruining the recording session. Finally, things calm down. "By the way, we elude them," says Moe. "Yes, we also escaped," answers Curly. <br /> <br /> The boys are entertained in the studio, they put Miss Van Doren's record and Curly dresses in women's clothes and pretends she's singing. Mrs. Bixby enters, is impressed and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" in the place. For an additional $ 500, she asks him to come and sing at his high society party that night. The rest, as they say, is history, since Curly pretends to be an opera singer with some fun results. Oh, by the way, he was accompanied by "Senior Much" and "Senior Gusto". <br /> <br /> What happens at the party is simply that the truth expires, but not before a few mischiefs occur. In all, a pretty good episode. I enjoyed it but I would not rate it as something special.
