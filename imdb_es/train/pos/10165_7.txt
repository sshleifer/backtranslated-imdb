Actually my vote is a 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it has those funny parts that make it worth watching, do not get me wrong, it's not the funniest movie in the world and it's not even original because it's an idea we've seen before in Other movies, but it's He has his own taste, a friend of mine told me it was a movie for boyfriends ... I think not exactly but who cares. There's also another movie that shows us almost the same theme, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that's a very funny movie, see both if you want and I know you'll agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie. I would like the male character to be given to Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is good.
