There are some comments about this film that say it is bad and silly and that an actor as excellent as Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted acting in it. <br /> <br /> I think, quite the opposite, that even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses, the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so formidable that it makes the film excellent. <br /> <br /> Its performance is probably the best ever. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very controversial scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret. <br /> <br /> For someone who does not believe a priest? even a defrocked ?? It can turn it into the blood of Christ, the scene is perhaps strange. But for someone who has been educated in a Catholic setting, it is very emotional, although it is quite unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The scene of the death of the youngest priest is tremendously shocking. But it is very well acted. Pierre Fresnay turns the crazy act of murder into something understandable within the temporary madness of his character, the tortured and defeated Morand who, in this terrible way, returns to his duty.
