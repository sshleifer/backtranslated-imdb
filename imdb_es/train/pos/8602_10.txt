One used to say, with respect to Nathaniel Hawthorne, that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I think the same comment could fit the photos of McDonald-Eddy. And especially this one. <br /> <br /> Apparently it has many characteristics of a failed film: it is kitsch, the script, due to censorship, does it sound inconsistent? However, this film also has some good points: good music by Rodgers-Hart ("I married an angel", "Strip strip pulls"), good acting with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you do not like it, you can not forget it. This strange movie actually leaves a very strong, dreamy impression, and it is very likely that you keep it in mind for days, maybe for weeks. Why? In the thirties and early forties, movies did not have the same meaning as they do today: they pretended, like a dream, to divert the audience to make them forget a difficult reality. Of all the dream movies that were made, at that time, this one is particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> In summary, let's say that the best way to appreciate this movie is to see it without wondering. if it's good or bad To see it, as if you were going to see a dream.
