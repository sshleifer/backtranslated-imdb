For all the critics on this page, I must say that this movie is worth seeing. This was done in 1972, and what. The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time. People who did not study the culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series, 'Left Behind' (which is made for our time right now) looks cheerful. However, the only important part of the film is fashion, which was again more than 30 years ago. BUT. The message that is sent in this movie is very powerful and is carefully preserved. There is so much to say, but I refuse to say it. (for fear of spoiling it) So go see this movie! If you do not like the message you send, then you have problems, you need attention!
