witty. funny. smart. amazing. I was changing channels late one night years ago. I found this and started a forest fire. I stayed up late every night and recorded for everyone I know. a few. As 3 people out of the almost 100 people I did see this I did not think it was as amazing as I did. the others were laughing so hard that they cried and thanked me at the same time. please do yourself a favor run no andes Look at this and enjoy. Intelligence and humor It is a win-win situation. I wish I could have afternoon tea with him and meet the really weird comedian that we, as a society, need more ... sanechaos.
