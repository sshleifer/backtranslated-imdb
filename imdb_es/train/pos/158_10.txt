I have seen this movie more than once, and there is always someone who complains about the "obvious construction" of the plot afterwards. But then, this is part of Petzold's game: play with the rules of the genre. <br /> <br /> It's very nice, how is the highly unlikely story of how the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) meet. reflected in another story, even more improbable, that the girls compensate for a casting. This film is a journey between reality and fiction, it is more about potentials, things that could have happened in the past or that could be happening in the future, than about real events. It is a kind of reverie, so, for what there are many reasons, Freud could have found interesting for the analysis of his dreams, as all the denominations "doppelganger". <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I think that "Gespenster" could be interesting to be seen compared to the current Asian cinema of the strange: Petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels harassed in a discreet and strangely familiar way. This movie is not about the obvious. To describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphan mother, who seeks out her lost daughter in Europe, clearly says nothing about the nature of "Gespenster." .
