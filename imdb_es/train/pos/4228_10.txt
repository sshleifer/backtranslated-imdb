A first-class Columbo from start to finish. I particularly like the interaction between Columbo and the murderer, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As a Columbo fan, I can not remember another one in which he does not set the killer at the end, since he does it in other episodes. In this, while trying to determine the correct sequence of boxes and the "message" that the nephew left, it finally occurs to him. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is also very good. , as it is in many others.
