Reflections: pure delight from beginning to end. It is not a riot of laughter, but a more subtle and sophisticated humor. What a gold mine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr. .. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant is in sight of his new home, which It is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by the future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "fools to be rabbits", or something that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, answers affirmatively. At that moment, Barker yells at his teammates, "OK, guys, he wants rabbits, so ... YANK 'EM OUT!" A second later, you hear the sound of rips and tears of about 20 large nails that are removed from several tables. All Grant can do is moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is dated. You would never see so many carpenters working in a single-family house at the same time, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably cost a few million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic movie that is really a treasure.
