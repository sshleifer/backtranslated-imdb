A classy movie shot in 2 directions. For your benefit, it is directed by Wes Craven. On the downside, the budget of the television movie shows what could have been much more with a bigger budget. He moves while Susan Lucci draws Robert Urichfamily to his clutches and tries to convince him of the secret of his health club. His latest invention, a space suit that can analyze people or things, becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighborhood. Anyone who sees this should pay attention to Susan Lucci. Its appearance and performance had an unexpected impact a few years later. The actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this movie. Lucci became the subject of a portrait that he himself followed as the basis for the works of a nanny named Catherine. The portrait of Lucci and Barbara Steele in 'Black Sunday' was used as a reference for Catherine's portraits that were immediately removed by Armourae. Probably due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine. Then, by watching both films, we can get an idea of ​​another story and the appearance of an unknown woman who would make an interesting film.
