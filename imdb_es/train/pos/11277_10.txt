Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men come to look for ivory and take Jane to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to get her back ... even if that means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> This is a rarity, a sequel that is better than the original. "Tarzan, the monkey man" of 1932 was good, but it had some terrible special effects and something dragged. This one has many better effects and is much more adult. There are tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot blank, and nobody cares) but this was in 1934. There is also a lot of blood, blood and violence (for a 1934 film) and uncut prints that Jane is doing. A long swim under the water totally naked! There is also obvious sexual content, and Tarzan and Jane are almost without clothes and (implicitly) they sleep together and have sex, without being married. This would not bother anyone today, but in 1934 it was quite extreme. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film is well directed, it is very fast and it is full of adventures and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in that sparse lion's cloth is certainly a pleasure for the eyes and Jane's attire is also quite revealing. I still think that Maureen O'Sullivan is bad like Jane, but Weismuller is perfect like Tarzan. Everyone else is fine. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best Weismuller: O'Hara Tarzan out there. Well worth seeing, but not for children!
