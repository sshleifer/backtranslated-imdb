I saw this movie the first time while drunk in a motel in Canada. While browsing the channels I found the Easy Lube part. My friend kept turning, but I told him to come back. Something about the name easy lubricant just did not sound good. He saw the rest of the movie that was very funny. He wrote down a couple of names of the credits and came home to look for it. It turned out to be the first Chevy Chase movie. I did not remember him. I did not remember much about it, so I rented it and gave it a second visit. It's pretty funny and pretty graphic. It's like Kentucky Fried Movie, except it's not so fun. I love the fingers, the easy lubricant, and I'm in charge of the president. The representation of the distributors is very good too. I give it a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
