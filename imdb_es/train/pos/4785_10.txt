[No Spoilers] <br /> <br /> Being a David Lynch movie, one might have the idea that it represents that enigmatic mind like most of his films. But it is a very direct story as the title might suggest. No, except getting stuck in the usual Lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after seeing it, for example, Lost Highway. It's a simple movie but in fact it's a great movie. That is both from an innovative and entertaining aspect. It's innovative because Lynch is not. But maybe that's Lynch. He likes to twist our minds and, therefore, prepares a film that might seem very conventional and far from Lynch himself. Being a very avant-garde director, he could make a movie like this one just to annoy his regular audience because he knows what they expect but does not give it to him. That would be clever. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is slow. I would almost say the speed of the lawnmower ... Do not expect an orgy of action, but the film is really entertaining for those who go with the flow of the movie. Look carefully for those little details that Lynch traces throughout the film for our entertainment. Look for the great cinematography that makes this movie come alive. And listen to the Badalamenti score and the main theme that really animates the landscapes of Iowa and Wisconsin that are shown frequently. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth presents one of his best performances in this film, which makes him one of the nicest men in the movie. You do not have to say anything to express your feelings and thoughts. His joy only shines through him and his performance earned him an Oscar nomination. Need I say that your weak health in this movie was not acted? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot right after the movie was completed. That knowledge only puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All of the above forms a very good moving image that is suitable for all kinds of people who like a movie the way they are supposed to. One could ask for homilies that are not so obvious and a little naive, but they do not ruin the big picture, since it is a memorable film. 9/10.
