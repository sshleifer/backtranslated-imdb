['Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a movie for long-term Internet fans, made completely for the love of the series, and a must-see for Trek fans. The production quality is extremely high for a fan movie, although sometimes it can be said that they are on green screen. However, this does not take away from the experience in general. The CGI ships are fantastic, as are the scenes of space battles ... On the negative side, I could see in the previous episodes (and even occasionally in the newer ones) that some of the actors / actresses do not feel very comfortable in their roles, but once again, this does not take away the general experience of the new interpretations of Star Trek. The cast and crew have really created something special here, and, in general, I would recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.']
