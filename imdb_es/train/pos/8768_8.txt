I saw this movie in a store in the cheap section. In fact, I vividly remembered seeing the commercials and the trailer years ago. I thought about "What the hey 'and I bought it, basically because the plot sounded interesting and Claire Danes has always been a person of talent in my eyes (this was also before I became a big Kate Beckinsale fan). /> <br /> Then, it's about two girls who escape on vacation to Bangkok, are arrested for narcotics (of which they are innocent) and then are sent to a prison in Thailand.The film follows what will happen to them and , sometimes, questions their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale provide excellent performances, and the plot of this film is concluded in an unconventional way, and raises some questions of good moral discussion. <br> /> <br /> I think this is a good solid film, but there could have been some improvements, it could have been longer ... it would have helped to consolidate these characters and a greater understanding of the justice system policy of Thailand would have help do. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that, it's a good movie with some great performances. <br /> <br /> PS For All of you, addicted to pop culture, watch for a two minute paper by Paul Walker. I did not even notice it the first time I saw the movie.
