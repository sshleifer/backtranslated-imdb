In 1955, the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall. To this day, it is one of the best examples of British comedy and, more particularly, about how television comedies become so popular. It was, and is, an excellent example also of the self-referential cinema. <br /> <br /> So also Soapdish, a film I had never heard of until a few nights ago, when I saw it on late television. At first I hesitated a bit simply because comedy is so hard to do well, as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised and I loved watching a very smart satire on American television during the day. In fact, it's been a while since I've laughed so much. So, if you like satire, I recommend you see it. <br /> <br /> The main actors? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty? Just do an excellent job, revealing how perverted and superficial is the task of acting. As I watched him, he kept thinking: what part of this laziness moves to real life? That is, if the actors ever have a real life? As you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, was famous for hiding his real person behind a multitude of characters, so that no one really knew the real person. Then, while watching Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot playing Maggie, I thought back to that previous British movie with Kay Kendall playing Laura playing a character in a television comedy with Peter Finch ... <br /> < I ask that some actors have nervous breakdowns? And that feeling crystallized when Celeste finally confronts her daughter (Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue) and, in an emotional moment, repeats the fictional lines she had used, in a previous episode of her soap opera during the day, when she confronted his fictional daughter in that's how! You're confused? Well, not everything is like that, but the dialogue is surprising in terms of originality, comedy, malice, anger, depravity, duplicity and even ... love. <br /> <br /> The story? Well, there are many stories in this movie, all interwoven, and they all come together at the end (of course, but not like a Robert Altman movie, okay!), And not all of them are finally resolved. Life is not like that anyway, right? The rhythm is almost frantic, and you really have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the looks and subtle jokes. Spend the 97 minutes of your life and look at it; You will not regret the use of time. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast performed well, although I've never taken Whoopi Goldberg much. Perhaps the funniest exchanges are between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and, for my money, the latter steals so many scenes from others, I get my vote as the most outstanding player. I'm not kidding, she gives the term bitch a completely new face ...
