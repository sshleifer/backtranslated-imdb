['An unusual film by Ringo Lam and one that is strangely underestimated. The mixture of kung fu fantasy with a more realistic representation of swords and spears driven through bodies is surprising, especially during the first ten minutes. A rider cuts himself in two and his waist and legs are still riding the horse. Several horses are stung. It is very unexpected. <br /><br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a maniac crazed and imprisoned in the temple of the Red Lotus, which seems to be more a torture chamber than a temple. The general has a similarity with Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, since he emits a distorted philosophy and makes terrifying paintings with human blood. <br /><br /> The production is very impressive and the scenery is bleak. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and, for the most part, consistent, unlike many Hong Kong action scenes of the time. Sometimes the movie becomes absurd or the effects are corny, but it&#39;s never bad enough to ruin the movie. <br /><br /> Find this, it is one of the best KK movies of HK from the early nineties. Just remember that it is not friendly for children.']
