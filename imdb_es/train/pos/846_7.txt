Two years ago I saw "The Matador" in the movies and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously, I was totally impressed with the magnificent role of Pierce Brosan. Yesterday, I saw this movie again on TV, so I looked at it a bit more. Now, I can say with certainty that this movie is not that special, but you should just love it for one man. <br /> <br /> Brosnan raises his rating in my opinion with the incredible performance of Julian Noble, a tired hit man who has no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, a man who had bad luck: his son died in an accident, his work is not going so well and he is not sure he can keep his wife Bean ( Hope Davis). br /> <br /> I always liked movies like this one; Crime movie with great touch of humor. Mainly, that humor comes from Brosnan when he tells jokes about dwarves with great d ... or one of my favorite phrases in this movie: "I look like a prostitute from Bangkok on a Sunday morning, after the Navy left the city " Brosnan says it with his charm while drinking his margarita as usual. I also like the "typical American face" of Greg, Kinnear, in the role of loser who is very animated because there are many people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> So I recommend that you see the best possible paper. Brosnan never. It will make you smile and admire it at the same time. Great Brosnan in a not so good movie.
