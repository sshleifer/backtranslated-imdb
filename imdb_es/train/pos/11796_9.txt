Just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times, it would have been enough to pay attention to this two-part movie made in 1980 for television. But the fact is that it is a magnificent recreation of the life of Reverend Jim Jones, who built a church in a virtual empire, and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a cult of poor quality in which a congressman and his entourage were killed, and 917 followers of the cult committed suicide by drinking Kool-Aid soaked with cyanide. <br /> <br /> Made with great taste but horrifying enough, unlike the insulting sadist CULT OF THE DAMN, GUYANA TRAGEDY has a star cast, including Ned Beatty. (as Rep. Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it's Powers Boothe (in his first big role) that really stands out as Jim Jones. In fact, he has become the man, and his performance is fascinating and chilling. Therefore, it is not surprising that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
