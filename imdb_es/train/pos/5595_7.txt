Polanski returns to the themes of loneliness and madness that he explored with such a tremendous effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, in The Tenant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is a trademark of Polanski: dark, melancholy, disconcerting, but there is something I feel uncomfortable with this film and I am not sure if it is deliberate or not. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, does not do justice here. As its name was one of the things that really attracted me to this movie, I was a little disappointed with the amount of really impressive movie scenes that are in the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really allows the movie below is the performance. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten more than he can with the difficult role of Trelkovsky. Some of the supporting actors are excellent, especially Melvyn Douglas as the owner and Shelley Winters as the concierge, but others are weak and moody. It is also difficult to overlook the fact that all these supposed Parisians have American accents. <br /> <br /> Quite unexpectedly, there are some good dark comedy moments in the movie. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is undoubtedly a good comic actor. However, there are times when he is dangerously close to being a parody of himself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat inexplicable) 'transformation' is more likely to provoke giggles than eyebrows, which takes away what should have been a powerful moment in her psycho-dramatic journey. <br /> <br /> In short, the tenant is a pleasant and intriguing experience, although a bit languid for his own good. There are a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and an atmosphere of discomfort and constant premonition, but this film, although it is very good, does not reach success as successfully as it could have done. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the end of The Day, a Polanski movie "well" is still better than most other "good" movies. Definitely worth a watch, just do not expect to be dragged.
