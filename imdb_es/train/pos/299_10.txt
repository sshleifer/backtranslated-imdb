Peter Bogdonavich has made a handful of really cool movies, and THEY ALL RIEDHED is one of his best. The cast could not be better equipped to interpret this light but bittersweet comedy. Curiously, the ingenious and light touch that Bogdonavich employs with so little effort gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. Fresh and immediate, the film begins without any explanation. There is no soundtrack music to guide us. We find the characters in action, and while Bogdonavich glides through the streets of New York, the film unfolds effortlessly. The camera of Robby Muller captures everything with a discreet simplicity that seems accidental, but surely it is not. The cast is excellent. In every way, a classic.
