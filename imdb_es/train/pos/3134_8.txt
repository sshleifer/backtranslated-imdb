This was a well-written story of Making of the Batman Sitcom and actually brings together our heroes in a great search, as well as offers the history of their television shows. Unlike the documentary films of the Brady and Partridge family, we not only look at the past and present lives of Adam and Burt, but we also see them in action again. Filled with Kapow's and catwomen and the Riddler (s), Batman is back in a well-told story, which not only gives us a satisfying close of the Batman series, but fills the modern fanatic with all the Hollywood stories about they do not have 'It has been heard in 35 years. <br /> <br /> Kudos !!!
