I do not know much about the Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra always seemed too self-conscious to me. So when I call this one of my favorites of all time, it has nothing to do with a tribute band mentality. As another critic says, Mad Dog Time is about symbolism, not about realism. He is Kafkian (a pity that Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd, when he was as good as Josef K), he is elegant, wise, sardonic and cunning. Jeff Goldblum is navigating a variety of characters, trying not to get shots and acting dexterously rather than clumsily, trying to keep up with what he knows and others do not, who he can beat and who can not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (their best performance) have a ball, and the supporting cast looks perfect. The symbolism, the settings (the only outdoor movement with Jeff Goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much relaxation in the living room), the dialogue (style, not in practice, is the order of the day ), it's about characters that interact, it's not really gangsterism. Fun to watch, it must have been fun to do. What the critics did is really a mystery ...
