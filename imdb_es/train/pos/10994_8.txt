This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I saw everything by luck one night on TV. At the beginning, 5 minutes, I thought it was a B movie, but then I understood the incredible product that it was. <br /> <br /> I suggested some friends to watch the movie, just to tell me it was bad news. B movie What wrong superficial criticism. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is almost a product of genius! The well-known director did an excellent job here and it's a shame to say he was out of the game all this time.
