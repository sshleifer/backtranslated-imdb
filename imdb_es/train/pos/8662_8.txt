I loved it. In fact, if I see it again (and I plan to do it), I may like it. I will echo other critics by saying that this movie really grows in you as you watch it. It starts a little slow, but the way it is wrapped is very natural and has a certain mood. You just get into that. <br /> <br /> I really liked the summer mood of the film and I thought the movie was very moving in general. The characters have a strong element of realism and the film weaves a spell very slowly and gently as you get involved in the various interactions between them and want to know how it will end up and what paths the characters will choose. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this; there are dark television movies that have more comments than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing I will do For example, I have missed the ending, which is driving me crazy and I HAVE to see it again to see that. This is a film that may not be for everyone, but I think it is very underestimated (even some of my most fanatical friends purists of cinema who have seen almost all the movies that have not seen this) and it seems that they do not even have it. Much of a message board, but I really liked it and all those who like family dramas that are warm in terms of scenery, atmosphere and a languid pace without hurry, should probably take a look at this. Especially worthy of note is that it takes place in South Carolina, so for those (like me) who love the South and the movies that take place there, this is a gem. I will add my vote to the unfortunately few comments and recommend this little known film.
