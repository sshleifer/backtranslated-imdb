I liked Top Gun. He kept my interest. Predictable plot, development of decent characters and plot. It is quite similar to High Noon in that the people of the city seem weak and are afraid to face a villain. This movie has some quality actors who did not really have the opportunity to share all their talents. Also some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a handsome man in his youth. John Dehner, Rod Taylor are outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did the best he could with poor material. It's hard to imagine him as a gunslinger. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a nauseating character. She seemed flattered that two men had been fighting over her. Ugh Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
