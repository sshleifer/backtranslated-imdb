It is a very good movie, not only for the fans of Lady Death comics, but also for those who like animated movies / adventure series and fantasy. <br /> <br /> The film is about an innocent girl who is about to die. for something he had not done, but for being the daughter of the ruler of hell, Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> Then look for revenge ... and the rest is better than you see in the movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, the characters are like the original comics, by Chaos. I never had the opportunity to read the first parts of the story in comics, just the last ones, after the movie passages, so I can not tell you if the events are exactly like the comics, but ... one way or another It's the story of Lady Death!
