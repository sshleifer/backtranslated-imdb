I grew up watching Scooby and I've been a fan forever. This caricature moves away from the same routine that can bore viewers. The routine of Crooks in Mask grows old and this caricature is a change from that. It's not meant to replace the Scooby gang, it's just a break from the same crime scene, for both the spectators and the writers, I'm sure. The focus of the cartoon is on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherit a large sum of money and use that money to thwart the plans to conquer the world of a mad scientist and his thugs. From time to time there are small tributes from the gang and the gang. If you are a Scooby-Doo fan, you can still appreciate the bond between a child and his talking dog, along with the jokes that accompany it. Just enjoy Cartoon and support the creators / writers and producers so that this is not the last Scooby Cartoon.
