This game was really great and a challenge. It has a great spooky story and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all Horror fans and it is very exciting from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that I would have liked to have more weapons, but that's just for me. <br /> <br /> A really great game for fans of RPGs and Shoot'em'up.
