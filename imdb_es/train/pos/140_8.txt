I do not usually like series. Everyone is predictable and they tend to get bored and bored very fast. <br /> <br /> However, these series are well played, the story follows all the episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still be Catch your mind. <br /> <br /> All the episodes are recorded in a hospital and take you further and further into the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lie just below the surface of the powerful hospital.
