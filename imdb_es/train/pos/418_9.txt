['This is a western of roar and I have seen it many times and it is entertaining at all levels. However, if you look for the true facts about legends like Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane, look elsewhere, as John Ford suggested that this is the west when the truth becomes a legend, print the legend. The story moves at a dizzying pace, and there is a great dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur, two very visible stars that help make this film. The highs among you could see Gabby Hayes as an Indian Scout, there is also a very young Anthony Quinn who makes his debut as a Cayenne warrior, actually married one of Demilles&#39; daughters in real life. In fact, his character Quinns who informs Cooper of the Custer massacre said in a flash back, the end is fine. ready and when the credits accumulate, the western United States merges with the history of the United States. So take some time to see this western classic.']
