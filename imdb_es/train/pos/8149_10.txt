The first time I saw this movie was in 1994 and I just saw it recently and it's still fun. I do not know if you have to understand the hiphop in the 90s, but it helps if you do it. In the 1990s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal conflicts within the groups and members when they separated (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There were also the wapp b, accessible rappers who begin to make the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams of C & C Music Factory, etc.). This movie makes fun of all that in a way that seems like it's really a documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spends a year in the life of a fictional rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Revenge of the Nerds, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence)). They are a promising rap group whose politics make them controversial. The good thing about this film is that it is so big in its representation of the hiphop industry of the 80s and the way it mocks. But, if you know the rap of the 80/90, you know how much of this is true. Still, on its own, without the knowledge of hip hop, it's still a fun and funny movie. And for all who ask, yes, Spinal Tap was first, but Spinal Tap is not the first fake movie either. This, in my opinion, is equally funny and in some way, better than Spinal Tap. As Spinal Tap is for heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is for Rap. And the songs are also available. The DVD is full of extras to include NWH music videos as a group and as soloists. Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
