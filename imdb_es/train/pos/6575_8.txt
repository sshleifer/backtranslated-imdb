'Arms and the Man' is one of Shaw's funniest works if handled correctly, and this production does a good job. Helena Bonham-Carter, star of the pre-movie, is Raina, daughter of a military family, who has a peacock boyfriend (Patrick Ryecart), and who protects a soldier from the enemy (Pip Torrens) during a raid on the city. . <br /> <br /> Full of color and energy, this production is moving at a good pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as maids are outnumbered by the rest of the cast, they still maintain their soil. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are lovely, and the game in general is happy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
