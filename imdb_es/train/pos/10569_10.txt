Intelligent, gritty, witty, fast-paced, sexy, extravagant, sordid, erotic, sincere and cheesy, Footlight Parade is a first-class entertainment, what film is about. <br /> <br /> Realistic, satirical The treatment gives a new touch to the material and its rhythm and delivery lines are impressive. To think that they only started to make photos spoken 7 years before this! The brilliance of dialogue can not be compared anywhere nowadays, especially considering that "realism" has taken over and enveloped contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie was made at a time when the Hayes code restricting content was ignored. The result is a fresh, self-referential, critical and alive cinema that spoke directly to the contemporary audiences that suffer through depression and the general anguish of the time. I recommend watching any film from this period, that is, 1930-1935, for a glimpse of what popular cinema can potentially be.
