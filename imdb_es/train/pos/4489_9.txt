['This movie is NOT about a fight between cats and mice as indicated in the other comment. It is a cat that has used 8 of its 9 lives and now lives with the fear of losing the last one. The cat is nervous and scared to death all the time, hence the name &quot;cat fraidy&quot;. Fraidy Cat&#39;s previous lives haunt him as ghosts that are from different eras in time and are constantly trying to kill him, but he is the most fearful of the ninth life that is represented as a cloud in the form of number 9 and spits out the light . Very old bolts now, but it would still be fun for the kids if you got a copy. <br /><br /> I saw this movie almost every day as a child: o)']
