Before Cujo, Lucky the devil dog. In 1978, on Halloween night, the movie "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell" was released. The story of a family that gets a new puppy (from a farmer who is simply in the neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables) because his dog, the boss, was killed. Coincidence? Everyone loves the new dog, but there is something strange about it. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for Father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) to begin to notice. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, Where the Boys Are, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) is different and his children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and the teacher, Hello Larry, Tuff-Turf) have also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with that? He is determined to discover and do whatever is necessary to save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because Ike and Kim have a darker side to what we saw in those mountain witch movies. This is one of the many horror films made for television in the 70s that were really scary for a horror movie made for television. The music was spooky and even the ending that I will not tell you made you think. <br /> <br /> This film also stars Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not get away from the devil's movies, remember "Race with the Devil"?) <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
