- Having grown tired of the rat race and living conditions in New York City, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children. He is hoping to find simple life. But, building a house proves to be anything but simple. As the headaches and bills begin to accumulate, so do the laughter. Will Mr. Blanding get the house of his dreams? <br /> <br /> - What makes this film so special are the three main actors: Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Any of the three is capable of taking a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost all the scenes are special. Grant has always been one of my favorites in this kind of role. He is so good at playing the husband. Loy is always a joy to watch. The Thin Man films he made with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become one of my favorites in the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, one of my favorites in particular. <br /> <br /> - The movie is definitely a product of its time. I love imagining a time when I could build a two-story, three-bedroom, four-bathroom home with an income of $ 15,000 per year. Add the fact that your two children attend a private school and you have a maid who lives at home and becomes almost fanciful. <br /> <br /> - However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and problems in which Blanding are found are easy to relate to today's. And that's where comedy comes into play. How many people have done some of the stupid things that the couple do in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the subplot of "wife in love with the best friend". It really is not necessary for the plot and it feels out of place and very uncomfortable as it presents itself.
