['This movie is wonderful. Always has been, always will be. What I want to say is really what is better than a maiden who falls in love. Walt really made himself here. And music! A dream is a wish that your heart makes is beautiful! What else can be said besides excellent? I can not wait for the special edition to come out, it will be amazing! I can not wait to hear all the songs deleted! This movie is made so beautiful and smart! It is adorable. What&#39;s up with cute mice too! I know I keep saying the same things over and over again, but this is a great movie! Woods was great in this beautiful and beautiful movie BEAUTIFUL']
