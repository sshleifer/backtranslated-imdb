In an era of such horrible cartoons, I'm quite surprised to see a film with such good morals that it reaches the bottom list of IMDB animated films. <br /> <br /> This movie contradicts the first one. I will not deny it. However, when I was in the target age group for this movie, I did not even realize it, and it would not have mattered if I did. The people who did it may have used "New Generation" to notice that this is another way that the Care Bear Family could have started. Maybe we should decide for ourselves how the Care Bear family really started. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite movie at 3-6 years, and it did not scare me or confuse me at all. <Br /> <br />
