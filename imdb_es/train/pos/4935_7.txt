The mayor of the city assigns the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint find the killers infected with the plague and inoculate them. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the Streets" reveals a simple story, but it's still effective and with a great villain. The attractive plot has not been dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance makes a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while trying to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "PÃ¢nico nas Ruas" ("Panic in the streets")
