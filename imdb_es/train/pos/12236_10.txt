I saw this movie in 1959 when I was 11 years old on a drive-in with my family. <br /> <br /> Back then, I thought it was very funny. . . Although I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful movie a delight! I saw him again this morning at "Turner South". As I looked at him, he was absolutely convulsed with laughter! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic from a bygone era. If you are too young to have experienced the lovely period in the story that this film produced, I am very sorry for you. There's no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can (even today) deliver such a lovely piece of heaven to "veterans" like me. <br /> <br /> Having said that, all I can do is respectfully request that younger people refrain from commenting on movies like "The Mating Game". <br /> <br /> Movies like this one were created for the generation that preceded the current group of its people. And as such, these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words, if you do not understand the problems the film is aimed at, do not be embarrassed by offering comments, which ones? frankly ?? Has no sense.
