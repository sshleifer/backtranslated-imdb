Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm sure I'm glad that I have now! He's one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself as completely in his craft as Eddie. I could not stop laughing for the whole show. If you like to laugh, you MUST see this special!
