**** SPOILERS **** The movie "Sniper" is based, no doubt, on the feats of the legendary sniper of the United States, Carlos "Gunny" Hathcock. The unassuming Mr Mister Rogers, who has a soft voice, has accumulated a score of up to 300 unconfirmed and unconfirmed Vietcong and North Vietnamese assassins during his two "Nam" tours. Which shows how deadly and effective a trained military sniper is. is. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is a great and deadly clam like Sergeant Thomas Tometkett who is at the end of his career as a sniper in the US Navy. UU but that later in the film he realizes that a life as a civilian will be useless. Since it has nothing to do with his skills he learned in the US Marines. UU Unless he decides to become a hitman. Backett reluctantly accepts his destiny as a lifelong professional killer for his country. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie "Sniper" focuses on the Sergeant. With the support of the former silver medalist and the agent of the US government. UU., Richard. Miller, Billy Zane, being sent to the depths of the Panamanian jungle. The two snipers will take rebel general Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa, and Colombian drug trafficker Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, who supports him in a planned military assault on the country. <br /> <br /> We see it earlier in the movie Sgt. Beckett reach out and take out a rebel leader that I think was the best scene in "Sniper". This is shown step by step how the sergeant. Beckett with the help of his custodian Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. There is also a secondary plot that was later aborted in the film about a rebel sniper DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who was harassing Beckett and then killed Papich while both waited for a military helicopter to take them out of the jungle. You would think a deadly cat and mouse were playing between the two that would culminate when the movie ended, but Sgt. Beckett had no problem sending DeSilva to the beginning of the movie using a confident Miller as bait. <br /> <br /> What most hurt the film was, ironically, the last fifteen minutes, approximately, when the story went from one to the other. He fired a sniper movie from a murder to a Rambo type ending with the sergeant. Beckett and Agent Miller fight a whole battalion of rebels with bullets as thick as a London fog. <br /> <br /> The "sniper" is still worth the fact that it tells the story of a person who even today, war movies have not been really glamorous: a lone assassin who kills with the precision and the skill of a master diamond cutter or an accomplished neurosurgeon and that he does so in total secrecy.
