My personal feeling is that you can not divorce this film from its political / historical foundations as many of the (American) critics tend to do. It's not about growing up on Main Street, USA. UU It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was divided between the East and the West. Just like the boys are divided between Esther and everyone else, and Esther is divided between the "Tovarish Joe" and the boys. There is shame in certain situations that is lost in an audience that has never lived under Tito. I feel that the movie is undervalued and it's a shame we lost the director. Movies like this make freedom feel more important. It's not just "another Eastern European adult film" ... it's a sensitive portrait of teenagers walking in a fine line that could lead them to true freedom.
