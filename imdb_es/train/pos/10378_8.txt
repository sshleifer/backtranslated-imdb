This movie is about an hour of good entertainment and has some really fun moments. I loved Matt's character, and also Tiny. They seemed the most attractive and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is his good cousin), and the policewoman and the blonde biker woman give her a nice welcome. I must say that I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Australian actor, Eric Bana. My personal favorite part was the brothel scene, I loved it. In general, I liked the movie and I will get a grade of 8. However, the penalty disappointed me. It was a lateral curl, instead of the proper explosion of the laces. <br /> <br /> I'm kidding, of course. :)
