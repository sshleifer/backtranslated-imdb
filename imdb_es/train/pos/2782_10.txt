"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that had very little exposure here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the film was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and had a lot to do with football, (soccer here), that some may have trouble interacting in the United States as well. It's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserves a lot more coverage here. I think the basis of the story, (after a dream), is something that many people can relate to and, in the end, "Bend It Like Beckham" proves to be a good feeling movie with a source of inspiration and a performance really good. I was not too excited to see this movie initially, but now I regret not having seen it before. I recommend this movie!
