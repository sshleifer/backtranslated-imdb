['I just saw this movie in advance and all I can say is ... &quot;What did I just see?&quot; And I say it in a good and bad way. <br /><br /> The plot is very simple. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is the most concentrated worker, while Black is a dreamer. Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases the poop. The idea becomes very popular, and the black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black wins and the fact that he still tries to be Stiller&#39;s best friend makes Stiller go crazy with envy. <br /><br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is simply strange. The direction is strange, with a strange rotating shot opening to accelerated sequences from nowhere. Dialogue and acting are very strange; I miss in a kind of way of walking. And the sound track is the strangest thing about the movie, the strange song &quot;Envy&quot; that keeps reappearing in the scene where you think you&#39;re going to listen to a classic song from the 80s, but suddenly it&#39;s in Japanese. <br /><br /> So, the real question is this ... is it funny? That depends purely on the individual. I was laughing at the incessant rarity of the movie. After the screening I heard people calling him horribly without grace and happy that it was free. Interestingly, I understood your point. There are no jokes at all, so if you do not get hooked by the uniqueness of all this, you will hate this movie. I absolutely hate it. <br /><br /> This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a classic DVD. If you can laugh at a movie without real jokes, like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I suggest you see it. If you do not, run away from this movie. It will only drive you crazy.']
