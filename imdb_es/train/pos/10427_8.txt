Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on a European train. The two come from very different backgrounds, he is American and she is French, after talking a little on the train, Jesse gets Celine off the train and explore Vienna with him. During the following hours, the two wander through Vienna assimilating everything the city has to offer and become madly in love with each other. But will this new relationship last until dawn? <br /> <br /> This wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air for a genre that has been in decline. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" never bores because of its small cast. In fact, it flourishes because of the wires that make you love your characters and have a wonderful charisma between you. Intelligent dialogue makes this a must for lovers of romance
