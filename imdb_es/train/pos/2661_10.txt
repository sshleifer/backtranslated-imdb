... This is not the first time Stanley blurs the distinction between genres with such a large effect, either. In Dr. Strangelove he had a comedy about a horrible situation, and here the base is a scary scenario that actually produces some very funny moments. The madness that burns slowly and the attempt to kill one's family is not hilarious, of course, but the dialogue is very wise ("five months of peace is what I want ...") and there is an excellent drinking scene that would be rampant if it included only one type of spirit, but it is chilling when the other is taken into account. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The indications that Nicholson provides to the public as an actor only hint at the potential of madness, which only reinforces when we learn that the head of the family has fought against alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. However, the environment in which he finds himself absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them on his conscience. In the same way that buildings are sometimes thought to absorb the events that take place there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a worried but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to take him beyond the point of no return. He may have latent defects in his personality before he arrives, but to me, the Overlook in itself is the trigger. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's cold and distant approach to directing works splendidly for a cold horror movie, and Jack Nicholson's unpredictable force of nature is teetering all the time between making you laugh and scare you . When it explodes, you will not be sure how far it can go. Together they formed a great team and with a mixture of their talents they gave us a classic. If you want a great visual experience, this is an example that really shines ...
