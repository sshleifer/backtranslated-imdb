However, with regard to the Muppet line, this is not the best, nor the second best. This was marketed to children, but it has some dark and emotionally disturbing adult moments, which parents do not want to expose their children. One of which shows Miss Piggy as a "postcard" in a jealous fury, which lasts basically for the duration of this work. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, however, the story is progressive and highly entertaining. A scene in which Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go crazy in a department store is simply funny! And there are other parts of this work that contain the same level of lightness and fun. <br /> <br /> I really like this and I still enjoy it today. <br /> <br /> It has a rating of 7.6 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
