Good. This has been a favorite since he was 14 years old. Of course, I no longer see it several times a year, but ... This is not a movie for an older generation that wants a deeper meaning or a brilliant message. This movie is fun. It's pretty outdated, almost outdated, but Parker Posey is so bright that it's amazing. If you want to be captivated with a Breakfast of the 90 in Tiffany's, attended the praises of the 90 or that you love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not bother.
