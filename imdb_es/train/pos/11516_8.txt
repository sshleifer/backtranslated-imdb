I'm not a John Cleese completista (although I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I'm a fan, and when I saw this session, careless, on a shelf of my local Blockbuster, I decided to try it." What I got was a wonderful surprise, and one of the funniest 50 minute visualization experiences I've ever had, writing is a typical "goon show" program in English, in fact, like an audio sketch, this would not be out of place in an album. Firesign Theater. "But the execution and timing are right and this elevates" Strange Case "to the kind of amazing performance that can be created by fans of British comedy for life. <br /> <br /> The British have a gift to combine widely satirical lampoons with observed ticks of character and time, and the creators use both to get good results here Cleese's portrayal of "Holmes" seems to be largely due to Arkin and Seller's "Inspector Clouseau," however, Cle he has such a special ability for physical comedy that he has something more than his own. But the unexpected treatment Here is Arthur Lowe, who plays "Watson" as a great imbecile but invincibly incomprehensible with such excellent time and dedication that it becomes the best aspect of the film. I had never heard of Lowe before this (his past seems to be vaudeville and musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Some people may not do it. Take care of "Strange Case ...", especially if the British whim is not your "cup of tea". But I am extremely happy to have seen this before it disappeared from sight.
