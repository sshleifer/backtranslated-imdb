What can be said about Tara Fitzgerald's convincing performance? She is completely credible as Mrs. Graham wounded, hardened by experience, sharp and strong-willed, but not immune to Mr. Markham's passionate attentions. Through every malicious look and every flash of bad temper, every flash of discernment in his eyes and facial expression, Toby Stephens is a master of his character. He is the force of passion and hope that will restore the wounded spirit of Helen. Huntingdon de Graves is a perfect performance of the unreformable rogue. However, despite everything he has done, there is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to interpret the hypocrite at the end; he is, at least, aware of his own failures and how they have brought his ruin. Helen's attempt to save her soul - after leaving it and taking her son away at a time when this was not known - is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of every human life and soul, without how wrong they may be, even if they are sinful. Markham's constancy can then be seen as his reward for his unshakable faith and moral character. Although the ideas of morality expressed so strongly in Tenant seem to be outdated by current standards, history is permeated with integrity, passion and conviction, which still have an impact. The tenant is much more credible than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; Here is an adaptation that does justice to the novel. I highly recommend seeing it!
