I think the context of the story has been covered by other posters, so I would like to write about the impact this movie had on me. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was in the year of its release, approximately, in 1987. My school organized a trip to the cinema to see it, for an ER project, I think. We all left, of course, excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! Little did we know what we were about to experience. To this day I still remember the feelings he invoked me and I remembered crying a lot like most of my friends were. I think that at our age we found it shocking and silent, indignant with our own youth. It shocked me so much that I joined the Movement against apartheid the same year. <br /> <br /> I think it fulfilled its purpose in my case.
