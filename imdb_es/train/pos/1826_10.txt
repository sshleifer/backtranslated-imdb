I loved this movie when I was little. Today at 17 is one of my favorite animated films of all time. Beautiful animation and attractive characters are just two of the things you like about this movie. Although many people do not enjoy some of the songs, most are well made and agree with the story. It focuses on Charlie, a roguish and handsome German Shepard who may seem unpleasant to some at first ... but will eventually win. <br /> <br /> It is not a movie for children in any way. Often very dark and scary at times. A gift for fans of Don Bluth and animation fans. But keep a handkerchief at hand. ADGTH never stops making me cry and will do the same for those who are sensitive to the movie. Arguably one of the best non-Disney animated films of all time. Along with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: A celestial masterpiece.
