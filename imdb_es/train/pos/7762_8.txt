In her autobiography, Laureen Bacall reveals that Bogie told her not to make films as dubious as this or something like that. At that time, Douglas Sirk was labeled "Weepies for Women", in fact, he was restored to favor, at least in Europe, after he stopped directing. And when he filmed "written in the wind", Sirk only had three films to do: "Misty Angels", "A time to love and a time to die", his masterpiece, IMHO, and finally "Imitation of life" ( 1960). Then there was silence. Actually, the characters of Bacall and Hudson do not interest Sirk. They are too righteous, too virtuous. Dorothy Malone, who was a kind of substitute for her former German star Zarah Leander, and her brother Robert Stack provide the main interest of the plot. built continuously, most of the movie is a long flashback. The instability of brother and sister, from a family of wealthy Texas oil owners, is highlighted by flashy clothes and glittering cars that go at top speed in a derrick. landscape. The metamorphosis of Malone at the end of the film is impressive: costume and bun, playing with a small derrick: it is ready for life, the rebel is domesticated. Now alone, because she lost Hudson (but, anyway, he was not in love with her). This ending is a little reactionary, but the melodrama is reluctant par excellence; three years later, in "imitation of life", Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohner) will be blamed because she does not know her place.
