I liked this movie. I remember there was a very well done scene in this movie in which Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) lies in his pot smoking in bed and then begins to visualize that the Ramones are in the room with her singing the song. "I Want You Around" ... very cool things. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, quirky and great. Yes, I will admit that the ending is very exaggerated ... but it does not matter because it's fun, this is a very funny movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll forever <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was the band that was originally the protagonist of this ... But I do not know if this is true or not
