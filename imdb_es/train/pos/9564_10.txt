This must be the best movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> Combine an impressive cinematography with an impressive performance and an exciting plot, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog I grabbed onto the edge of my seat during some scenes, recoiled with horror during other scenes and left myself drowning in my own tears after the tragic end. <br /> <br /> The movie left a deep impression on me. It is a surprisingly violent scene that contrasts sharply with the touching and tender scenes of "love". The movie does not deserve its Cat III classification (nudity); there are no nude scenes at all, and "love" scenes do not even involve kisses or "kisses". <br /> <br /> The message that this movie presented to me? All human beings, no matter how violent or cruel they may seem, have a tender side. Edison Chen does an excellent job playing the role of the murderer Pang. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie on 10/10. It is a must.
