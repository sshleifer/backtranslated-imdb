Wonderful family drama / comedy starring MacClaine and Garr that entertains and warms the heart every time I see it. Highly recommended for all ages, from 9 years to grandmothers. Enchanting period piece that captures 1962. The story covers Garr, his two sons and Aunt Zena (MacClaine) who try to survive without a man as head of the family. The "family" heads west to take the inheritance of a long-forgotten relative who has left Garr a path down, a rickety cafe on the side of the street, starting in the late 1940s. The tenacious Garr, like the sweet but determined mother, takes the whole family to the restoration and opening of the coffee. But wait ... Aunt Zena is an old circus artist with card tricks, magic powders and a sense of humor from buffoons. She loves that she and the children participate in silly and sometimes dangerous games ... ... What happens next is a charming combination of "Miracle at Lords" launched along with the Cuban missile crisis (with real news) televisions of the real event) and a "ghost" joke that is totally out of control. This film entertains, philosophizes, questions religiosity and gives a disconcerting look at the frightening threat of the Cuban missile crises of October 1962. In the end, one is left with the wonder of faith, family and love rediscovered. Oh, and the music of the early 60's era is just fantastic! <br /> <br /> STRONGLY recommend as FEEL GOOD FILM 10 out of 10
