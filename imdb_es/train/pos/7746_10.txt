['Those of you who know the DEUS group, know the singer Tom Barman. He directed this movie a bit as if he created music, it&#39;s a mix of everything. This is a comedy, although it is mostly absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters has a happy life to say the least, and does not really have a goal. <br /><br /> The film begins on Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes of several people, some of them have nothing in common, but will come into contact with each other during the day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books that nobody reads, a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister, a gallerist, two young people in constant contact with the law, a man who works in a cinema and two women Throughout the film a man walks that has something to do with the wind. All the characters have their problems, with their family or friends or only with life itself. <br /><br /> The film is set in Antwerp and shows several beautiful photos of the city and the port. The events of the day are not easily explained, I advise you to simply watch the movie, there is simply a lot to tell. But I can say this, Barman has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mainly dance music, not really rock) to create an atmosphere, especially the party is full of excellent music. <br /><br /> This movie is an experience in itself, it will not leave you wiser about life, maybe only that you have to live it and not waste it, or have false moral truths. <br /><br /> In summary, see it, it&#39;s definitely worth it!']
