Seeing this movie once again, this time it seemed infinitely superior to the previous one. The performance is incredibly wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply excellent as the wandering son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are equally good in all aspects. Robert Redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of madness of the twenties. The landscape is incredibly beautiful from the mountains and streams of western Montana. In short, this is one of the best movies made in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You must see this movie! <br /> <br />
