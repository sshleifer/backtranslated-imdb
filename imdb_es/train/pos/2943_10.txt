I think this is still the best routine. There are some others, such as "Bring the Pain" from Rock, and "Men are Pigs" from Allen that are hilarious; "The last fight of Damon Waynes" is also fun in a heartbreaking way, but this routine has no errors. All jokes are fun, and the 70 minute time limit is perfect. Just enough time to last 20 years. I love how he allows the audience to be totally free and without restrictions. I'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who saw Jim Carrey grow up, seeing a more relaxed comic is great. Do not put in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can see if you're bloated. Thanks Eddie, God bless you.
