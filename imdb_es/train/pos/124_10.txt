* Contains spoilers because I have to describe some film techniques, so read at your own risk. * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. The use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it look like an old photograph comes to life. I also liked the projection of people on a back screen. For example, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she projects behind him instead of a typical split screen. His face is huge on the back and Leo is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses of this is when young people kill the Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style. , with facial close-ups. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense and constant style along with the dew of red to convey tons of horror without much blood. The same goes for the scene where Katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub ... you can only see the red water on one side. It's one of the things that I love about Von Trier, his underestimation of horror, which ends up making it more creepy. <br /> <br /> The use of the text in the film was unique, as when Leo's character is pushed by the word, "werewolf". I've never seen anything like that in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this movie was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Leo's uncle. Bring the laughter I got from his role in the Kingdom (Riget). This humor makes the plot of the absurd anal retentivity of train drivers in the terrible context of WW2 and all the chaos, easier to take. It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital administrator tries to maintain a normality at the end of the first part when everything is going crazy. This shows that some people are truly oblivious to the horrible things that happen around them. However, some people, like Leo, are tuned in, but they do not do anything positive about it. <br /> <br /> The voiceover, performed expertly by Max von Sydow, is also fun. It attracts you to the story and makes you jump at Leo's head, which is sometimes a fearsome place. <br /> <br /> The film highlights the fact that one is a coward if they do not choose a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where the character of Bjork does not speak for itself and ends up being its own destruction. In fact, at some point, Von Trier seemed anti-woman, playing Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that their male characters are not doing well either! I found myself in the same place during the end of Dancer, when you really want the main character to rethink his actions, but, of course, they never do!
