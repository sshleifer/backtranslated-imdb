['If this had been done previously in the Zatoichi series, it could have been one of the best. It&#39;s good enough, like most of them, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. The situation is unusually intriguing: farmers in the province have two champions, a benevolent boss (for once) and a samurai philosopher who starts a kind of Grange; both oppose the usual local gang members, who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling income and their chances of winning some land; his chief or powerful ally is an apparent puritan who is death in drinking and gambling, but who secretly yields to his own perverse appetites. (He also looks like Dracula, since the villains in Zatoichi&#39;s latest films tend to do so). These characters have enough meaning to deserve to face Zatoichi as originally drawn, but now it has lost many of its nuances. , and the changes in some of the characters, like the good boss and the angry sister of a man that Zatoichi has killed, need more time than the film to give, so the story seems ragged, as if some scenes were missing. Apart from that, the film shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyric photography, the creation of a vivid, credible and singularly recognizable landscape (whose absence is evident in the occasional episode where the director simply misses it), and a technical quality that, by its nature, is disguised: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets, so that their limitations do not seem to exist. And, of course, there is the main actor, whose presence, as well as his performance, makes everything work. This must be one of the best sustained series in the history of cinema.']
