"Hundstage" is the first fiction film by seidl (before this he directed great documentaries such as "animal love" or "models"). Seidl worked on this project for more than 3 years, but it only cost around 2 million dollars. The actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors who almost interpret themselves. Cinematography is also good. The whole movie is shocking and disturbing and some scenes may be too much for "normal" viewers. The film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also that people are alone and can not communicate with each other. Finally, I must say that this is one of the best and most rewarding films of Austria in recent years. please excuse my bad english. <br /> <br />
