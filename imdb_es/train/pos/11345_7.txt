That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This terrifying movie (a musical) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> A child departs on a magical trip to an island. The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, supposedly a dragon, looks more like a triton with conjunctivitis for me, and a magic flute that speaks is the goal of a witch (Billie Halliday, who at that time was considered "a little good" ). <br /> <br /> The flute recovers in an "interesting" witch convention, with the witches having a gay moment. The child dresses with the dragon and then as a "fairy" to retrieve the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
