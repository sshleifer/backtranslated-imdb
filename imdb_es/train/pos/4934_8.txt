"Panic in the Streets" is a rather unknown little film by director Elia Kazan and was performed before her classic masterpieces such as "A Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan already won an Oscar in 1947, before this film, so it was not completely unknown at the time. Still, "Panic in the Streets" is mainly a movie that went under the radar. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script. He has a very good concept and his excellent taut thriller material with a smell of crime / film-noir elements. The dialogue in this film is also absolutely magnificent and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. <br /> <br /> The cast is quite unknown (especially at the time of its release) but still has Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first film roles. Especially, Palance impresses as the leader of the gangsters, with a very powerful face. <br /> <br /> The film is still a bit prolonged in some points. The film starts very well, but after the beginning, the film slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of rhythm and the point of view from which the story is told. <br /> <br /> However, "Panic in The Streets" is still a perfectly visible movie, mainly due to its solid script and the powerful dialogue that makes the film believable to watch. For fans of the thriller genre, this is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
