Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they see this movie? I love! One of my 10 best movies of all time. It just makes me feel good. I see the closing production number with all the cast members over and over again! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is THE movie babe, IMHO! I never saw the play, but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the movie. Both are like apples and oranges. The filming process will rarely deliver a finished product that is true to the original work. I think that just because of the fear of public alienation, many of the well-known works adapted to the screen are not modified any more than they are. This is a very good movie, it is very satisfying. This is all you need to know!
