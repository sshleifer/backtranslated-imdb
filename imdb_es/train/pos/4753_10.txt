['In a series full of brilliant episodes, this one stands out as one of my favorites. It is not the deepest episode, there is no great meaning or message. But it&#39;s very funny, and there are some good performances. <br /><br /> But what really makes it stand out is that, to my knowledge, it&#39;s the episode * only * of Twilight Zone with a * double * end of snapper. The Zone is, rightly so, famous for providing a great surprise at the end of a story. But this time, you get a surprise, and you think that&#39;s all, but it turns out there&#39;s * another * surprise waiting for you. I just like it so much, that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other is a deeper one, more message-oriented).']
