An American in Paris was, in many ways, the best mix of Hollywood art and music. Made to match the powers of MGM as a musical powerhouse, the film presents memorable music by the Gershwins, who rightly have been called the 20th century equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film, although it could reasonably be argued that this film was just the warm-up for his best work in Singin 'in the Rain (1952). The two films are really linked. Apart from the connection of Arthur Freed, the segment of Broadway Melody in "Rain" owes its existence to the incredible sequence of American Ballet de Paris in this film. This could have been the only time a dance number was mentioned especially in the opening credits of the film. And it deserved to be that way, as it shows Gene Kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer in all its splendor. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is uniformly excellent. Leslie Caron, incredibly making her film debut, shows a maturity that makes you think she had been making movies for years. His introductory dance sequence, and later his work in the Ballet, provides some surprisingly sexy moments that compete with MGM Musicals just for the work of Cyd Charisse in Singin 'in the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is hilarious as the stoic friend of Kelly, who gets two of the best moments of the film: during the sequence of the final party (which I will not reveal to anyone who has not seen the film), and one of the most musical numbers Memorable from the movie that combines his incredible skills with the piano with the most modern special effects (for the time being). <br /> <br /> Less memorable are Georges Guetary as Kelly's romantic rival, although she does have some outstanding musical aspects, and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron's romantic rival. The May-December relationship between the character of Kelly and Nina reminded me of the same "conserved man" relationship that was seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal at breakfast at Tiffany's. <br /> <br /> There are some elements of the movie that they made It's less satisfying to me than Singin 'in the Rain. The ballet, although luxurious and well produced, does not fit with the rest of the film. Without revealing the plot, the ballet simply happens, without rhyme or real reason. And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence, it really has nothing to do with the plot, and in the best musicals, the songs always have some kind of reason to be. <br /> <br /> To make things worse is the end of the movie that happens immediately after the Ballet. Although the ending should not be a surprise (this is an MGM musical, after all), I expected a little more ... a movie after the Ballet ended. It's as if the director Vicente Minnelli felt that he could not follow the Ballet with anything else. The movie literally left me in the lurch. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, An American in Paris is next to the best of Hollywood musicals. It does not reach the heights of Singin 'in the Rain, but it is close and remains a testament to Gene Kelly's abilities as one of the best dancers of all time.
