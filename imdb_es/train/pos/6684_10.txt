It's a good movie. I love it more every time I see. Most comedies can get pretty boring because they know all the jokes, but the mysterious men have as much integrity in the writing and characterization they once again observe, as Ben Stiller rips the hood limousine ornament, or Hank Azaria he says goodbye. For Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush presents his choreography of fuhrer, or Tom Waits mumbles while watching the story, or Janeane Garofalo rejects a kiss from Paul Reubens, it's a pleasure. This is the perfect set for the performance. The story develops in a direct and coherent way, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the configurations give results at the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, look at it again and, if you have not done so, start. You can not see it again until you see it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the test scene, too many good things!)
