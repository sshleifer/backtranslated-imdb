How powerful and captivating is the quality of cinema. This film tells its story with everyday scenes that manage to reveal the hidden commotion inside. It is true, as others have said, how this film really makes clear that Hollywood is lost because of its special effects, its exaggerated emotionalism and its extreme climatic extremes, and it has forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism. Much of what these characters are going through is implicit in the scene rather than explained in a verbose dialogue. One aspect that I enjoyed a lot was the contrast between the two brothers, one very openly expressive in its infantile form and the other completely stoic but both capable of evoking deep emotions. The older brother needed to say little, as he used to do, everything was there in his expressionless face! Beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, great direction! Do not be surprised!
