This movie really surprised me. I had my doubts about it at the beginning, but the movie improved every time. <br /> <br /> It may not be for the audience seeking action, but for those who like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, man, lover and husband. If you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> The plot is something difficult to follow at times, but in the end I think it improved everything. The ending was unexpected since they almost dirtied you to think that it would end differently. <br /> <br /> As for the performance, I think it was good. He will not be ready for an Oscar award for a long time, but at least he caught my attention. Gil Bellows' portrait of a prison man is not always perfect, but it is very entertaining. Shaun Parkes' portrait of fellow Bellows prisoner Clinique is excellent and extremely powerful. On the negative side, I think I'll put Esai Morales in Markie's portrait. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice and watch this movie, you will love it or you will not like it!
