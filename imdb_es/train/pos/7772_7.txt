['On October 24, 1955, the Hadley Oil Company&#39;s geologist, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), meets with executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in the office of his boss, Bill Ryan, in New York and invites her to attend a conference. with the alcoholic playboy and son of a mogul Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way to the meeting, he confesses that they had traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the desire of the reckless Kyle, who is his best friend since childhood, to eat a club 21 sandwich and the meeting was just a pretext. to Kyle&#39;s father, Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love with Lucy, and Kyle uses his unsuccessful money to impress Lucy; Then he opens his heart and offers Lucy. They get married and travel to Acapulco and the insecure Kyle stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle&#39;s sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is an easy woman and is in love with Mitch, who considers her a sister. A year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem and can be sterile and starts drinking again. The jealous Marylee poisons Kyle by telling him that his wife and Mitch are having an affair. When Lucy discovers she is pregnant, Kyle believes that the baby belongs to Mitch and his mistrust leads to tragedy. <br /><br /> &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; is an overrated melodramatic telenovela, with artificial characters and situations. There are at least two great movies with characters with problems with drinking: &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945) with the impressive performance of Ray Milland and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (1962) with the incredible performance of Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has reasonable performance and his character&#39;s motives for drinking are superficial and clich√©s. In the end, the forgettable &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; is just entertaining and never a feature to be nominated for an Oscar. My vote is seven. <br /><br /> Title (Brazil): &quot;Palavras ao Vento&quot; (&quot;Words in the wind&quot;)']
