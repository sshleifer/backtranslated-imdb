Three weeks, finally releasing gas from the deadly well that caused the deaths. The esteemed designer Erno Metzner creates rigid sets that simulate tragedy, providing a perception of reality, augmented by unparalleled sound editing, with the only music produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and end of parts of a work for the one that the auditory effects have the same importance that the fascinating visual compositions of the eminent director.
