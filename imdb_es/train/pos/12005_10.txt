This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being LDS, I recommend this movie because you can feel more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film was not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is an extraordinary film that changes the life and that everyone can enjoy and appreciate. I watched this movie with my family and I can testify that we have all changed our mind. This film allows people to really understand how difficult life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he faced. After watching this movie, there was not a single dry eye in the whole room. Everyone was moved by what they saw and I have not been the same since I saw it. I recommend this movie for everyone.
