['&quot;Secret Sunshine&quot; reminded me of &quot;The Rapture&quot; (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better movie. It represents Korean super religious Christians in a provincial city of Korea, and the experiences of the main character interacting with them in the wake of a horrific personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a single widowed mother who moves to the city of Milyang (&#39;Secret Sunshine&#39; in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son. She chose Milyang because her late husband (killed in a car accident) was born there, and she feels that she needs to start life again in a new place. She does not react well to the objections of local Christian fanatics, one of whose members tries to convince her to come to her church and to prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and clears these people as politely as possible. In fact, to begin with, it alludes to almost everyone in Milyang, but some of them persist in trying to invade their world, and the consequences are often fun. To say more would be to give away the film, but it must be taken into account that the performance of the woman in the main role (Jeon Do-yeon) is great. After reading that she won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2007, she hoped that she would get a decent job. But Ms. Jeon is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on the screen. The film is a kind of harrowing work by Evelyn Waugh-esquire, which shows how fate can feel as crazy as strangely inevitable.']
