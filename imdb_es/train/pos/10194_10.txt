This would have worked much better if it had been done as "Mitchell in Malta". At least then we would have been spared seeing Joe Don Baker running across an otherwise scenic, Mediterranean stage in that ridiculous-looking cowboy outfit ... not to mention that we acted like an Old West gunman. If Mitchell is Mitchell, the film would not have suffered a lack of free police brutality either. Oh good. At least the comical comments of Mike and the Bots made this rate pleasant as an episode of MST. However, I can not imagine seeing him alone.
