['&quot;Der Todesking&quot; - Georg Buttgereit&#39;s second full-length film (the first was notorious &quot;Nekromantik&quot;) does not have a central character or characters, but a thematic continuity in the act of suicide. Divided into days of the week, it is composed of a series of elements, each of which presents the self-destruction of a complete stranger. Yes, the production values are low and disturbing, but in many ways &quot;Der Todesking&quot; is extremely effective. It makes you think what is sometimes more important than pure entertainment. Unlike the other works of Buttgereit, it is not very bloody, but there are some unpleasant images such as the castration scene in the episode on Tuesday, a decomposing corpse and several acts of suicide. The last episode (Sunday) is so depressing and full of pain! Simply amazing if you want my opinion! 10 out of 10! Take a look at this shocking postmodernism! The disturbing art in the purest form!']
