I enjoyed this movie. It was fun, cute, silly and entertaining. He had an excellent cast and some critics criticized him for reasons that I really do not understand. No, it was not "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was a nice movie. <br /> <br /> Julia was excellent at playing the psychotic 'man behind man'. The story is a bit silly to be sure, but this is not a big drama, folks. It happened that I saw a review of the movie, probably the only good one that I got and one night I found it when I was looking for a movie. I never knew I should stink until after I saw it, and I'm glad I saw it. I finally bought the VHS tape in the bargain stack, and I see it a couple of times a year.
