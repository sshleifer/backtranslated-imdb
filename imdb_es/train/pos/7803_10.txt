I just finished watching this movie in my GCSE history class. It was exciting and it was a brilliant idea of ​​what really happened to Steve Biko during the time of the Apartheid law. How can anyone say that this movie was the most boring or boring of 2 and a half hours of their lives, I do not know because I was hooked from start to finish. It was great how Denzel Washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting the Apartheid law and for obtaining the same rights for blacks. In one part, Steve Biko tells a policeman that we are as weak and human as you are, to show them that he and all the other blacks in South Africa were no different from whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he was strong for what he believed and did not believe totally in apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and woke the world. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I highly recommend it to people. It helped me to see that racism is not right and that we are all equal, its destiny should not be determined by the color of someone's skin. north
