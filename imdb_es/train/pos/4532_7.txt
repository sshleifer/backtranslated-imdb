This was the first feature of Keaton and currently there are three shorts, set in different periods (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age) in the eternal triangle of romance. The stories are parallel to each other as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which he intended to satirize. The strengths of jokes and jokes are almost all based on anachronisms, which makes today's business become old scenarios. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING: THE SPOILERS CONTINUE TO MAKE THE BEST POINTS ******> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Using a turtle as a table for birds (Stone Age); A wristwatch containing a solar sphere (Roman epoch); A car with spare wheel (Roman era); Using a helmet as a tire lock (Roman era); Early golf with sticks and rocks (Stone Age); Dictating a testament carved in a rock (Stone Age); The changing meteorologist (Roman time); The race of cars in the snow: Busters using skis and huskies with a spare dog in the boot of the car (Roman age). <br /> <br /> All the above are disposable gags that make us laugh. However, there are also unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster taking out the shaving equipment to match the makeup of the girl; The fantastic double take when a drunken Buster looks at his plate to discover a crab staring at him (within a second, he has jumped to stand in his chair from a sitting position and jumped back into the arms of the waiter, one of the most funny moments I've seen). And that lion, the manicure, just brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is also a bit of discolored racism when four African-American flag bearers abandon their lover for a game of Roman garbage. <br /> <br /> The Kino print is a bit blurry and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate damage and film damage, probably at the ends of the rollers. The Metro function is marked with piano and flute and a lot is taken from Grieg. <br /> <br /> A lot of fun and lots of laughs.
