Keep in mind that I did not say it's better ... just nicer. Lack of social commentary and realism help keep things moving. <br /> <br /> Actually I was surprised that it was not a Troma movie, as it has all the trademarks of Troma, even the expulsion of acid liquids. villain after each murder, a ridiculous rape scene in the bathtub (which is a bit difficult to dislike, since the rapist is a snowman), and silly deputies. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, on which it is observed that it has no legs or feet, leads to a police cruiser through the city . <br /> <br /> 2. Although it is supposed to be close to (or below) the freeze, you can not see your breath and there are no signs of car exhaust when the cars are running. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow reminds you more of herds of polystyrene or polystyrene than real snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenage girl gets the consequences for her boyfriend only a few hours after his brother has been horribly killed. She convinces him to enter the sheriff's house, from all places, to be able to move on. But first, she tells him that he has to make a good fire in the fireplace and open some wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After Jake's head of a teenager is cut off by a sled runner, his father argues with the sheriff if Tommy, the sheriff's son, had something to do with that. The sheriff maintains that Tommy would not have been fighting with Jake because Jake "is at least two feet taller than Tommy." At that moment, someone in the background says: "Not anymore!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman finally begins to melt, the sheriff fights a flat snowman made of some kind of cloth for a prolonged period. This is much better than Tarzan's fight with rubber crocodiles or gladiators fighting with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I would not have been able to keep a straight face at this time. <br /> <br /> In short, a fun movie. There really is not so much blood.
