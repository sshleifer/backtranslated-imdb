Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by the German director Ulli Lommel. Directs, produces and co-stars in this latest production. Not only does he make an interesting movie at a low price. But it reaches a new level when Herr Lommel works on sequences of almost all his film catalog. I've seen movie clips from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes a cameo from beyond the serious courtesy of this movie). Although it uses many old images, it reproduces them well (and could very creatively add them). <br /> <br /> The film follows a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. it also corresponds to a writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about the serial killer in the late sixties and early seventies. The writer's friend (David Hess) helps him to try to find this aspiring Zodiac. Can this killer be stopped? Will writer two and two join and claim something of his former glory? David Hess is still man? You will have to discover it for yourself and see the zodiac killer. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT about the original zodiac killer. I have also listened to people who complain that this movie was filmed on video. And that. The artistic style of the old school of the director eclipses the fact that it was filmed on video. My only complaint was the excessive use of archive images from Herr Lommel's previous films (but I understand why "wink", "wink"). I do not believe in the hype. This is a street level horror movie. Like the disclaimer in the initial states, this movie does not glorify murder. You like that statement. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for fans of Ulli Lommel.
