At first, this is from England, so, of course, it had a 98% chance of being an intelligent and very good cinema. I had never heard of this movie before. From the moment I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here comes the female version of My Left Foot. He was right, but he was also wrong. Bad because the two films are very different. My Left Foot was a film similar to John Ford and this is a film similar to Chaplin (not because it is funny, but to Chaplin because of the great sense of melodrama that makes your eyes cry). He was right because in 1990 the handsome Daniel Day. Lewis became a little ugly when interpreting a crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality. Here, very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and it is very intelligent. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter gives one of the best women of the 1990s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Caramba! And look at his eyes! I had the most beautiful eyes of the cinema since Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She is also a true talent, as seen in many other films. Look at this, you will not regret it! And a very good job for Branagh too!
