I have no idea what the other critic is talking about: this was a wonderful movie, and it created a sense of the time that feels like a journey in time. The characters are really young, Mary is a strong couple for Byron, Claire is young and a little annoying, Polidori is a defeated and convincing flatterer ... they are all beautiful, curious and decadent ... they are not the terrible wrecks that are in Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as an independent piece of shock film, and I loved it for different reasons, but it works like a Merchant and Ivory movie, and it was from my readings the best capture of what Summer is must have felt. Romantic, yes, but it completely rekindles my interest in the lives of Shelley and Byron every time I think about the movie. One of my all time favorites.
