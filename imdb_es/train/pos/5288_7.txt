This fun cartoon of Bugs Bunny sees the return of the still unnamed Marvin the Martian and his companion K-9 the green dog. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of trying to destroy Earth, Marvin is on a mission to land, Capture a creature from Earth and take it to Mars. Of course, the creature he chooses is Bugs Bunny. At first, Bugs thinks that Marvin and K-9 are trick or treating, but he realizes that this can not be correct when Marvin drastically enlarges Bug's rabbit hole with a ray gun. Bugs tries to fool himself out of the situation in several ways, including persuading Marvin that K-9 is planning a riot. Finally, he is captured with a bazooka that expels an Acme straitjacket. Surprisingly, for an Acme product, it works as advertised and Bug's is forced to use its ingenuity to get K-9 to release it, the tables are changed soon and the two disgruntled Martians are tied and Bugs is trying to return the dish. to the earth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this, although the ending is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice has changed slightly here and it becomes emotional when he gets angry, but that did not make me like him or the caricature.
