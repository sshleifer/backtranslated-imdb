VIVAH is in my book THE BEST MOVIE OF 2006! PERIOD !! In my book it is one of the best 100 films that have been made in Bollywood. It is sad that this film does not have so many criticisms and does not have as much popularity. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is once again a true achievement of a director who DOES IT again. After that HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj once again obtained a brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> This is the simplest and most beautiful movie I've seen this year. After seeing Don 2, which was CRAP and later, Dhoom 2, which even won Don in that matter, I finally see a movie that is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture we have and we're making Hollywood-style remake movies like Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and it is very much related to the Indian system of arranged marriage that I would also like to be part of. Our system, which teaches us to obey the elders, to follow them and, of course, to obey their thoughts, is shown brilliantly in this film. Of course, there is no strength to choose your life partner and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and it is up to them to decide how to show themselves brilliantly in this film. <br /> <br /> Returning to the film ..... VIVAH is a Journey story between the beautiful period of Engagement and marriage. The phase in which the boy meets the girl! ... Both understand ... Both try to assess whether they can love for seven generations (as our system says) and the various situations that occur during marriages. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is fine ... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are amazing! The songs are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like the HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> In general, YOU MUST SEE anyone who still believes in the culture and tradition of India, and I certainly do! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I just have to say a word ....... <br /> <br /> TELL!
