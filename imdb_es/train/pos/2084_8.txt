My main problem with the movie is that it lasts too long. Apart from that, it's pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage. Luise Rainer is a maid who marries Muni. They live with Muni's father on a farm and they are doing pretty badly. When you finally get some money to buy more land, a drought occurs and nothing grows. Everyone starts going north because Muni is left behind at the beginning. When they leave and arrive in the city, they find that there is no work and they are worse off than before. They even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money, but they decide not to. When a group of people begins to loot the city, the military appears and begins to execute people. Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won a second Oscar for this movie.
