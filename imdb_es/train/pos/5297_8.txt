I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was quite full and we all laughed so hard that it was easy to miss the lines. I knew it looked like it would be good, but it was much more fun than I thought. I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed very weird like normal people, if that makes sense. I get tired of movies that show teenagers as people who cut cookies, like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate. I will recommend this movie to all my friends and I will look forward to it coming out on DVD. Go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I plan to see him again in the theater and I will not see things more than once very often.
