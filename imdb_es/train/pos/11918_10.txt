['&quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; was originally a 1951 film from the Ted Turner library; Disney remade it in 1994, this time, using the California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team (Disney used to own this and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team, also, good use of words, huh?). <br /><br /> This movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. A man promised the children a family, only if the Angels won the pennant. So, he called God one night about this. The child who prayed could see help on the way (and ONLY that child); for example, when the first angel had come down, a player hit a ball so hard that not only did the bat break, it was also the ball !!!!! For much of the 1994 post-All Star season, the Angels were at the top of the Western Division (AL) (of which my home team, the Rangers is one and still is). However, they lost a game because the boy was on the court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (there was not a Central Division in Baseball back then, so Chicago was in the West), and there were no angels to help. Thus, a new rule was created: angels can not help in championship games. But wait! In the final game of the championship, the Angels won !!!!! It was a miracle indeed! <br /><br /> What I liked about this movie: This is a good movie. I mean, I prayed every night for the past several years asking for help with school and those things; Look at me now! My work was good !!!!! So, on the one hand, this shows that if you believe, God can send His angels to help you with any problem you may have in life. And second, this is a family baseball movie, which is always exciting. This is an old Disney movie, too; I&#39;ve seen this recently on the New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /><br /> &quot;Angels in the garden&quot; will change your life forever once you&#39;ve seen it! <br /><br /> 10/10']
