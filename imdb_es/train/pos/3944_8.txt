This little movie had been on my "caretaker" list for a long time. Do people realize how stressed, women who suffer from emotional abuse and menopause (as well as people with mental retardation) were REALLY treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century? All the pious, strained Christian attitudes of that time were deadly to explore the true emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace the suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he recognized that women have emotional feelings and responses as big as a man? Think about it! The sensitivity of this movie still catches me and I credit the director for capturing this through his eyes.
