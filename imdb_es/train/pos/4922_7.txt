['I wonder what the audiences of the day thought when he first saw Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Certainly, it does not look like anyone else of the time, that skull-shaped face, flattened nose and elongated body, even now remains a disturbing presence. And what could be more appropriate than his departure from those slums of New Orleans that seem to resent the plague that Blackie is losing in the city. I only regret that there are no more scenes. <br /><br /> The film itself is very cleverly assembled: the black humor of the morgue, the interaction between Widmark and Douglas, the little touristic places, the battles between the officials, everything is woven into a realistic taut thriller with a threat different from that of others . Even the domestic Widmark scenes that put a woman (Bel Geddes) in the marquee are not too disturbing. Director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for directing a studio product (Fox), no matter how he feels about the commercial aspect. <br /><br /> Widmark does a solid job of low profile as the public health officer. But my money is in the only Zero Mostel. Was there ever a more sweaty actor who could scream louder or be pushed beyond the bulky boy of the fall (for example, The Enforcer, 1950)? That scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with the astute wife of Mostel (Liswood), is a jewel of frenzied submission when Mostel tries to pacify each one as a berserk pinball. Too bad he has lost so many years on the blacklist. (I wonder if it was the fickle Kazan who named him). <br /><br /> But not only professionals add color. The locals add character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the police. The whole scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan recognized his potential and formed a small witty scene in the place. Then, too, that color contracting room with all the hands on the cover is pure inspiration. And what about those coffee shops that have made me run to the nearest Denny&#39;s? <br /><br /> Anyway, the movie is still a suspense film with an apocalyptic air that oddly portends many of today&#39;s mega-hits.']
