If you were born around the time this movie was finished and you had a liberal / open-minded home that I have, I'm sure that in the early 80's, you will be taught to watch dirty or extremely dirty movies by your parents. films. You know, it's not 100% pornographic, but rather an alchemical mixture of real drama and pornography, or that you would sneak into its collection and appear in the representation of a plastic rectangle of that movie on a large dookie machine called VHS. You had to be very quiet and like a ninja, but you still had a minor heart failure when huge pop noises were made by pressing the tablet buttons for fear of being discovered. In any case, those films were sent to your mind, waiting and waiting to meet that visual "art". Needless to say, this movie fits into the aforementioned description of a "T".

Who can say it, but even though Mr. Borowcyzk's taste for vivid and raw sexuality is the "norm" of his works, I would say that, in fact, this film speaks to the viewer at a deeper level with respect to bestial carnality Once I learned this, the story became much more interesting beyond the vertigo of shock value and, therefore, it's worth checking out.
