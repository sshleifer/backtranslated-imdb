She was excellent, Franchot was unavoidably exaggerated (but he played similar roles in other films like "The Man from the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost nonexistent, but the film certainly "excited." <Br /> <br /> * slight spoiler ahead *: I wonder how many times he strangled Elisha Cook in his films, but I seem to remember other examples. I will avoid naming the murderer, but I think it is necessarily obvious due to the plot that the "suspense films" demand. <br /> <br /> A well-made but old-fashioned movie film (for example: they all smoked like crazy and the police were really ordinary characters) and dead bodies were never shown, unlike today's gore festivals in day, made in the family format of short frames of the time. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
