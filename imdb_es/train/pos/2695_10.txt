What keeps us moving, or at least what I think the writer wanted us to keep stuck in an early moment, is our desire to know if Martinaud has done the dirty thing. Without spoiling so much, of course, there is a red herring and a twist. But then we discover that this is the story of Martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in coping. When the revelation is there, we begin to sympathize and feel sorry because as the story progresses, we are made to think that it is the sick and perverted pedophile that we are predisposed to keep in mind. One of those things that he has to deal with is the distant distance that he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof. These problems, of course, receive their outcome in the shocking end of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie demands your patience and has certainly tried with the restless teenagers sitting in the rear. Obviously, they were bothering because they are not partial to the "central location" movies. Although there is a bit of travel, when we get to the forest and the beach. And we realize that Gallien is not as smart as we are made to think he is. <br /> <br /> The Inquisitor is 5/5
