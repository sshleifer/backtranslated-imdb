Five years after the Tenko survivors who returned home, and Marion's double sentence "Well, that's it." <br /> <br /> Now it's 1950: the moment of the meeting. The gang is here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica and the reincorporated Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is beautiful: as it is perfectly written and acted, and as suggestive and moving, as the original series. <br /> <br /> All the questions that were left hanging at the end of the series are perfectly answered here. From the Marion family to the Joss health center, everything has changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the better. <br /> <br /> A trip to the Dominica plantation brings many commotions and something really cutting edge. Seat tension. There is a real sense of tragedy and disaster when, once again, fate takes control and women fight for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colors, and there are some dramatic moments of shouting on TV. <br /> <br /> Filming in a lush place in Singapore, and the chance to catch up with a group of women who feel like they've made friends. It's a shame that this is really the end. I could see everything again. Perfection.
