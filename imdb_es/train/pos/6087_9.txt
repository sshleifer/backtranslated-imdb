I saw this movie in the first weeks that it came out (I do not remember exactly when). I thought that was fine, for a Ben Stiller movie. This movie is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you have to think about them. Or as I said, you have a good sense of humor. From a couple of people on this website, I saw that people had nothing good to say about it and did not get a very good rating, but it would have given a bigger one. This movie, I thought, was very good and should have got a better rating. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I'm just giving you the opinion of another person.
