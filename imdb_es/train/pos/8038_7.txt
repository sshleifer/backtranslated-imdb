Two snipers travel deep into the jungles in search of their objectives; a slobbery South American drug dealer and a prominent general. <br /> <br /> With a moderate success in the construction of an atmosphere of restlessness, Sniper is, in general, a very solid thriller, taking the time, establishing its characters and its difficult situation. In some good action sequences. The director Llosa is not always successful in keeping the mood gloomy and could have hardened the story a bit; some detours here do not add up much. But this movie is much better than your Stallone / Stone Specialist, The Specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane, usually incredibly annoying, does it surprisingly well, as the inexperienced Sniper joined the veteran Berenger. As for Berenger, this movie proved to be his last great big budget adventure in Hollywood. You can do this type of role while you sleep and it is very convincing here, repeating the role twice more in the direct sequels of DVD.
