Great documentary about the lives of firefighters in New York during the worst terrorist attack of all time. That's just why it must be a must for collectors.

Having said that, I now have a greater respect for firefighters and I realize that becoming a firefighter is a life-altering job. The French have a history of making great documentaries and that's what it is, a great documentary ...
