['I saw him on a flight to the United States and at first I was a bit skeptical, since some people had said there were so many characters that you did not know any of them. However I did not find this at all. The film is fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. The chase scenes are excellent and yes, it can be predictable, but that is not the case in most movies. The main villain is a bit disappointing, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but he said it&#39;s still a good movie.']
