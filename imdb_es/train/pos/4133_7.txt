An incredible little English movie for many reasons. First is a rare look at a Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. While his performance is not the standard he would later establish as one of the best actors of the 20th century, he is perfectly credible as the deceived lawyer. Historically, this film is of great interest due to where and when it was filmed. Being English, I did not have the big budget of Hollywood films of the same era and it is often shown, but the most interesting thing is the fact that this movie was filmed just before the war and shows an England that will soon disappear. When we see it today, we think in terms of modern morality and overlook the fact that this film and its closest American counterpart, "It Happened One Night," were once as risky as "Fatal Instinct" in our time. But after seeing and enjoying this movie the first time, I can not help feeling sad when I see it today. With half of the filming before 1950, saving the remaining films means difficult decisions, and unfortunately films like this are often overlooked in order to keep movies that we all consider important. The change in color, the lack of contrast and, in general, the poor quality of the print that is seen more frequently is heartbreaking. This movie, along with 'It Happened One Night', is perfect to cuddle with a lover under a blanket on a cool and pleasant night, or better yet, why not a double feature?
