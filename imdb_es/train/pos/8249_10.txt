OMG. This movie really shows the talent of the actors. Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscle. Truly an incredible man, if you look at Absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints as a madman / murderer, and then finally in Fido as a zombie! Your character in Fido looks cute to scary, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss is not a hack either! Jumping in the Matrix and Moment career as a darker character, to a conservative and comforting 1950 housewife! It is rare these days to see actors who can not be so pigeonholed. <br /> <br /> Now in the story (No Spoilers, do not worry). This movie would make happy Max Brooks (Author of Zombie Survival Guide & World War Z) happy! Finally, a well-made turn of zombies and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you're bored or if you're too busy, go see this movie!
