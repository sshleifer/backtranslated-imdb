This is one of my favorite family movies. I loved it when I was little and it still holds me now that I'm older. I still laugh at the same old jokes and I could even shed a tear once. I have never cared much about the animals that speak, or at least those animated by the UN, but this is what I will defend. It's a pretty old movie, but it will always have a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There is no other live animal movie that you can think of at this moment that you can even compare, let alone. I like it as much as this one. I may be giving too much praise to this movie, but I do not think it's a show. I really have that great message that "home is where the heart is". Or at least that's the message I got from him. Definitely recommended for a good family movie night.
