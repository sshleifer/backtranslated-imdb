Greetings again from the darkness. Much anticipated, the twisted comedy of writer / director Richard Shepard is a party for Pierce Brosnan, the actor. That Bond guy is gone. This new boy is something completely different! I read that Shepard thought that Brosnan was too pretty for this plum paper, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect "Nobleman" for Julian Noble ... and it's anything but pretty! Do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this. If you go, expect cranks and visual gags regarding all types of sex, murder, religion, sports, business and anything else that you may consider politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his wonderful facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a hat) is a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is the straight guy in the Brosnan comic book and has a lot of depth and comedic timing to make this association click. Hope Davis has a small but subtly effective secondary role as Kinnear's wife (what's her name "Bean"?), Who gets excited when she has a facilitator in her living room. <br /> <br /> The images and settings are perfect, including a bullfight, a racetrack and a suburb of Denver. And how often do we put The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit off-center and you enjoy making risky movies, it might be for you.
