['It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Simply a beautiful feeling and yet, it is never inclined to be soppy. There is a fantastic cinematography and the protagonist is quite brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of the time. He has a true heart for it. It is the achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I, for my part, am looking forward to his next project. Monitoring is always the most difficult. It&#39;s like the second blues album for most people. <br /><br /> I just hope that your next movie is not something lame like a shark movie. Greetings to all. Enjoy your movies']
