Nice movie, pure cassave style. Gena Rowland offers an impressive performance by a declining actress, who deals with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. She tries to escape from her own subconscious ghosts, incarnated by the specter of a girl's death. The acceptance of oneself, of the human condition, despite its general difficulties, is the true purpose of the film. The parallelism between the theatrical sequences and the film itself is surprising: it is as if the stage became an exit for the heroine. If all American films could be of the best quality, deal with human relationships on an adult level, do not try to infantilise and standardize feelings ... One of the best dramas of all time. 10/10.
