Apparently, Ruggero Deodato discovered, from the beginning, that his story would not work if he came too seriously, so he decided to camp. The result is a film that can be seen as an absurd epic of swords and witchcraft or as a very entertaining comedy. And I think I'm going down the second road. The brief moments of gore are well done, the Paul Brothers openly mock the material (they even bark in one scene!), And there is also a charming, energetic and kindly performance by Eva La Rue, like the girl. Let the labels along with the "guys". Also, where else can you see the inside of an illuminated dragon like a disco? (***)
