Does anyone know where this movie was filmed? The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful. It seems to be England. However, Ivy's apartment building certainly looks like the Brill Building, with its fascinating elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl appears as "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I blinked, but I never saw it. Maybe it was the husband's lawyer, but, once again, I do not remember that that character was in the movie, other than that it was mentioned that he had made a phone call. Maybe he was on the aviation scene? Or the ballroom scene? Did someone see it? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he shot this movie.
