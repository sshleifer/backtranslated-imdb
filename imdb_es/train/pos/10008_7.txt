You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these silly comedies he's done in this decade (with perhaps the exception of "Death To Smoochy", which he bombed when he came out, but now it's a cult classic). The dramas that he has made lately have been fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "Photo of an hour". "The Night Listener", despite the mediocre reviews and the fast release of a DVD, is among his best works, period. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary story, although it does not include a serial killer or anyone. That is physically dangerous for the case. The concept of the film is based on a real case of fraud that has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography of a boy named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrendous abuses and, as a result, contracted AIDS. The story moved me until I read online reports that Johnson might not exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams portrayed so brilliantly reappeared in my mind. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette probably also offers her best dramatic acting as the ultimate sociopathic "caretaker". His role was very far from what he had in films like "Little Miss Sunshine". There were even times when I looked at the camera where I thought he was staring at me. A good actress is needed to play that kind of role, and it is this underestimated role (though well reviewed) that makes Toni Collette one of the best actresses of this generation that has not been nominated for an Academy Award (from of 2008). It's amazing that there is at least one woman in this world who is like that, and also scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good dark film that I highly recommend. Prepare to be restless, however, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.
