I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The story line, although it required some improvements, was quite good, especially in season 1. However, season 2 became a rare show and lost the original charm of DA. The story line of the first season was more interesting, a clear side of life in Jam Pony, while a serious plot focused on manticore chasing the X series. I was waiting for new seasons, in fact, I still am. I hope the FOX guys and the DA production team realize that many people are still waiting for DA to come back. Even after 2 years of being canceled, the DA can do great if it is worked properly, and I believe that a name like James Cameron should take on this challenge.
