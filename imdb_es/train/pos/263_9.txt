This was a strong selection of Poirot / Suchet, television, mystery. The characters were alive and well acted. The plot and the main stage - a student hostel - were excellent. Japp was nothing special, but it did not distract me from the story. A significant point, many observers of Poirot do not recognize good performance or good characterization. I also believe that they are quite tough in their judgments of some of the mysteries of Poirot. Finally, I've read few novels of Christie (none in recent years) and it bothers me that so many viewers are upset by the changes in the novel. Please, spectators, consider what is presented to you in the film, not what you think should be there. That said, the mysteries of Poirot vary in quality, but not as much as the reviewers and evaluators would have you believe. With the singular exception of The Five Little Pigs, which was fabulous in plot, character and theme, Poirot's longest films are neither so good nor so bad. For the record, I have seen all the longer films of Poirot / Suchet. Finally, movies without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are not good or bad because of their absence. However, the presence is annoying (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant with Hastings. The lemon is in the middle.
