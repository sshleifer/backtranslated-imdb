"Match Point" and now "Scoop" have convinced me that Woody Allen is not only doing a good job making films in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the correct cast member), but he corroborated what I've known for years: should not. Do not focus on wealthy neurotic New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays the student of journalism Sondra Pransky, whom the wizard Sid Waterman (Allen) places in his vanishing box, where he meets the ghost of the murdered journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells him that the serial murders that have plagued London. They were committed by the millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Then, she knows him, and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell you without giving him away. But I can say that this is probably Allen's funniest movie in years. There is his unique and omnipresent style of humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> Then, I'm sure you'll like this movie. If nothing else, you will fall in love with London. But above all, it's so damn hilarious. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you have to love this one.
