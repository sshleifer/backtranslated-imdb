The first time I saw this movie was broadcast around 1988 by the BBC when I was working on the 2000AD in the United Kingdom. My friend Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and he sent it to me. Up to this point, I had really only seen the Shaw Bros kung fu movies, with their severe lighting (so that the audience could see the movements clearly), so it was a revelation for me to see something that seemed to have been illuminated by Ridley Scott leaving Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to the cinema of Tsui Hark (pronounced, apparently, "Choy Huk"). <br /> <br /> However, for all the smoke-filled exteriors, with backlighting and ambitious special effects (Stop-motion? In a Hong Kong movie?) At the heart of the HISTORY OF GHOSTS Chinese, there is a simple and moving love story, made even more real by the outstanding acting talent of Leslie Cheung (what a tragic and tragic waste of life!) and the elegance of Joey Wong. Granted, Joey is beautiful, but it is his balletic hand gestures that give his character an unattainable eroticism that is difficult to analyze. And although Joey is now almost 20 years older (gawd, which of us is not?), This will always be the lasting image of that actress. <br /> <br /> Some critics here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks surprises, but they lack the fact that this film was based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700. That's a Little to complain that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable ending and just copy WEST SIDE STORY. (I just wanted to get it out of my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, Chinese GHOST STORY is the quintessential romantic tale. It has a great tragedy, because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. It is about maturing, since none of us can mature until we experience a great loss. It is about sacrifice, because sacrifice is an essential component of True Love. And Wu Ma's comedy styles do not hurt a bit either. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the Chinese GHOST HISTORY by trying not to see it through a filter of Western culture. .
