This, along with "Hare Tonic", is one of the best Bugs cartoons, in fact one of the best Bugs in history. There are some comments about how Bugs in these cartoons is "basic", which means, I suppose, that it is not yet fully developed. In fact, I prefer this "basic" version of the mid-40s (Chuck Jones was the best version) that is actually more than the size of a rabbit and much more fun than the final version of long legs that dominated Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck The Bugs of the last days became too soft and sophisticated for my taste. You can also watch "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) to see great examples of classic Bugs and Chuck Jones.
