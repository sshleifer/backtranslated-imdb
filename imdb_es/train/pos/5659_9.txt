AG was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and suspense that is so rare on American television. Sheriff Lucas gave many viewers to the willies. We searched for Caleb as he fought to resist the overtures of Sheriff Lucas. We became absorbed and afraid of knowing the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations that caused each week the fear of what Lucas would do next were truly amazing. This show lived up to the nickname "Gothic" in the ways that American entertainment has tried so little, let alone dominated. The costumes definitely made a big mistake by not supporting this show. This program embarrasses the current excess of "reality" programs, which are so unsatisfactory to watch. The call for a DVD set is well based. This show is a quality visualization for a demanding market that is eager for quality visualization. An audience that is tired of the excessive saturation of the reality of numbing the mind will welcome this gem of real narration. Bring in the DVD set!
