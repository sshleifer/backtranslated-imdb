The plot: A crime lord is joining 3 different mafias in a company to buy an island, which would then serve as a money laundering center for organized crime. To thwart that, the FBI tries to kill one of the mafia lords. The thing goes wrong, and by some twists and turns improbable plot, we are presented with another film "police colleagues who do not like each other" ... one is an agent of the FBI and the other an agent of the DEA . . <br /> <br /> Until now, so stupid. But the strength of this film does not lie in its history: a poor joke, at best. It is funny. (At least the synchronized German version is). The action is also good, with a memorable scene involving a firearm and a rocket launcher. But the focus is directly on humor. It's not a smart satire, not a slap, but somewhere in between, you get lots of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. The misuse of legal drugs stands out prominently, without criticism, and even showing it as great. That is the part of the movie that bothered me seriously and makes it unsuitable for children, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> In short, to spend a pleasant evening watching an acceptable action with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Just remember: In this genre, it's common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the movie / TV room. Then you will have a good time. 8/10
