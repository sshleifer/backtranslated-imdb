This movie pushes you so deeply into the two main characters. I placed it on my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone the reviews) and I was intrigued for two hours in a row. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that is formed between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable, even with hardly any physical contact. Towards the end I could not decide which one I wanted the most: our hero and our heroine to achieve his success or simply consume his passion. RML could have done without a curious secondary argument and a traditional 100 minutes would have been enough. Although I'm stinging. After a series of failures of Netflix, Blockbuster and the local library, this film restored my faith in the creation of films.
