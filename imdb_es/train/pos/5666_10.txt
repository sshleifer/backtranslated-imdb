I loved this program when it aired on television and it crushed me when I discovered that someone somewhere decided it was not worthy of being continued. For years I kept my copies of this program, those I had recorded or someone had recorded for me. That is until now. The powers that finally decided to launch this beautiful series on DVD and finally I could put my anxious hands in the complete set. Which, brings me to this part; the part that this show deals with. <br /> <br /> American Gothic is about the good verses of evil, basically a fight between Lucas Buck (ie, Buck, with a B). He's an evil sheriff from a small town in South Carolina who handles things the way he wants things to run and does not stop at anything to get away with it. There is still a lot of life to live. I really hated when it was canceled, but that's the way it seems to me when I finally find something worth watching on TV. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole did a great job as the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he has the right amount of amulets and evildoers to achieve it. The other actors also did a super job, so I guess you could say that even the casting was a hit with me.
