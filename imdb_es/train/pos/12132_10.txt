Pleasant despite the performance of Leslie Howard. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat and uninteresting character. One is supposed to feel sorry for this man; However, I find myself cheering on Bette Davis' Mildred. Ms. Davis offers one of her best performances (she received an Academy Award nomination). Thanks to his performance, he gives life to this rather boring movie. ** Make sure you do not get lost when Mildred tells Philip exactly what she feels for him.
