I just saw I. Q. again tonight and I had forgotten how much I love this movie. It is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that everything is fine with the world. I love the allusions to Mozart throughout the opening with "Einstein" playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on the violin for him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ tests of Ed Walters. I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, a situation especially unique to the 1950s, the moment in which this film is developed. (I myself have been a teacher, but I stayed at home to raise my children, so, please, do not think I'm a stalwart woman.) It's wonderful that a man who is "just a fat monkey" is finally seen as such. Important and worthy as Catherine's fianc√©, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message for me is that we are not what we do, but what we are is defined by much more, there are no labels. There are so many small gags and one line that they are almost disposable if you do not look and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I captured some things in the movie that do not appear on the page of the errors. In the scene in which Ed Walters will speak at the symposium, there are 3 instruments (transporter, ruler, etc.) that hang to the right of the chalk cornice. In the next shot of the camera, there are only 2. In the credits of our video, the character of Tony Shaloub is shown as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti when he appears in the film and appears here in Imdb. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It may be a fluff in some estimates, but it has much more substance than many recognize. Not only that, what a great cast is gathered here. Watch it and enjoy!
