One of my favorite movies that has been overlooked by many viewers, an observation that baffles me. Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee, it had many young actors who would become big stars, for example, Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel , Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. The whole performance was magnificent and each of the aforementioned actors offered memorable performances, especially Meyers, who played an evil villain he killed for killing. <br /> <br /> When the director's biographies and achievements (even when he won an Academy Award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from his previous performances. I discovered the movie on DVD by accident and it became one of my most viewed movies. However, it is rarely seen in the cable. I hope to read what others suggest are the reasons why this movie is not well known.
