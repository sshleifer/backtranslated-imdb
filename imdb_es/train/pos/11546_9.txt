['First time to see: July 21, 2008 <br /><br /> Very impressive script and comedy acting and timing in this movie. Now 40 years old, he has not lost any of his power. Neil Simon shows an excellent view of human nature and relationships, as well as how to create a genuine comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances. Neil Simon was inspired by the real events of his own life to write the work on which this film is based. <br /><br /> One of the best written and performed Hollywood comedies of all time! <br /><br /> Surprisingly, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: &quot;Best Adapted Screenplay&quot; and &quot;Best Movie Editing&quot;. Hollywood rarely awards comedies, no matter how well they are done.']
