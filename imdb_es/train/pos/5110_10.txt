I was about 11 years old and I discovered that I live 0.48 miles from the uncle's house. The uncle's house is on Westway Dr, Deer Park, TX. They have added houses since the movie was made. I do not know the house number but you can go find it. Now I'm 21 and I enjoy watching this movie. Spencer's bar is not yours anymore. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school for them. I drove around the house last week the house still looks great. My dad and my uncle would go to the street where the house is and they would see the actors go in and out of the house trying to make the film. where John crossed the cracks of the railroad, they made 225 higher. When I learn that John loesing about his son, I begin to think that when I was an urban cowboy I was 26 or 25 years old at the time.
