The movie caught my attention, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I do not agree with some of the other publications on the basis that the plot was not complicated. I had no problem following him (maybe some people drank too much eggnog the night before). The movie was very sad and moving too. What else do you want? Alexa Davalos is a great new talent (beautiful too), and Tom Everett Scott also does an excellent job with his part. The relationship of mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the film was not. It was tragically sad but enlightening. Surely it surpassed the other programs that were on TV New Year's Eve night
