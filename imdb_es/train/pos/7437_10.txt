['Recently, a friend and I were discussing ethical and educational influences as we grew up in the 1950s instead of today. He mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who, in 1798, wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner. Both of us had been required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and English literature courses at the university. My friend said: &quot;Your messages could even be called metaphysical in the current context.&quot; <br /><br /> We try to recite it and we only remember parts and pieces. (I have trouble remembering Dr. Seuss). I said that I would get two copies of the poem so that everyone could read it. That was easy enough, but I was very surprised to discover that it had become a movie. We expected to see the movie to see how it had played. After all, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not exactly a light reading. After everyone had read the poem, we watched the movie together. <br /><br /> We consider the film a remarkable achievement, especially considering that it was made in the 1970s, before computers, before the so-called &quot;Ken Burns effect&quot; and before special effects began to compensate for the lack of substance. Particularly noteworthy are the illustrations of the 19th and 20th centuries selected from &quot;lesser-known artists&quot;, such as Willy Pogany, the Hollywood designer. <br /><br /> The film is narrated by Sir Michael Redgrave, who had taught the poem when he was a school teacher, and added a tone of authority and credibility to stay true to the poem. <br /><br /> His domain is in layers of subtle messages, transmitted without &quot;instructing&quot;, or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality story. We found such a refreshing change in today&#39;s face-to-face mentality and &quot;hitting them in the head&quot;. Most current morality messages in the cinema are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and chaos mark the bad. The bad guys are really, really, bad, and good are superheroes. It is as if the human character lacks any nuance. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a celebration of the individual, of character, of appreciation for celebrating all the richness that life has to offer, within the broader context of humanity, that is, the ability of man to give to others . <br /><br /> Proud of ourselves for having found this &quot;unknown&quot; gem, we later learned that it had won the first prize in its category five six times at the international &quot;name&quot; festivals. Another surprise was knowing that the director of the film, Raul daSilva, is a recognized authority in early animation and is the author of six award-winning film books. <br /><br /> The message of this film is just as relevant today, if not more, than when Coleridge wrote the original epic poem and when Raul daSilva translated it into the cinema. If I was still teaching in high school, which I did for five years, I would take this and show it to all my students. Here there is a level of wealth that naturally leads to the discussion about the great and important problems we face, whether in 1798, 1978 or now, in fact, as long as humanity has a spiritual component. <br /><br /> Highly recommended']
