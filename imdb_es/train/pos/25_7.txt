I never saw this as a child, so this was seen with new eyes. I had never heard of him and I rented it for my 5 year old daughter. Also, the idea of ​​Christopher Walken singing and dancing made me curious. The special effects are cheesy and the singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was fascinated. I loved seeing Walken in this role thinking about what the future would bring. Very fun to watch him dance! And if the songs were not great, at least they were not Disney's superproduced saccharine sweetness. At first, the ogre scene gave her a bit of fear, and she was a little nervous when we saw her again at the end, but it was above all benign. Interestingly, we had recently read "Puss in Boots," and had asked myself about the implausibility of the story. But while he remained faithful to almost every aspect, Walken's performance made him credible. Big fun. I would see him again with my daughter.
