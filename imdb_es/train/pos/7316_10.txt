This movie is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is exceptional, the music is as good as the movie and the killer is as scary as it can be! The actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr. Loomis, made the movie even better. Without it, the film would lack a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also excellent as our beloved queen of the scream. Her innocence makes her ignore the true evil that haunts her until she finds her friends brutally murdered in the house, which of course is one of the best scenes in the movie. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this movie because it scared me so much when I saw it in the early 80's and I still see it until today, since it is a wonderful movie that brings you to this world where you could be disemboweled like a fish. In each turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a crazy man with a mask that has escaped from a mental asylum and is ready to kill everyone in sight without them having the slightest idea that he is there, is Amazingly scary and pampers you even more. Film as events, although fiction could easily come true. We all know that, unfortunately, evil exists in this world and that a crazy man with a knife is not unusual, and that it is a very disturbing fear for all this. Death at any time. Halloween, of course, shows this in its most terrifying form. The horror must be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that becomes an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. In addition to the excellent story of Psycho, which I adore so much, I think formats are the best that horror has to offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I've seen and I'll see them all my life and I'll never tire of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
