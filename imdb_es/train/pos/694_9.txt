The nightmare of an insomnia is the story of a man's immersion in madness. Having chronic insomnia, Jack is plagued with hallucinations; causing him to try and determine what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We found interesting things about Jack near the end, and we thought that by the end of the movie we'll have a "Happy Never After" Hollywood finale. Incorrect. This is the city of New York, the place where nobody sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (Writer and Director) has a good movie in 'The Nightmare of an Insomnia'. A talented filmmaker and writer (she made this movie right after graduating from high school), she has real potential and will see it in the near future. <br /> <br /> While watching this short film, I was constantly uncomfortable; Between the music, the grim landscape and the realistic rendering of an insomniac by Dominic Monaghan (like Jack), he desperately wanted to turn this off sometimes just to get away from it.
