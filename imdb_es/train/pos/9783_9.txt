How could I say that Peaches, with his complex narrative that deals with a multitude of problems, is "a little television idea" surpasses me. Also, I can think of many movies that have "a little television idea" in their arguments. Her obvious distaste for the television industry ("Sue Smith has not risen above her television experience") is confusing. Particularly because you are having "a great time" working on TV. If only we could be as talented as Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative): Brides of Christ awarded by the AFI, Road from Coorain, etc. All done for television. Now that I think about it, what about those other "little television ideas" like "Against the wind", "Bodyline", "The dismissal", "Scales of justice", "Blue murder", "Water under the bridge", etc. . I think Peaches is a good entertaining movie that interested me, and also most of my friends, from start to finish. It's far from being impeccable, but I think it's among the best Australian films I've seen in recent years. Who knows, with a couple of visits more (there's a lot to think about), could be up to classics like "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground." I really enjoyed this movie a lot more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". I think these films had their moments: surreal, atmospheric, realistic and that they dealt with important contemporary issues, but in terms of total entertainment for me and for the average lady, and for me, it was very common, if not boring. When I go to see a movie, I am always aware of the reaction of the audience to a movie (through reactions in movies and conversations heard in the lobby and the bathroom). Some left Peaches shaking their heads, others with negative reviews, but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience.
