I loved this movie since I was 7 years old and I saw it on opening day. It was so moving and beautiful. I highly recommend seeing for everyone. It is a movie to see with your family from afar. <br /> <br /> My MPAA classification: PG-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disaster, nudity / sexuality and a bit of language.
