It's kind of crazy, but I recorded both TCM, this German version of MGM's "Anna Christie", and the English version ... but I could see it first, because I had heard that a lot of people thought it was better than the version in English. <br /> <br /> Without having seen the other one, I can not compare them, but anyway this is an excellent early talkie, with a direct performance from Garbo. She looks very beautiful in this movie, her face shines everywhere, especially when cameraman William Daniels receives those beautiful close-ups of her. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film seems different from the usual MGM made at that time, it looks a lot like the French or German expressionist films of the thirties, and was directed by a great French director, Monsieur Jacques Feyder, who directed Garbo in 1929 in "The Kiss". <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is excellent and offers an absolutely incredible performance like the love of Anna, the hard, hard, sailor, who is only a child in the body of man. Also Hans Junkermann offers a very good performance, as the alcoholic father of Anna and Salka Viertel, as a cheap and good-hearted old floozie. <br /> <br /> In an entire experience, because it is the only movie in which you can listen to Garbo speak in a foreign language ... because all the other films he did in Sweden or Germany, were during the Silent Era . <br /> <br /> Serious Flick.
