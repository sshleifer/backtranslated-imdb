['Steven Speilberg&#39;s adaptation of the popular Alice Walkers novel is not without controversy. When it was first launched, members of the black community criticized their treatment of black men, while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women. <br /><br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, who grew up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two sons of her abusive father who are snatched from her arms at birth. His only consolation in his miserable life comes from his sister. <br /><br /> Celie (played in later years by the newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) is married to an abusive husband (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by the sister and therefore, she is quickly expelled from Celie&#39;s life. <br /><br /> The story is often heartbreaking, as Celie hopes that one day she can reunite with her sister and children. Throughout his life, he encounters a variety of characters, including Sophia, a wife as tough as his stepson&#39;s wife, and Shug, a noisy and delightful lounge singer, who teaches him one or two things about him. love. <br /><br /> The direction of Speilberg is in this whole image, which offers a brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances. I encourage you to watch this movie and do not move! The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story. While it tends to minimize the lesbian aspects, as well as African history, which were so vivid in the book, the film remains true to its themes, allowing the voice of Alice Walker to shine. <br /><br /> I could not begin to respond to the controversy surrounding this movie. Suffice to say that, however, this is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again, and that has left me an indelible mark. <br /><br />']
