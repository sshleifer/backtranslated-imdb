This show was fabulous. It was intricate and well written, and all the characters were nice without being horribly sweet. Even Jonathan Cake, the filandering boyfriend, was nice. Since our airwaves are full of junk like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that was not like a soap opera. It was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance. It really is annoying that we finally have a program that makes you think a bit and that is rejected because of a mysterious number that most of us do not even pay attention to. Some of us are not sheep. Maybe you miss this show not by many people, but by some very loyal fans.
