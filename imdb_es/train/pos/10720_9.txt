Hurrah! A space movie that does not take itself too seriously and everyone can join us on the exciting journey that is the space camp. The film begins slowly, the usual mixture of idiots and high-flying are mixed in a dirty soup. But when things get difficult, the difficult ones are solved and it is not an incredible change in the characters, since you can believe that there is some responsibility in their young minds. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the movie is that Kate Capshaw is EXTREMELY upset as the "I'm right and you're wrong" instructor. I would recommend this as a good night in a movie and a vote of 7.
