Jane Porter's former love interest Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) come to the hidden escarpment of Tarzan, in search of the ivory gold mine that is the "elephant graveyard", which was seen by The first time in TARZAN, THE MAN OF APE ... only that we soon discovered that both men have hidden intentions ... namely, Jane. Will Tarzan represent that? It is not likely (in fact, Tarzan will not even tolerate any disturbance caused by the "Elephant Cemetery") and, knowing that Martin tries to get Tarzan out of the picture, only he will find himself later in a world of problems, he and his group (including Jane who leaves with them after she believes that Tarzan is dead) is captured by a native tribe that tries to feed the lions ... Will Tarzan have the will and enough capacity to arrive on time? <br /> <br /> This movie is an adventure filled with lots of scenes involving Tarzan and other wild animals and a climax that captures the viewer's interest and does not stop. The cruelty shown towards the animals and the representation of the natives can disturb some of them nowadays, but everyone should remember that this is basically a game of fantasy adventures and adventures and that they should not be taken so seriously.
