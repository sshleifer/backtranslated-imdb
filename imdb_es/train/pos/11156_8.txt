In general, I do not like reality shows, especially those that are benefiting from the success of "American Idol". But with which I can live. <br /> <br /> Comedians around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent hunters, and if they like it, they will send those guys to perform a routine for a real audience. . Then, ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and make "Survivor" style competitions using comic tactics. Then one will be determined as "Last Comic Standing". I like stand-up comedy, so this is the only reality show that should interest me in my interests. Usually there are some pretty funny comics selected through. He started the talent career as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is the fact that there is a possibility that many of these comics have been selected for their contribution to reality. show drama At first they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they have eliminated that, thank God. <br /> <br /> And there are many comedians that I felt, they were only chosen not because they are fun, but because of their race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc., when other comics clearly should have overcome them. But in general, it's a well-done reality show, which are two terms so far that I thought were an oxymoron.
