I probably saw this movie for the first time in 1995. Since then, I've been back many times. It's great! I especially like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "Civilization Rising". Woohoo! This was great in the glory days of CG animation. CG is much older than me, since I know that the movie "Tron" was made 7 years before my time. But this movie was a milestone in the early 90s. It was probably the first collaboration of different CG experiments with music. I like it so much, I think I'm going to see it now. Goodbye
