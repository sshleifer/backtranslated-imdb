Well done and elegant, while it still makes sense, this thriller would work best for fans who are not giallo and became more interested in the genre than later Argento entries that go overboard in all directions. <br /> <br /> For the fans of these crazy Italian thrillers, they will appreciate George Hilton and the twists his character takes and what he has overcome. The camera work is fresh with touches of graphic violence and rare, but appropriate options and a good musical score not too exaggerated. The less you know about the story, the better it will be to make it work. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing to prevent this from being a great giallo directed by Sergio Martino is that the story does not have that additional sexual or psychological character. , or both elements to put it above. It is more a routine mystery, the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot, not according to their own virtues and defects. <br /> <br /> The recent release of the DVD (2005) is beautiful and it is definitely the way to see the film, unless there are projections of art houses, which seems unlikely.
