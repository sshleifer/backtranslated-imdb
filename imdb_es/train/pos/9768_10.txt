This is the best movie that was created. It is a masterpiece that made me cry. I will never forget my experience looking at it. I do not understand why people do not think like me. The dinosaur becomes a performance reminiscent of De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator combined. This should be published on DVD in Superbit format so you can fully enjoy it as if it were to be enjoyed when it was produced and filmed. Whoppi Goldberg really becomes a lifelong performer as a tough, corpulent cop who is against his will, joined a hot-shot dinosaur as his partner and then the hi-jinx tells him the least. By the way, I am saying the opposite of what is true, this movie is total trash.
