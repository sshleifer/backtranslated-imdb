How amazing is this movie! I've seen it over and over again over the years and I'm always happy with it. The reason why the film is so easy to see again is, of course, the surprising performance of the young Bette Davis. She not only steals all the scenes she's in, but she's actually much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than in any of the movies she's done so far in her home studio, Warner Brothers (this movie was made by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering makeup and has very attractive hairstyles and, oh, those lovely big eyes (especially, in the restaurant scenes that take place in London's Soho). His body was so curved when he was young. Get a load on the cheap robe you use for your big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And oh boy, she is an absolute power in that scene. Howard is too nervous at all times, but he captures the sensibility of the hero. Frances Dee scores as the sweet and pretty young Sally who really loves him. Max Steiner's score is charming and moving. The splendid performances and the flavor of the thirty make this the indispensable version of the classic novel.
