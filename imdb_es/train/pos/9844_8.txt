['There are very few movies that are as fun as this one. I was lucky enough to see this movie in a theater &quot;reserved&quot; for lovers of films like me, so it was not so embarrassing to be there laughing until my jaw was completely sore and the sleeves of my shirt were all wet from drying out the eyes ... <br /><br /> Sometimes the story was a little &quot;slow&quot;, but maybe it&#39;s the best, a bit of rest between the corridors (I almost fall off the seat ...) was very welcome.']
