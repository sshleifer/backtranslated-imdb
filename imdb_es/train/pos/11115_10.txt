I think The Sopranos is an impressive show due to all the secondary characters that make it up. I've bought all the videos so far and I'm waiting for the rest to come out. In the 42 episodes so far, the best is definitely episode # 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance. This episode is about my favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was amazing because he was actually one of the few characters that really opposed Tony and his gang. In the end, he ended up getting shot in the eye while bathing, and that's my favorite scene in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. And my favorite number 2 character was Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after trying to assassinate Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney Park after they catch him and torture him. My favorite character # 3 is Sean Gismonte, who was killed just after shooting Christopher. And finally, my favorite character # 4 is Chucky Signore, one of Uncle Junior's henchmen. He was killed in a boat by Tony. All the awesome characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about the Sopranos. All the cool guys are always killed. Do you know what would be great to change about the Sopranos? They must have a full episode in which they show all the supporting characters that support death in hell and they all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie, because they need revenge. Brendan Filone will return the blow !!!!!!!!! one
