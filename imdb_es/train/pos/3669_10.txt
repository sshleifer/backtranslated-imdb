This film captures the absurd essence of a dominant American patriot actor, one who believes that his work (and his politics) are as crucial to the American people as the views of the President himself. Alan Bates captures this mentality perfectly as Michael Baytes, and I will immortally remember Bates as this character. This is a movie for Canadians and Americans alike. It is a valuable piece of cinema, which can lead its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal how easy it is for the producer and the director to lose total control of the actors' will and the innumerable external forces . Marvelously, "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the subject it portrays: Peter O'Brian directs with precision and complete control, and directs both the serious "behind the scenes" part of the film and the film within The Movie, "Flight to Bogot√° "with clarity and insight. If you are interested in the ingenuity and strength of Canadian cinema, "Hollywood North" is an excellent place to start.
