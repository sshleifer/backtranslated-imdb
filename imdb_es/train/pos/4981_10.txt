['I feel that this movie is a rare treasure. Not only is the start of the Shirley Temple race, but also a rare way to see how our society has changed. You have to understand, certain things that we would see today as sexual, at that time would be considered innocent. For example, the parents of the children in the film, as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw this only as children who imitated adults. Most people did not think of anyone who saw sexually attractive children, other than adolescents who engaged in adolescence. For them it was not sexual. Keep in mind that this was before we had internet, television, etc. The majority of sexual crimes were not reported openly. From time to time there would be a whisper about the child with the &quot;funny uncle&quot;. But that was often all that came from that. Yes very sad But today it is a bit sad, because even I can also see this movie as something different from what was thought, innocent and fun. When I saw Shirley dance like that and the boys looked at her, yes, I felt disturbed. I have to remind myself of the time this happened! These children did not know what sex was. Parents knew it, both those of the children in the film and those who saw it. The thought may not have even entered their minds. In the eyes of the average adult back then, this was no more sexual than if Shirley was playing at home. Even today, children will participate in the beauty contest, many of them dressed in an extremely mature way, for a three-year-old child. However, the child is simply pretending. I do not blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. Or the old movies that show this. Honestly, our media has made many things seem sick and wrong. This can sometimes be the best. But I really think that this movie is not one of them. It gives a rare look of an innocent mentality, that we have lost a lot of time.']
