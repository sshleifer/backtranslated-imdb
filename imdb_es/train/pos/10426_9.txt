I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that we are all free and that everything is finite. The characters of the firm did not really enjoy their "real" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, that is, what they were. The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only the romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but also about the deeper discussion about their values ​​of life. Many films are like this in terms of discussing the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some type of them. Before Sunrise resolved it in a nice way, which makes the viewer stop, think, adjust your breathing and keep watching the movie. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought in your head. He simply encouraged him to think about some problems of daily life and gave him some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just the typical complaints or the stupid ideas that flow. I would still be thinking about those subjects by yourself and curious about the next story line. The end was not very important after all. You could get something out of that and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. The movies are supposed to be nice. This is a nice movie and it's worth your time to watch it. I am also on a trip. The movie somehow represented a part of me and answered some of my questions.
