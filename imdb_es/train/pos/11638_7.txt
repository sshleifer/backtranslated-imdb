I had fun watching Red Eye. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect on paper. Yes, it's the same old story with a different scenario, but Wes Craven gave it a good rhythm. At least not another scream with the usual university killer. It's nice when you can see a clean and coherent thriller, even when originality does not stand out as its main character. Particularly from a filmmaker like Craven who has brought so many innovative ideas to the genre of suspense and terror in the past and that now only lends itself to take home what could have been a good movie for television if it had not been released theatrically. Good job!
