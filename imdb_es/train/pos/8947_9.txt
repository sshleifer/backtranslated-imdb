Kim Novak is a witch on the lookout for a mortal lover, and James Stewart is his choice. Dazzling comedy of manners, from the Broadway stage; Shot by James Wong Howe in Witch Color, and made by a law distribution. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually disheveled writer Redlitch. I love this movie, although few others seem. Only Kim makes it a winner in my book. Say ah! My movie # 5 of 1958.
