This is definitely one of my favorite Trek episodes. There are so many things in this movie that it's great. First the boys are directed to an alien planet that is about to explode. They meet a strange type of librarian (very well played). Then Kirk manages to transport himself back to what is like the Earth of the sixteenth century. McCoy and Spock try to follow him, but instead they almost freeze in the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years ago. Kirk manages to be locked up and accused of witchcraft, while Spock enjoys a crazy time with a sexy cave girl who was beaten in this horrible world and frozen by a bad guy. <br /> <br /> Spock decides he is happy where he is at and gives McCoy a real daze when the document suggests they need to find a way out. Anyway, everyone finally escapes, leaving behind the poor cave. It takes a lot of conviction before Spock finally gives in and leaves. You can literally savor the sadness in the end. Leaving the cave alone in its icy land seems cruel and truly moving. Spock must have been out of his mind to leave behind his greatest hope of love and being human. Although, in a not so nice neighborhood! <br /> <br /> Anyway, you only have a lot for your money with this episode ... A love story, the witch trials of Salem, Spock as a human, the despair of being left in total isolation. .. abandoned, and three completely different configurations on the alien planet. It's amazing that they managed to put all this into a fifty-minute movie. This is a classic, do not miss it ... I want it on DVD for shure vulcans !!!
