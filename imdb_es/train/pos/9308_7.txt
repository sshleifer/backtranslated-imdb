If you're used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles like Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects, I recommend you take a look at this movie. Even if you're not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular, all the actors in this movie give very good performances. If you have about eleven dollars (about nine pounds) I say you order it online or rent it at your favorite movie rental location. Guaranteed to make you laugh, whether you like gangster movies or not. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies that you never forget, and you find yourself watching again and again. You will talk about it so much that your friends will be borrowing.
