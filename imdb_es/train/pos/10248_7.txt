I first heard of this movie after buying the 1976 movie "Snuff". I was told that the devil's experiment was much better, so, of course, I went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set. I was very interested to know that Charlie Sheen had gone out trying to ban this movie or the second, so my interest was maximum. <br /> <br /> The experiment of the devil is a short film without history, without character development. Only 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways, such as beating her, turning her in circles again and again, forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to high frequency noises for 24 hours, crushing her hand with a mallet, burning and putting worms on. The burns, throwing guts and finally putting a sharp needle in the eye. <br /> <br /> I must say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the scenes of beatings. But then, some of that was really well done in regards to your mockery. The scenes in which the woman is being turned in circles made me dizzy when I saw her. Or the scene in which she is forced to hear sharp noises for 24 hours is painful. The worst is the scene of the eye. I did not do it when I saw it, but I just thought: "Damn it, it looks great for a movie on such a low budget." I enjoyed the movie but I do not know if I can really recommend this unless I have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10
