['I just saw this movie again and I feel dismayed by the amount of cynics who reject her as a New Age pope. A great movie, one that takes time to develop, continues to almost reach the limit but never does and, ultimately, is meditative, affective and more real than most films that people who discard their &quot;coincidences&quot; can watch. At that time I was angry because films like &quot;Prince of Tides&quot; and &quot;Bugsy&quot; (although I liked the latter) were nominated for best film that year (let alone won &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;) and this was completely ignored . With the exception of a nomination for the best script. In reviewing it, I think the story supports my initial reaction!']
