['I consider myself a little knowledgeable about boxing movies and, as such, there is only one thing that prevents me from calling &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; the best boxing film ever made. That&#39;s the Robert Wise / Paul Newman movie &quot;Somebody up there I like it&quot;. That movie could be number 1, but &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; is a number 2 nearby. <br /><br /> The film not only chronicles the rise of James J. Corbett, but also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial turning point. In the late 1800s, boxing moved away from the brutal days of bare knuckle rules to the more &quot;gentlemanly&quot; days of the gloved ones, the rules of the Marquess of Queensbury. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal show and towards a time of acceptance and respectability. <br /><br /> &quot;The Knight Jim&quot; is not a realistic look in those days. It&#39;s romantic and, yes, even a little grumpy at times. But always deliciously. Errol Flynn is perfect as the &quot;gentleman&quot; Jim who really is not a &quot;gentleman&quot; at all, but simply a quick talker of a working-class family. Alexis Smith is pretty dazzling as the upper class woman with whom she has a love / hate relationship (and we all know that it is, of course, love that will win that game at the end). <br /><br /> At the end of &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot;, the great John L Sullivan (whose famous phrase was NOT &quot;I can beat any man in the world&quot;, of course ... again the romanticism) gives his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports movement ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism look in its place &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. That&#39;s a much more realistic boxing movie. But &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; is much more fun.']
