What makes this movie so terrifying is the way he portrays Andre and Calvin as (relatively) normal guys. Definitely, they are not people who want to become professional filmmakers, since they have fun in front of the camera, forget the lines of scripts, etc. They only make the video as a diary to show the "survivors" how normal their lives were. His parents only think that the kids are filming for a family video. When investigating the attacks of other children in their schools, Andre and Calvin learn what they should not do and inform (potentially in a silly way 'This Old House') any potential 'Andres and Calvins' who may be watching this video how to make Bombs, get weapons and do not get caught before Day Zero (the day of the attack).
