The convincing children's classic by Louis Sachar is almost like Disney as Freddy Krueger. It has murder, racism, facial disfigurement and murderous lizards. <br /> <br /> With a well-planned plot, it's a multi-layered and criss-crossing story that spans the story to reveal Stanley's legacy and the secret behind the holes. Run from the lush greenery of Latvia to the Camp Green Lake (track: there is no lake or green). <br /> <br /> The first success of Disney is to recreate the environments of the novel so convincingly: the design of the stage is excellent and without brightness. The other plus is in the casting. The rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Greenlight Project) may not be the fat kid in the book, but her attitude is correct and far from being the usual hero. The rest of the cast completes equally well, from Patricia Arquette as the border school, turned bank robber, to Henry Winkler as Stanley's father. The downside is the pop soundtrack, the pure marketing department, and the feeling to the fullest.
