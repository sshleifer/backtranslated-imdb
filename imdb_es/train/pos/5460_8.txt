Lily Powers works in a clandestine bar until her father dies. Then he goes to New York to work in an office building. There he realizes that if he wants to go higher, he has to give the men what they want. And what men want is her ... well, you know. Alfred E. Green's Baby Face (1933) is a film of high sexual content. For a movie from that era, anyway. This was one of the last Pre-Code films that were made. Barbara Stanwyck offers a very sexy performance like Lily. Other actors in this film include George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henry Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter) and Theresa Harris (Boy). The young John Wayne is seen as Jimmy McCoy Jr. This film is about a brave subject and does it well. Baby Face is a film of historical importance and, therefore, good to see.
