This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships. <br /> <br /> Eventually, they talk, but there is the possibility of changing something about the situation. <br /> <br /> Originally made in Shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai Family. There is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family. History usually has weight in Chinese literature and in serious films. <br /> <br /> A young married couple: Liyan, an invalid, and his wife Yuwen live in an old family complex that is partially ruined. <br /> <br /> A bright contrast is Liyan's young sister who really can not remember the family's past but accepts everything quite naturally. His spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world an unexpected visitor arrives ... <br /> <br /> I ended up feeling rather sad, but definitely a superior movie
