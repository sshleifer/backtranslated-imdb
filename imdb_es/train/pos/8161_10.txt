When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very good. But this movie is not for everyone, especially for people who do not like bloody scenes, since the dentist has many bloody scenes. That's why it has its R18 rating. This is a Beverly Hills dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the man in the pool. It is better to go to the dentist "before" to see this. But if you no longer like going to the dentist, then it is better that you do not see it, since you can stop going for a lifetime. The dentist has the best bloody revenge I've seen. Who has ever seen a movie in which a dentist (Spoiler) pulled all the teeth out of his trap and cut his tongue without anesthesia? Awesome movie in general, but not for everyone.
