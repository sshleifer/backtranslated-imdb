My 10/10 rating is purely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked "Slaughter High" even before you saw it. Yes, it's the typical story of revenge, several years after a dirty joke, but how do you not like some of the things that come out here? I could not have predicted that bathtub scene in a million years. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe we can be cynical and say that this movie does not offer anything new. Well, it does not pretend. It's the kind of movie that "Scream" characters probably saw, and contributed to their rules on how to survive a horror movie. After all, who does not like to see people suffer for doing these things? Obviously, it has a kind of reactionary tone, since people are punished for doing what they defended the 60s. But still, you have to love these things! Then, with apologies to Don McLean, this buffoon did not sing for the king and the queen!
