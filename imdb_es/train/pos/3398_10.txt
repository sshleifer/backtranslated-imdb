I saw Soylent Green in 1973 when it was released for the first time and maybe eight times more in the years on television or video. It was always one of my favorite science fiction movies and / or Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Recently, the Egyptian theater in L.A. He had a retrospective of twelve Charlton Heston films. I flew from out of state to see six of the movies over a period of two days. Soylent Green looked great on the big screen Egyptian with a new perfect impression. It was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a policeman who lives in a world where dogs are eaten, with few natural resources and no understanding of how The world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are great. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks much better on a large 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and the kinematics, the writing, the music used and everything works. The film is also very powerful in its grim and very possible vision of the future. Just think how the world's population grew, the rainforest that disappeared, the resources were exhausted and the greenhouse effect worsened since 1973. I wonder why this movie has not been shown in theaters during all these years. Your reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> Speaking of reputations, people often talk as if Charlton Heston were not a great actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny and Major Dundee, I am convinced that he is one of our best actors. Of course he did a dozen other great movies and for those who care, you know what they are. <br /> <br />
