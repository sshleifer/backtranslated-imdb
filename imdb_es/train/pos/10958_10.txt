This show is so incredibly fun that I could not stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight (even though I've seen all the episodes before). I have always considered Silverman as a great talent and this is finally a vehicle for a broad audience to enjoy that talent. I see this program and I laugh a great percentage of the time ... I can not say that about many TV shows ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting and (most importantly) fun! This is a program that I will never miss and that I will buy on DVD as soon as it comes out. You owe it to yourself to see this program ... I predict a long term for this series ... And to be clear, people who feel offended by this program simply do not understand it ... maybe they lack the intelligence to understand ... they should stop making a fool of themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "intolerant" in reference to Silverman, or who says that he only intends to "scandalize" ... is out of place ... She is exactly the opposite; simply look for it and you will quickly see that it is a great defender of civil rights, etc. If you do not know that you are ironically accepting all these outrageous views, you do not understand. And if you do not get it, do us a favor to the rest of us and shut up so we can all enjoy the hilarity ...
