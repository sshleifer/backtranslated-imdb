Dark Remains is a simple and simple home run. The film is full of spooky and frightening images that will make the most experienced horror veteran jump out of the seat. The staircase scene in particular, these guys are good. Although they were not working on a big budget, everything looks good, and the actors get it. Dark Remains has one of those interpretive endings that can be negative for some, but I guess that makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are fashionable, since the afflicted couple that tries to rebuild their lives live, however, some secondary characters like the Sheriff did not convince me. They are not that important anyway. I give Dark Remains a perfect score of ten for being ten times more terrifying than any recent history of Japanese studio / remake ghosts.
