This movie was absolutely brilliant. It actually made me think. Throughout the film I was confused as hell. I loved everything about it ... it was so confusing and so twisted and weird, it was hard not to love it. All the actors were phenomenal, and nobody could have done a better job ... This is one of my favorites of the year ... it deserves an ocar.
