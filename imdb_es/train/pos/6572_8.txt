One of my favorite movies for several years was "Last Action Hero"; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to ruin my fun by becoming a corrupt politician; so now I can not stand any film in which I can participate. <br /> <br /> The adventures of Jake Speed ​​are actually toys with themes similar to those of Last ... Hero; so I was pleased to find it on DVD, so I could see these songs so well interpreted. <br /> <br /> Despite the "plot within the plot" related to white slavery during the civil war of an African nation, this is not an action movie. The plot in which is the "plot within a plot", actually is about a question that the film does not intend to solve: Is Jake Speed ​​a real person who is helping the heroine to save her sister of the white slave trader? ; Or is it really a fictional character (which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels)? I suggest that this is not so clearly defined in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are perfectly aware of this. The film thus becomes a presentation of what the public may want from such a fictional universe of "adventure stories". Actually, it is a rich subject, whose potential heaviness is lightened by the friendly and cordial sense of humor of the film. <br /> <br /> The film has weaknesses, mainly its cinematography, which makes the film look like a television. show. And the rhythm gives way from time to time. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters, and I enjoy the adventure they live, even if it's silly. And I find fascinating the idea that this adventure is taking place in a novel. <br /> <br /> It is sustained in multiple presentations: a good show!
