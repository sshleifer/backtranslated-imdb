['Usually, when we use the word &quot;escapist,&quot; we say it negatively; The big screen version of Warren Beatty&#39;s &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; proves that &quot;escapist&quot; can be good. This is truly an entertaining movie. Like the title character of the same name, dressed in yellow and intrepid, Beatty creates a detective with whom we can all relate: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses. <br /><br /> From there, the rest of the characters are almost a world in themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one would expect her to be the husband of any crime fighter; Breathless, Mahoney (Madonna) is possibly the most disconcerting person you can imagine; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but great. Other characters include Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman) with voice problems, 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin), and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O&#39;Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also star. <br /><br /> Oh, wait a minute. I have not even explained the plot! The plot involves Tracy trying, and failing so far, to find a way to catch Big Boy. Simultaneously, some very strange events have been happening in the city, whose answers may or may not be closer than everyone thinks. <br /><br /> Of course, the main thing about this movie is that it&#39;s fun to watch it. If Warren Beatty was having trouble acting his age, then he made good use of that here. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is a great movie.']
