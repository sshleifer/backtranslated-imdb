When I first saw the title, I was already deducting the subject of the film, which clearly was not a reference to the British currency, so it had to be Shakespearian and around pounds of meat, take them or give them. Will Smith is a good actor, so the serial killers were out. It could only be a man who gives them, so it must be guilt in some way. I spoiled the whole thing by looking at it and knowing the story before I saw it, since the beauty of accumulation is the way the main character's background parts are drip-fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who It is and why it is doing what it is doing. <br /> <br /> Blame is a very difficult subject to do simply because it is deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are waiting for a roller coaster. You know it's going to be unpleasant. I would not say that the movie glorifies suicide; it goes into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice: martyrdom. <br /> <br /> It is also full of symbolism everywhere, which is a clear sign that writing is ingeniously thought out in great detail and leading to multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature. The most prominent issue that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but that he was also giving it physically as the best gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is frustrated by falling in love, which is a complication of second act. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's very slow, but I'm hesitant as to whether it would have been better fitted in a smaller period of time. I did not feel the tension and its terrible internal agitation as much as I could have, but maybe I just ruined it by myself beforehand. However, all this being said, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and stimulating tragedy that deserves the prizes it will inevitably receive.
