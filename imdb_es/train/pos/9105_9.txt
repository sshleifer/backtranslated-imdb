Women have never looked as attractive and pathetic as in Salazar's film, Piedras. Although the editors here and there can help the film, it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense brand of Pedro Almod贸var's latest films. 5 different women are dealing with their male partners and their families. Beginning with several different stories that are going to meet as the plot progresses, Salazar portrays his female characters in the same neurotic and edge-line behavior that is familiar to Almod贸var. A kleptomaniac high society lady with fat shoes to smaller ones, a burlesque lady of the house taking care of her disabled daughter, a dancer addicted to drugs obsessed with her ex-boyfriend and a taxi driver who cares for the disturbed children of his deceased husband, all wandering the streets of Madrid in well-designed scenes. Using some of Almod贸var's family actresses, the director succeeds in his first film to give depth to all the characters who share the film and create genuine sympathy with each of them. Women control the plot, and men are required to stay together, eventually ... Surprisingly good for a first movie, and worth the time at any standard. It is notable that Salazar doubted some necessary guidelines for the actresses, but in any case an impressive act is shown on the screen, especially by Monica Cervera, who acted in her previous short film. <br /> <br /> An obligation for everyone. Almod贸var fans, and enjoyable for everyone.
