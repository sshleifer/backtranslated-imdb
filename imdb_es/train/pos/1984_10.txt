One of the best musicals done, one that is timeless and worth seeing again and again. Delicious! The performance, especially by Ron Moody as Fagin, is excellent. The costumes are exquisite ... even those in disrepair. <br /> <br /> The two young boys who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are wonderfully talented. Oliver Reed does a great job representing Bill Sykes in a place where you can not help but expect him to reach a terrible ending ... what he does. <br /> <br /> The dance is intelligently choreographed and fascinating. Oliver can defend himself with characters like My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. A movie for the whole family.
