They had me from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A small place similar to Mayberry with a slight difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There is the spoiler. It's not as if you had not discovered it in 10 minutes anyway. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people are trying to keep it well, but it's an uphill battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. Subtle. Furtive. He does not always come as evil. Most of the time he is a hero. Everyone owes him a great favor, because he often creates a calamity and saves it from her. So every time you think someone will finally bring it down, one of your friends will come out of nowhere to sabotage it. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to steal them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson about evil. <br /> <br /> The thief (Ted) hesitated to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half a conscience. If I had no conscience, I would have shot them. If he had a true conscience, he would never have become a criminal. So he started calling it Half-Ted. It was quite fun. He was mocking the criminals. And, of course, he stayed 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted at all times. And, of course, he was in complete control at all times. They really made you favor Satan. <br /> <br /> Very, very excellent show. It was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of fear American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> It's a good company.
