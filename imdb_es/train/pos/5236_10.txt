This stylistically sophisticated visual game presents "a story within a story". The protagonist is the screenwriter Bart Klever who persistently fights with his new text? which is, at the same time, the script of the movie we are watching. In the film, Bart plays a screenwriter who writes the script of the film? Bart's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme, as does the environment of the apartment where he works and takes care of his little girl. The intimate environment offers ample opportunities for games of illusion that involve space, light, colors and a pair of cats. The externally simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the interventions of the filmmaker, which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the mutable environment of similarity. The constantly changing angle of vision complicates the answers to the questions that arise: What is truth and what is illusion? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest? Can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space?
