I was puzzled by why damn FOX canceled season3, although season2 was not as good as season1, which is really excellent. I like it so much that I'm even thinking about buying a DVD on Amazon. (Failed! Student and it is inconvenient for me to obtain an international credit card and $). I hope that FOX can give DA back some day in some way!
