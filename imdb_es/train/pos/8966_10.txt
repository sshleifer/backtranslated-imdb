This is a wonderful movie, it makes the 1950s look beautifully elegant. Kim Novak is intriguing and convincing as a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All the supporting performances are spectacular, from Jack Lemmon as Nicky, his annoying, to Ernie Kovacs, author of Magic in Mexico, who works in Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as the witch and Aunt Queenie. And then there is the cat. I have no idea how many witches (besides me) have named a Pyewacket cat, but they suggest a million and a half. Jmes Stewart seems out of place, but as much as his character is offside in this strange underworld of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And it has the perfect romantic happy ending, in which we believe because the films of this vintage have such happy endings. Gillian and Shep certainly have as many chances to be happy as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen (another great movie)
