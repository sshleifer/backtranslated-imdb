Season after season, the players or characters in this show seem to be people you'd love to hate. Is this show prepared to be that or were they chosen for it? Each episode specifically defames a single person and ends up being killed. You enjoy watching them fucked even if it is totally bad and sick. You enjoy seeing them fucking others, getting them drunk, playing dirty, recovering, escaping and finally being expelled by Trump. The amount of tears also seems to be increasing with the season. <br /> <br /> The rewards that try to compensate for the humiliation and suffering of the past are also greatly reduced. In the newer seasons, it's like "You have the opportunity to meet xyx who will give you a lecture about uvw" ... who cares? The characters are so comfortable, collective and individual, that you wonder if they are paid actors. The only healthy can win. <br /> <br /> Watch carefully and maintain awareness. These are your fellows in the line of fire.
