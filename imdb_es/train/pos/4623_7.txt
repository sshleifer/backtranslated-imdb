Despite its pretty salacious title, this is a light teen drama. Unless you're an old fool, you'll probably find it nice. However, it is not so good to develop characters or situations without problems. When you see it, you have the feeling that you have been running from one side of the kitchen to the other, even if you have been sitting watching all the time. This is one of those movies that counts a lot with your taste for the characters, and they are attractive enough. Jennifer Connelly is the heartthrob of many people, I know, but I've always liked Maddie Corman, who is darker. Teenagers get most of the time on screen without many intrusions of those annoying adults. Is it just me or do most young males look very similar?
