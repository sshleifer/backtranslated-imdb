An excessive but convincing account of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest where we see the link formed between the two men, and how they help each other, but the second half is not as strong, due to the elimination of the character Biko. Still, it is a compelling film with great performances by Kline and Washington, in the film that put the latter on the map. Washington was also nominated for best supporting actor for the first time. In general, a well-made movie that could have been cropped a bit. 7/10 .____________________________________
