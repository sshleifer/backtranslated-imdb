The first time I saw this movie was about 4 years ago and I expected something fun, similar to CB4. I was amazed. I was on the floor laughing at my ass, this movie is great. Much better than CB4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything. Siskel and Egbert gave the first-rate independent film "Two Thumbs UP" (and if two old white guys can understand the humor in this movie, they know it's good).
