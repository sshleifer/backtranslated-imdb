"Jake Speed" is a good movie with a wonderful message. It has its flaws, of course. Sometimes it's a bit slow Introduce your villain too far into the story. Its action develops at the speed of the heartbeat of a snail. It has a Z-grade cast (although I've always admired the work of Karen Kopins, who looks like Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But with all this goes against "Jake Speed" is really inspiring, thanks to a lovely script by Wayne Crawford (who plays the lead role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why do I find it so inspiring? Because he says "Hey, why do not you try to be a good person?" <br /> <br /> The story is essentially a "strange in a strange land" premise, which is good and heroic. Jake's speed is located in the real world where good things happen to good people. Jake is more than a Boy Scout. He is more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, evil and evil world. <br /> <br /> This is why "Jake Speed" really needed to be a success. It has a great message that should have reached Hollywood and then the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that really tried to portray good and decent people. I'm not saying we should be seeing the Waltons in all the cineplex theaters, but it would be nice if more movies like "Jake Speed" had a chance. ("Due South," a television show about a Canadian Mountie, is a good comparison of what can be done to encourage American entertainment.) <br /> <br /> Sure, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and weapons. But the general message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person, you will always defeat the forces of evil. 10/14/99
