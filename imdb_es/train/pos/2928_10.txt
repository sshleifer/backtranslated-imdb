EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is easily the funniest concert movie I've ever seen. Most standing acts usually have moments of calm at some point, but not these people. For 90 minutes there is not a moment that is not so fun. From the moment Eddie makes a hilariously dead impression of Mr.T, the laughter is endless. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was done in 1983, and Eddie has not done anything so much fun. It's amazing that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a movie called HARLEM NIGHTS that was not very funny at all. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you're out there, please come back and give a concert. DELIRIOUS vein film. Believe me your fans will love you for that. And I think you know.
