"The purple color" is really amazing. There is none like it, and I think there never will be. It is a roller game of emotion and pain that the spectator assumes. The actors are impeccable and the direction is excellent. Absolutely loved it. A movie has never made me so happy. It's beautiful, that's the best way to explain it.
