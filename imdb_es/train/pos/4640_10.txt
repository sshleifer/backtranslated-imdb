It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last 2 years (I've seen the premiere in Tel-Aviv, Israel, in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war began ...) This problem in communication between people , which causes wars, I am interested for a long time, and it does not matter who, boys and girls, heterosexuals and gays, Jews and Arabs ... I have already seen the bubble 3 times, and still surprising and exciting for me: each character It reminds me of one of the many people I know, and the difference between them, as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw him was with my friend, who is a Christian Arab. , and it was on Israel's independence day (the most symbolic I could! How ironic) and ... at the end he cried! - If he was touched and he was not ashamed - The Bubble would touch everyone!
