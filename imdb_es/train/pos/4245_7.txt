If The Girl From Missouri songs sound familiar, you should. That's because Anita Loos, who wrote the script here, also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in that movie, Jean Harlow will accept any type of men's jewelry with resources. <br /> <br /> And they are media men that Jean Harlow is looking for. She leaves the hashish house on the side of the road, led by her mother and her stepfather, because she has decided that the best way to earn an easy life is to marry her. Her talents as a showgirl are limited, but she will be able to exchange that beauty. <br /> <br /> Her odyssey begins when she and her friend Patsy Kelly receive an invitation to perform at a party organized by a millionaire. Lewis Stone But without Jean's knowledge, Stone is having one last wild adventure before making himself for the money that does not belong to him. Still, she snatches some ornaments that warns Lionel Barrymore, a fellow millionaire. <br /> <br /> Lionel has fun until Jean sets his sights on his playboy son, Franchot Tone. After that, he does not have fun and tries to prevent Jean from getting into the family tree. <br /> <br /> The Missouri Girl went into production in the middle of the adaptation of The Code, for which she was subjected to a peculiar censorship. I have the feeling that we would have seen a much riskier movie. Jean Harlow is still always appreciated as a younger and sassier version of Mae West. What a great comedic talent that woman had, seeing The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss that the movie world suffered with his death three years later. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the cast of Patsy Kelly with Undoubtedly, Harlow was influenced by the successful shorts that Kelly was doing with another famous platinum blonde, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry that Patsy had with Thelma. Todd would also die a year later in a strange accident / suicide / homicide that has never been satisfactorily explained. <br /> <br /> Do not miss The Girl From Missouri, it's bright and daring, it must be of all those brilliant jewels.
