['I was very surprised with this movie. Entering the preview, not knowing anything about the movie, except the only trailer I had seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where&#39;s My Car party. I expected jokes, sexual jokes and a pathetic protagonist at the end, because that&#39;s how movies work. Instead, I got a clever and surprisingly original movie about a decent average guy who never had sex. <br /><br /> Yes, the movie is full of jokes about sex, vulgarity and, occasionally, hey-look-a-nipple, but it&#39;s done a lot in the spirit of Bad Santa instead of Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeeming friends who are only trying to connect a brother and live their lives. <br /><br /> I started to think that this movie was going to be total shit, and it surprised me a lot. Yes, it&#39;s quite exaggerated (come on, it&#39;s a movie about a 40-year-old virgin!), But it&#39;s very well made. <br /><br /> In the end, you&#39;re really trying to get this guy to go to bed, which says a lot about the movie because, honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?']
