['&quot;Love in the time of money&quot; by Petter Mattei is a visually stunning movie to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrayal of human relationships. This is a movie that seems to tell us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we find ourselves. <br /><br /> This being a variation of the work of Arthur Schnitzler on the same subject, the director transfers the action to the present in New York, where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way or another to the next person, but nobody seems to know the previous point of contact. With style, the film has a sophisticated and luxurious look. They take us to see how these people live and the world in which they live in their own habitat. <br /><br /> The only thing that is obtained from all these souls in the image are the different stages of the solitude that each one inhabits. A great city is not exactly the best place where human relationships find a sincere realization, as can be discerned, is the case of most of the people we meet. <br /><br /> The acting is good under the direction of Mr. Mattei. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive. <br /><br /> We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and look forward to his next job.']
