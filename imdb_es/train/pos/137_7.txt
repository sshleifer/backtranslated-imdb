After some of the negative reviews I heard in this movie, I was hesitant to try it, but I had Â£ 3.99 in my wallet and thought it was a bet to buy a budget like a movie, I saw this and I did and I did. I'm glad I did it, I enjoyed it. Directed by The Star of movies like Chain Reaction, The Ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cox) I had to bet with this, even if it was nonsense, but it was not at all, I found some pretty funny humor, especially Alfred Molina the star of Spider-man 2 the Character Doc Ock. The nicest part of the movie was excellent. Of course, like many other people who bought this movie, I saw Matthew's name, and that made me understand it! and not his part is not big at all, it is very short at the end of the movie, it is not an important part what makes me believe that is why people hate the movie. I suggest you try. Some parts are a poor pit that needed polishing, acting and a little more action. But it is observable.
