Although he is not as famous as some of his other collaborations (like THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a dandy horror movie although the casting decisions were a bit strange. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a strange scientist who lives in the mountains of the Carpathians, near the hometown of Dracula's character. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet, whose nationality was never discussed, although the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would make sense to have two roles of change, since the role of the Carpathians seems tailor made for Lugosi, especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual turn, the two still did excellent jobs. Karloff was definitely the lead role, but Lugosi absolved himself as a relatively normal person, something he did not play very often in movies! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit outcast, since other scientists (especially Benet) think that their theories are strange and meaningless. However, in the course of the film, Rukh is right and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Rukh. But, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered has the unpleasant side effect of turning it into a crazy killing machine (do not you hate it when that happens?). While this could have been a simple pleasant scientist, the story went crazy, the plot was well constructed, the characters were very well developed and the crazy Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional murderer, but complex and interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant to be enjoyed by anyone, except for people who hate old horror movies. It can really be said that Universal Pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger budget film instead of the cheap fasties that Lugosi and Karloff gravitated unfortunately in later years. Good material.
