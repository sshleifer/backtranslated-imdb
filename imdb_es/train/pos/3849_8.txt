This latest Verhooven-speaking Dutch movie made me laugh well. As a movie buff looking for all the little details and cross references, etc. In any movie, I can assure anyone interested in the art of cinema that this piece entertains all the senses. I have not read the book by Gerard Reves, on which the film is based, but I still believe that we get a sincere image of a somewhat cocky poet / writer who gets his (in a way, it is not spoiled here). An antihero surrounded by characters who have ambiguous intentions, like him. All this in a magnificently packaged cinematography, Paul Verhopven manages to turn the Dutch places "gesellich (?)" Otherwise pretty cute in a suspense scene, cinema, an awesome job!
