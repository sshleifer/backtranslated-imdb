A few days ago I realized that the creators of this movie put a play on words in their title. This film is not primarily about the act of the "giants of riding", but especially of the people who are the giants of sport, the giants of RIDING, to change the emphasis. <br /> <br /> In my adolescence I lived a block from the Wedge, one of the most successful and best places for surfing in the world. I have surfed 15 to 18 feet, and I have ridden and hit with waves of 10 and 12 feet many times. That experience is the reason why I am in total amazement of the surfers in this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, in all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with Maverick's BY HIMSELF for more than a decade is beyond my reach. The first safety rule of any water sport is "Never surf / dive / swim alone". It was where healthy people would not, and he lived to tell it. I would not go there if the water were at 75 degrees and all the sharks left. <br /> <br /> In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves in Jaws always makes the skin shudder all over my body. These are not just waves of fear, they are uncontrolled bowel evacuation waves. When we see that Laird Hamilton not only survives with waves of 40 to 60 feet (I can hardly write those numbers), but actually, I think a day of fun in Rincon surprises me. There is a dedication and focus on big wave riders that is comparable to that of anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave him a 9 instead of a 10 just because he forgets to mention that there are great big wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama team, and I think they deserve a mention. Splice into Ken Bradshaw in the exterior log cabins and a 10 is!
