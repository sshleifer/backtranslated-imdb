I found it a very entertaining movie for young children that is actually more designed for adults with lots of jokes and humor that only they would understand. Some things are inappropriate for children, but only some. On the other hand, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) makes so many jokes that you can not keep up with them all, from the sexual to the cultural to the most intimate of Hollywood and the racial. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and it looks great on DVD. The girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairstyles of the little people here are fun to watch. The voice of Anthony Hopkins is also pleasant, so telling his story raises the film even more. It's fun to listen to their rhymes. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater, although it was "fair", but on DVD it was much better. I've seen it three times and it got better each time.
