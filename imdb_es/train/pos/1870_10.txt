This movie is great! He touched my heart of cold stone. I could not relate to the racial discrimination that Antwone has experienced because I live in my own country. I think it's really hard to be discriminated against. <br /> <br /> We saw this film in our sociology class at the New Age University, and I did not know it was a real story, I thought it was created by an intellectual who wants to give the industry a fresh air. Is very good. <br /> <br /> The part that surprised me was when Nadine sexually abused Antwone (who was only six years old). If he were in his shoes, he could have jumped a ten-story building. I greet you for being so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that moved me here is when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face to face. He did not bother her or anything, instead, she told him about the achievements she made in the long years when they separated. (I think I will when I have the opportunity to trace my roots).
