I just watched the film two days ago, and it filled me with expectation, since Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and I spent 18 very romantic months there in the 80s. I was a little disappointed that most of this group of vignettes, Although original and artistically made, they do not capture the "light" and beauty of the city very well. Romance is not enough! We did not see any of the wooded boulevards ... There was too much darkness, not only literally but also figuratively. Some of the frames manipulated the viewer that it seemed, and left it "flat" (the sequence of Marais, the sequence of hair vendor, to give two examples). The edifying, good: the sequence of Mime, the cemetery, Montmartre (although it was too much for the viewer to understand), the vignette of the "Cowboy" and the Sacre Coeur ... seemed few and distant, and would have liked to have I saw an actor as wonderful as Orlando Bloom being in something that would have shown more its originality.
