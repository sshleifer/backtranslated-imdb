A sweet little movie that would not even offend your grandmother, "Saving Grace" seems taken from the same canvas as half a dozen other British comedies in the last two years ... the loser faces adversity, finds the strength to Challenge and Learn something about yourself in the process. <br /> <br /> Widowed and therefore broken, Grace is a master gardener, and is recruited to help her friend / employee Matthew grow his pot plant. He has been doing everything wrong, so Grace helps him. They realize that she is the perfect person to harvest the pot, of which both can benefit. She likes to smoke, she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage. <br /> <br /> Highlight is Grace who travels to London to sell part of her merchandise, dressed in what looks like the white suit that John Travolta wore on "Saturday Night Fever" and, therefore, stick out like a thumb sore <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always visible, and you can not say that about a lot of people ... well, I can not, anyway. Ferguson is very good, and Tcheky Karyo, who I liked in "La Femme Nikita", is memorable. <br /> <br /> Not deeply moving or insightful, but immensely entertaining, and in about 90 energetic minutes, it feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.
