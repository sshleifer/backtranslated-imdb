Pandro S. Berman was "in charge of production", but that turned him into the so-called Line Producer. But who produced this epic, filmed not in Arizona but in the Mohave Desert in California, where the scavengers have escaped with all the remains of the "Golden Temple", the Thuggee huts, the British outpost in Muri, the village from Tantrapur, etc. Minor technical failures can and should be forgiven. What is unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for the best music, although perhaps the Academy did not offer it at that time. A unique theme was played in several tempos, such as waltz, march and sweet, atmosphere. Sparkly! One of the curious aspects of the production was the demands of the widow Kipling. An actor who plays Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. In the initial release his scenes were cut, according to the demands of Mrs. Kipling. Later they were included and lent a "connection" from Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's script. Interestingly, this very typical and pro British story was written by a great screenwriter who hated the British.
