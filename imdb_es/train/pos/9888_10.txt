['Although this beautiful work of art uses part of the cinematographic vocabulary of Surrealism, in reality it is nothing like that. It is a political and cultural allegory of the post-Columbian odyssey of Mexico, as attested even by a passing glance at the history of Mexico. <br /><br /> Unlike &quot;I like water for chocolate&quot;, &quot;Erendira&quot; expects the viewer to find it at least in half, so understanding it requires a bit of work. (A good starting point is to see the character of the grandmother as Spain: proud, distant, sad and, above all, loaded with history). <br /><br /> The final actions of the heroine are obscure because the &quot;result&quot; of the story (ie, the present) is always obscure, since we are too close for an honest evaluation. The refusal to carefully tie the loose ends is the only real option available to the director, given the ambitions of the film. <br /><br /> &quot;Erendira&quot; is beautiful. A large screen experience would be ideal if you can see it at an art exhibition or local university. But if not, VHS is better than ever to see it at all.']
