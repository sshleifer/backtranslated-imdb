Great Woody Allen? No. Well Woody Allen? Insurance. I found myself, along with the audience I attended, laughing out loud and, often, with some of the best Woody Allen phrases we've heard in a long time.

She certainly made Woody's dialogue much better than the young cast of her latest comedy, Melinda / Melinda.
