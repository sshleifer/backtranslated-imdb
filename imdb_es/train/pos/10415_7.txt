Three flash-backs introduce the main characters (Abu, Jaffar and the Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; There are three songs, each linked to those same characters. On three occasions, Ahmad utters the absolute word 'Time', in his declaration of love for the princess, answering his three questions in his first of the three meetings. So strong is the impression that it causes, that the princess will resist the three attempts of Jaffar to conquer it, by means of three successive tricks: deceit, hypnosis and erasure of the memory. However, Jaffar possesses what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip, the power and the sword. Three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical horse, the genius, and the genius and the magic carpet. The Genie offers three wishes to Abu in his first of three meetings; Three times the Genie laughs out loud in the gorges of the mountain, and three are his considerations on human frailty, before he leaves. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards, giant spiders and giant octopi). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future, the magic carpet that transports him just in time to save Ahmad and the princess, and the bow and arrow to execute Jaffar. There is magic in number three, and there is magic in this movie.
