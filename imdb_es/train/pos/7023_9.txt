I loved that this film recognizes the intelligence of the viewer, allowing the layers to detach from the characters through their interactions with each other about the tacit loss that has affected so much each one of them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is beautiful, and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone who I think is a new extremely talented filmmaker with the maturity and artistic vision to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed. comply. I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who had the ability to focus on a goal and achieve it with integrity. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on this achievement.
