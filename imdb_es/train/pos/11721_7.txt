The magnetism radiated by Elvira, which attracts her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her long and well toned figure, her big bust, her innocuously naughty attitude and her bag lexicon of the valley slang generation, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is clear that Elvira's person has certain archetypal elements that help make the character more than the sum of his simple sentences and big chest. As initiated by the way the village children react to it, it represents the deep teen fantasy for an experienced woman who can connect with them from her level: a strange mix of romantic one-dimensional longing, childish sexual cravings and the desire to a casual and carefree fun. She symbolizes an underdeveloped ideal of femininity perfected for children and a source of strength for the girls of the city. The other adults have problems with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, your film can not ignore its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak it is for her talents. Almost everything is adapted to the mentality of a teenager and, although it is a direct comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person can enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have such skill and I found that the movie is a charming delight. <br /> <br /> The best quote: Bob Redding: How is your head? Elvira: I have not had any complaints.
