I was never a big fan of television until I saw 24 for the first time. I got into the series very late. Season 5 ended before I saw my first episode. It was an episode of the 3 Series that was in the DVR box (digital video recorder) of my parents while I was at home sitting over the weekend. It took me that one episode to connect me and immerse myself in the world of Jack Bauer. And boy was hooked !! I watched the next six episodes without blinking. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited one-month pass for twenty dollars and needless to say it was the biggest money I ever spent. I saw the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 episodes of forty minutes! I will say that finding out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting a whole week. I can only imagine the anticipation of watching Season 6 week to week !! I find it slightly tortuous and cruel, but I will try it and I will see it just like the rest of the United States. The DVR is ready and you can bet I'll be nibbling the bit!
