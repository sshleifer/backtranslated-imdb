['Having not seen the film in the original film premiere, I was pleasantly surprised when the DVD arrived, as this film did not have the wide distribution it deserved. <br /><br /> The directorial debut of Denzel Washington and the final product have nothing to envy to other films on the same subject of more expert directors. The movie looks very professional. This shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot by being on the other side of the camera. He brings a different angle to this movie. <br /><br /> One of the best things about the film is, without a doubt, the excellent performance of Derek Luke. He is an actor who, with the right guidance, will go far, no doubt. His opinion about the young man with problems, in this moment of his life, in the confusion and suffering for a bad hand of life, until now, he has tried, is very true. His Antwone is a good portrait of a man with pain that is basically very good and has a lot to give, but nobody seems to see that side of his character. <br /><br /> At the worst moment of his desperation, Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very sober, if somewhat moderate, manner. Due to the anguish within Antwone, he loses the opportunity to open up to this man, who wants to help, but due to the restrictions imposed in his office, he only has three sessions and then he has to dismiss his patient. <br /><br /> Things work, since Antwone can convince the doctor to continue working with him. Antwone&#39;s past is revealed in detail. The abuse he suffers at the hands of Mrs. Tate, his adoptive mother, is brutal, to say the least. The attempt on the part of an older woman in Tate&#39;s house of sexual abuse, gives Antwone a bitter taste that remains with him throughout his adult life, as it has been marked by the shame it carries. <br /><br /> Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to make her see a different world because of her love and the support she gives him. <br /><br /> The main performances are very good indeed. Dr. Davenport of Denzel Washington also has his own problems. Nor is he a happy camper. He can help Antwone, but he can not help himself or his relationship with a wife who adores him. <br /><br /> The talent in the movie is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a good Cheryl. Novella Nelson, who is a good actress, is excellent like Mrs. Tate, the abusive adoptive mother. <br /><br /> Antwone&#39;s reunion with his unknown family is too sugary and sentimental, but, of course, if one believes that Fisher finds happiness at last, he also has to accept that part of the film.']
