My brief comment for this film is to go pick it up. Most likely, you will be positively surprised by a diversity of elements that will be explored excellently in this criminal thriller. There is no way that the character of Miklos, claiming and pressing for space in all possible ways, does not push his nerves to the limit ... 2 thumbs up!
