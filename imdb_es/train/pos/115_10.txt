Subtle art piece. Maybe a masterpiece. No doubt a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Kafka-style story about the impossibility of victory or survival in a perpetual and strange world. Life is, in this film, the only adaptation exercise. Lesson on the limits and the original sin, on the fragility of the innocence and the error of its ways. <br /> <br /> Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and the same ambiguous woman. And Europe is a symbol of the basic crisis that has many aspects such as chimerical wars or futile search for truth / essence / golden age. <br /> <br /> Metaphor or parabola, the film is a story of the evolution of disappointment. War, peace, business or lies are just gelatin-time details. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love- a convention. The only method of sacrifice to hope to understand a painful reality.
