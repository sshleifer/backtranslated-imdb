['When a manager of an orphanage goes on vacation, his father takes over the details of the center and ends up renting the children. When a wealthy person became a couple with a nice apartment and a great life, he had the idea of adopting this idea tailored for them. Why would they want to ruin their elegant existence with a trio of carpet vines with braided hair? In no way do people like these two need children to make wonderful life. This movie makes it look like the real world works this way, but I am the image of doubt.']
