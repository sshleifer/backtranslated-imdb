['Although Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the games in the series, it is still a classic and is as good as the old games. Games with this repetition value are few and far between. In addition, this game has a lot of variety. There are 15 levels, each with several different tasks that you can do, and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but its lack of challenge does not take anything away from the game. Once you have overcome it, you will want to erase your game and start over. And it&#39;s just as fun the second time, the third time or the hundredth time. A must be owned by any owner of Nintendo 64, and is a reason in itself to own a Nintendo 64.']
