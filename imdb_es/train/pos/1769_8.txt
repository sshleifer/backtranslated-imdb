He just came out of a preview of this movie. It made me laugh every 30 seconds. The ending was so funny that the tears rolled down my face and I wished I had not bought that big coca. There are definitely some moments of calm, but, in general, very entertaining. The film allows Steve Carell to have the opportunity to shine after stealing attention from both Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in his films. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and that he continues to work in independent dramas (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should be getting more work, because he's so talented and attractive. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly fun times. I recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you are easily offended, do not watch this movie. If you are a rabid feminist, do not watch this movie. And, please, no matter what, even if you think you are one of those "modern" parents, do not take your children to this movie. Of course, you should let your teenagers watch this movie, but do not watch it with them. I would do for some incredibly uncomfortable moments.
