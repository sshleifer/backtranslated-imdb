If this were an American movie, I would rate it as 7: we've seen it before. This being an Argentine movie, and being Argentina myself, I would like to give it a 10, since it is the kind of quality I had been waiting for, instead of waiting. It's excellent the quality is amazing, given all the limitations imposed by the Third World ... <br /> <br /> I can not forget the scene in which Diaz forces Silverstein's fiancé to confess: you know what I mean if you see the movie. I think that is the key moment of the film, perhaps not surprising, but original. That's when the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching a movie, I always try to gather previous information. Being a commercial, satirical, commercial, press "Play" and make a suspension of reality and logic, I would say that it is the best mood to enjoy movies like this. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, however, it is credible in a certain way. As for me, I could not stop laughing with every joke and comment - "you're bad" ("you're bad") ... put it in Diaz's mouth, the biggest one. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty tired of watching movies "designed for" Peretti. I know he is an excellent actor, but sometimes I feel that his papers are opaque to the rest, the role of Luis Luque in this case. I do not really like Argentine TV, so I have not seen much of Luque's work, but it's quite obvious that he's an excellent interpreter. His physical role, his fixed looks, his attitude of content in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role should need some improvements, just to show us how good it can be! <br /> <br /> I do not know if Szifrón is planning to make a sequel or not. I know he will not succeed if it is to follow the rule that "the second parts were never good", so if he does, I will surely go to see him. And I hope that, in the future, consider the possibility of giving Peretti's counterparts the same opportunities to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> A great movie, great performances and lots of laughs!
