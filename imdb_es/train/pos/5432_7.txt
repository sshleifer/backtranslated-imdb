.... Rather well done, actually - attack the evil villains in your lair, stop an ambush in the style of Little Big Horn, save the day through the bother of the waterboys, it works for me. Rigid upper British lip and all that. <br /> <br /> So, how does it play on a DVD 66 years later? It hit me like I was a Western Apache or Sioux for the Thugs, and the United States Cavalry for the Imperial British Army. It's very colonial in its perspective, you know? The white man's burden and all that? Kipling would certainly have approved. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen play it as widely as possible, putting some friends friends slapstick in the mix between shootings and fights, just in case. (I had no idea that Joan Fontaine was the wife of the army of chips - did they leave some of her scenes on the floor of the cutting room? Very short-) None of them aspired to an Oscar here; in fact, Grant was not in the best of himself in a few scenes, but, deep down, it still works. And where else would Ben Casey end up as an Indian howler? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Def. Look at this if you like adventures and mischief pseudo-Western style. It was done by a group of professionals, I might as well add. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
