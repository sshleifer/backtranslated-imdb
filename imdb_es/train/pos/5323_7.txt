['There are a number of things that are not correct, although this is not too important since what happened to whom and when is still in dispute. I think the most blatant freedom with the facts is when they start playing in Bruno Koschmidder&#39;s Kaiserkeller, when in fact they played in Indra and then they moved to the Kaiserkeller. <br /><br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was predisposed in favor of Pete Best&#39;s version, but if he is the story&#39;s adviser, I guess he draws attention. I also agree with Semprinni that the recordings in which Pete Best interprets the last word on the reason for his dismissal. <br /><br /> Although the film is not as luxurious a production as the later &quot;Backbeat&quot;, I prefer this film because it is more precise and because it has a better script with a deeper characterization. <br /><br /> There are many things in the film that are quite important, such as Brian Epstein, who tries to hide the fact that he has been &quot;beaten by force&quot;, only to discover that the band knew he was Gay all the time. Small touches like the band that goes to a cafe and asks for &quot;Corn-Flakes mit Milch&quot;. My favorite scene, which has some bass, in fact, is where at an audition Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his bass but can not play it, so he has his back to the businessman and tries to fake it, but he gets caught. That&#39;s rock &#39;n&#39; roll. <br /><br /> Well worth seeing.']
