This movie has no history. It's just a group of boys who torture an innocent girl to death. <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> This is what they do: they hit her, put her in a net and let her hang inside like a bird, turn her on a chair until she vomits, expose her to a loud noise, pour boiling oil over She puts worms in her sores, crushes her hand with a hammer and finally passes a needle through her eye. <br /> <br /> This movie was so realistic that if I did not know it was fake, I would have thought it was a snuff film. Although I disliked this movie, I liked it a lot. That scared me. I suppose it fulfills some kind of purpose. I give it a 10/10.
