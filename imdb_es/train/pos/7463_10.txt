It seems that this movie is polarizing us. Or you love it, or hate it. I loved. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment (s) they say, you should only "feel" this. <br /> <br /> Also, at the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting made by Monet - an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in small dabs, so up close, the picture looks like a disaster, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a "vanilla sky". I think this is a suggestion for the viewer. This movie is like that impressionist painting. It is the impressionist cinema! And it is not by chance that the title of the film refers to that painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear plot. It requires more thought. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump and no, you will not always be sure of what is happening. But in the end, everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You will have to concentrate on this movie, but I think that people are making the mistake of concentrating too much on it. After it ends is when you should think about it. If you try to decipher it as it develops, you will be overwhelmed. Just let it happen ... "go" with that ... keep your mind open. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the first level performances and I thought it was tremendously unique, tremendously creative and fascinating. <br /> <br /> But I will not criticize the intelligence of those of you who did not enjoy it. Appeals to a certain taste. If you like spiritual, challenging, provocative, psychological, existential, psychedelic movies, then watch it. If you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you like what I described, you will surely enjoy it.
