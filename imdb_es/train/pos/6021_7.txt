['Although this is not necessarily a &quot;classic&quot; movie by today&#39;s standards, it is still worth watching. The main reason why is because after experiencing this movie, you have the feeling that you have also experienced the countercultural idealism of the 60s, regardless of whether it is good or bad. <br /><br /> By chance I saw this film in an English literature class at SUNY Geneseo, and although at first it seems to be just a meaningless composition of the icons of the 60s, the film is far from being simply &quot;thrown together&quot;. <br /><br /> My point is that if you leave the film feeling dissatisfied and confused, the film has done its job: it transmits a desolate vision of the future that leaves you feeling insecure and angry. Perhaps it was this same sensation that the film sought to explore in the youth that it exemplified. <br /><br /> As such, &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; may not tell a very good (or interesting) story and, at the same time, its characters may be unilateral and predictable. However, it also conveys this kind of clich√© so well, the rebellious desire to get out of existence that both Mark and Daria must share. Even the students against the establishment are as unreliable as the government they rebel against.']
