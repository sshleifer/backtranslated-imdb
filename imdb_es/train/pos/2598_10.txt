In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in New York; That fall in graduate school, I read the book for the first time. Part of the pleasure of reading the novel was my scrupulously detailed film memory. And for better or for worse, and now I&#39;ve read and taught the novel for more than three decades, Milo O&#39;Shea is still Leopold Bloom.']
