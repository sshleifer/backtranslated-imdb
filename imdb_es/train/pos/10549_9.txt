I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it's released completely because I want to see it again. It's a film based on the characters, and Andrew and David are more than willing to do the task. Any discussion of the plot could be considered as spoilers, so I'll just say that the story is intelligent, that the acting is excellent and that the effects are incredible. Well filmed and good pace too. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and very refreshing in this summer of sad movies <br /> <br />. I had the audience laughing all the time. See it if you can. (I especially liked the scene "Candy bar! Candy bar!")
