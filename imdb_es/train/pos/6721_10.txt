['If it were possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport (no, the pure lifestyle) of surfing to its perfect form, this documentary has achieved it. This documentary shows that life is not just about the waves, but it is more about the people, the pioneers and the avant-garde of today who are pushing the envelope of the great wave farther than ever. <br /><br /> Stacy Peralta, a virtual legend of my first years of the eighties as a SoCal teenager, has edited materials and incredible interviews to its essence and created what is not just a documentary, but a masterpiece of the genre. When his heart and soul are on the subject (and he is clearly here), his genius is charged with a pure vision that does not fascinate, exalt or sentimentalize his subject. Beat surfers and the surf / beach lifestyle, but neither bleach it. There is also a great reality in sports. <br /><br /> There is much that can be said about this documentary, about surfers, the early history of this sport and the great wild surfers it describes. Greg Noll, the first personality of the great wave who was possibly a pioneer in sports; Jeff Carter, an amazing kid who rode practically alone for 15 years in the extremely dangerous Maverick surf in northern California; and, the centerpiece of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, the current messiah of the big waves. <br /><br /> There is a tremendous heart and warmth among all these guys, and a few girls who appear before the camera, and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that appears in every word. I found the story of how Hamilton&#39;s adoptive father met him and how Hamilton, when he was a small boy of 4 or 5 years old, practically forced him to be his father, especially comforting (and, again, stripped of syrupy sentimentality). <br /><br /> If you like to surf, or even if not, this is a wonderful documentary that should be seen, if only because you are a student of the form or someone who simply appreciates the works of art incredibly well done.']
