Rarely have I come out of watching a movie with such a warm and happy feeling. I felt like I had dated very good friends and had a great time! I enjoyed this movie very much. The performance was excellent, although I would have to mention Bill Nye, in particular, for giving an absolutely impeccable performance. Bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and always love to see them, because they provide such a solid performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, totally beautiful. It was a wonderful performance by everyone involved. A refreshing experience to see a well written movie, superbly acted and good looking.
