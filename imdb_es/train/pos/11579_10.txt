This movie is a masterpiece, a story of a young woman during the war, and it really happens, not exactly like the movie, but it's a great story. I was impressed by this movie, the performance and the story where I like it. The film, because it's a true story, I got the feeling that I was there and I feel sorry for the director that Maruschka Detmers is playing because who wants to end life like that here. I recommend that everyone have to watch this movie, especially the young people and for the learning of this film. This film can be compared to the orange soldier film or any real story that happened in World War II.
