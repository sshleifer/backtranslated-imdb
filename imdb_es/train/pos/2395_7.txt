Although he had the misfortune to get to the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film), when we were getting tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, this film deserves an audience. A look inside the staging of "The Scottish Play", as the actors call "Macbeth" when they produce it to avoid the curse, this is a clear, efficient and elegant treatment of the betrayal that happens to the company. With a wonderfully evocative score, and with a much better look and sound than your small budget suggests, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but totally satisfying.
