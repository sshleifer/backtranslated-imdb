World At War is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time. Historical research is virtually impeccable. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about WW2. A valuable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures of the war. I highly recommend it as a learning experience.
