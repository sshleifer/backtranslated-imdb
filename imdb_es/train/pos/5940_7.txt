this short video trailer is basically about Superman and Batman working together and forming an uncomfortable alliance. Obviously, the two characters have very different views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment. It's really fun to see these two iconic characters try to understand me. I will not go to the story here, but to the performance, which is fantastic. All are well chosen. The two actors who play Superman and Batman are very suitable for their characters. The same filmmakers as Batman: Dead End and Grayson also made this short film. Of the three, this one probably liked me the least, but I still thought it was well done. For me, the best thing in the world is a 7/10
