Soapdish can become one of the most underestimated movies ever made. <br /> <br /> A stellar and disinterested cast that understood exactly where the film was going and the roles they played in it. While everyone tried, there was not a single skill. Kline showed ingenuity and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to keep a funny conversation while someone else spoke, I could go on. <br /> <br /> Do not pass this movie!
