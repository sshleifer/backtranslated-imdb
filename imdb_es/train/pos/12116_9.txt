... that the Bette Davis version of this film was better than the Kim Novak version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, although the Novak version has a more coherent story line. <br /> <br /> However: the raw emotions of Davis' Mildred seem to me more apt to be a lazy girl who seems to easily be a prostitute. <br /> <br /> And that's those raw emotions that constitute * part * of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, of failure, of "otherness", strong emotions that he represses. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, shows her emotions immediately and without censorship. He has no feelings of despair, of failure or of "otherness"; rather, she is simply surviving as a poor cockney woman in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Novak was a Mildred more vulnerable than Davis, almost throughout the entire film. Davis' Mildred was never ** vulnerable ** until she had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when he reproaches her, for her method of keeping body and soul together, and for continually taking advantage of her love for her, she unleashes possibly the most passionate repudiation of a more sacred snob than you've ever seen on the screen: "I cleaned my mouth. I wiped my mouth!" Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis's realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> IMDb votes coincide!
