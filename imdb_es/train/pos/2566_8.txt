Any film that treats fanaticism in a positive way is a film that must still be seen by the current public, since the message and the moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film is really an old-fashioned love story ... the boy knows the girl ... the children lose the girl ... the boy retrieves the girl ... <br /> <br /> The weakest paper goes to the late Kent Smith as Lieutenant General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is the second closest) ... my question would be how he became a 3-star general ... the character is so weak in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, it is a wonder that they show him respect at all. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a bit of an exaggeration, and some scenes have some holes but in general, I enjoy the movie every time I see <br /> <br /> Red Buttons is great ... I always love watching comedians in dramatic roles ... as in the case of Button, often a comedian can better represent a person's tragedy than a more traditional one. ramatico actor
