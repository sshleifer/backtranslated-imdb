An independent feature can now be seen as a cinematographic work of art and a video summary. Enter Broken, and aggressively promoted, short twenty minutes with style and enthusiasts to spare. But is it good as a movie or does it only work as a demonstration piece? Oh, there's the problem. <br /> <br /> Rota is the story of Bonnie Clayton, who was kidnapped after waking up from a recurring nightmare one night by "a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage" (quote from the video box). While she is captive, it is obvious that her kidnappers know things about her that even she did not know about herself. While being interrogated, a soldier dressed in black gets into his hiding place in an attempt to rescue her. Chaos occurs. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he's doing, or at least he's very good at pretending. Broken does not suffer from a lack of visual instinct, which is especially advisable considering his budget and the inexperience of everyone involved. What it suffers is a weak and derivative writing. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets The Matrix, written ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer / writer Jorge Rodríguez is that the elements of the story are easily ignored by the piles of goodies on display. Does the plot really matter a lot in a short twenty minutes to show the technical skills of its creators? No, not really. <br /> <br /> Although it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspect in light of the budget and duration of the film. Broken is not a classic genre. The biggest problem was that, in reality, it would have worked better as a full-length function. The final "turn" does not have enough time to be shocking. If Ferrari were allowed the time to slowly burn the function as needed, the elements of the plot would seem less random and the film more complete. Here is to know that you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> The Dolby Digital 5.1 Audio Broken show is second to none in the independent world. I had never heard such an aggressive sound in such a small sound. The soundtrack inspired by Matrix is ​​very rich and deep, the shots have punches, and even the dialogue enters into the enveloping effects. Of all that is presented in this album, it is the audio that expresses the praises of modern and independent DVD production. An equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround track is also included, which is the default menu option. <br /> <br /> Extras There are literally hours of feature creation on this disk. In fact, there are so many extras that I find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here, while I wait for my readers to continue reading. Regardless of the shortcomings that the real short may have, the DVD is unprecedented in its information resources. People who enjoyed the film can learn everything there is to know about their production, including everything from conceptual art to promotional campaign. Those with plans to make their own independent film can learn everything they need to know about these features. <br /> <br /> The extras are divided into categorical menus. These include: preproduction, production, postproduction, after the short and distribution and equipment biographies. From a critical point of view, I found that some of the sections were quite short. If they had been edited in a menu option, it would have been less frustrating to navigate, since the cursor appears by default in the top selection with each return to the menu of the main section. This, of course, is just a trap, but maybe for future DVD releases, the filmmakers will take my advice seriously. <br /> <br /> It has six audio comments and hours of interviews and talented people, and despite the consonant. The sale, its true colors shine. <br /> <br /> The willingness to share your film secrets with anyone who buys this DVD is quite generous. From the extras I learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective, what camera brand creates the most professional look at the lowest price, even where to get cheap soft armament. In addition to this, they gave me several alternative options, in case I could not locate any product used in this particular production. Aspiring filmmakers who are not willing to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this DVD. <br /> <br /> In general, I have rated the real short as 6 out of 10, but I would like there to be an option for the length of the feature film Potential and Effort, because I would have scored it with 8 or 9 in these fields. I recommend the DVD for its characteristics and as a perfect example of what can be done with only eight thousand US dollars. Those who buy the DVD can consider themselves as ghost producers for a larger project, since the more attention these guys receive, the more funds the long-form version will get.
