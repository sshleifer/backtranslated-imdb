I remember this movie from many years ago. Certainly the best film on the subject in my experience. The fact that I vividly remember much of the film after so long shows its impact. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of the performances due to the language barrier. But, nevertheless, they were very powerful. <br /> <br /> This theme continues to fascinate us even as the years go by. And it was treated more effectively here, with the right proportion of historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is that? Is any archive of art films hoarding a copy?
