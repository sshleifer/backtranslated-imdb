I have not seen this 1958 film in a long time and I really enjoyed Kim Novak playing the role of Gil Holroyd, who is a real witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch and Gillian also has a sorcerer brother named Nick. Jack Lemmon When Gillian sets her sights on Shep Henderson, (James Stewart) who is engaged to a girl she is going to marry; Gillian interprets some magical spells with a cat and changes her mind about her intended girlfriend and then becomes filled with lust and falls in love with Gillian. The story says that a real witch can not fall in love, blush or cry and this starts to be a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided they have to do something about it. Great movie to watch again and again and a great 1958 classic movie.
