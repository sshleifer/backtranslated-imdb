A typical game through the reality of Cheech and Chong that includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, extraterrestrials, gasoline, laundry, comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE. It's not as coherent or plausible as Up in Smoke, but it's still incredibly fun, without being as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes, which include the opening scene, where they get some gas for their car and drive to work. Cheech's (Mexican-American) song and Chong's follow-up song is also fun. Another notable scene is the welfare office scene with Jones (human noise machine), from the series of the Police Academy, and the old man laughing. In general, this is an excellent follow-up of Up in Smoke and is quite visible when sober or not. <br /> <br /> -Rehabilitation of celluloids
