This silent gem not forgotten tells the true story of an escape of prisoners of war during World War II. The performances are amazing, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is witty and sounds very true. In fact, an unusual general authenticity puts this head and shoulders above most war epics.
