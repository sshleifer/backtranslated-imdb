Comedy typical of the 90s, situational comedy similar to today's "My Family". Being the height of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for everything she can. "Bloody Thatcher" possibly shared with most of us. David, the typical teenager, cutting his brain with knives for bread, Jenny, the older teenager in a bad mood, only interested in children and more children. Bill and Ben work as hard as they can to keep their family afloat by fighting in the economic climate of the early 90s. Of course, the first two series were not as successful as the last ones, however, the series 3 onwards is where It all starts with more laughter than I would like to tell. In general, this show did not have the best viewing times and should have stayed a little longer. They clearly could not have continued after the death of Gary Olsen, but I think they should get rid of "Catherine Tate", the office, "Little Britain" and bring back the classics.
