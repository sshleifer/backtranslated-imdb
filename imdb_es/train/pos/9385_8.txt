Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a movie can be with virtually no budget. All you need is an intelligent script, good actors and a lot of atmosphere. RRW delivers all this and more. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays an ex-sailor, injured in Lebanon, who has gone down to his last $ 5 after being denied a job in an oilfield due to his bad knee. He plays in Red Rock and is confused by waiter Wayne (JT Walsh, not as the most menacing, but still evil) with a hitman from Texas. <br /> <br /> He pays him to kill his wife and make it look like a robbery. Only when he arrives, just to see her. She offers him double to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to leave the city with his free money and leave the training lovers. But a series of setbacks and setbacks result in you entering and leaving the entrance and exit of Red Rock. Eventually, this leads to a meeting with Lyle of Dallas (a cheeky and sympathetic Dennis Hopper), the real Texas hit man who offers help without knowing that it is complicating the plot. <br /> <br /> RRW never had a big release, so most of the audience discovered it on video or cable TV shows. Seeing it this way can make it look like a television movie, but it's bigger than that. The good direction, the slow pace, the bad mood and the howling of the desert would have made for a great movie in theaters, but the best thing you can do these days is to watch the DVD on a large HDTV. <br /> <br /> The only weak point in the movie that I can remember is the bored femme fatale of Lara Flynn Boyle with the nasty dike-ish hairstyle. I certainly would not fall in love with her, but if you assume that the character of Nic Cage is in the militant lesbians, however, you will accept it.
