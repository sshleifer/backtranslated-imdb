I resisted watching this movie and I understand why it was not a big success in theaters. "October sky" feels and looks so familiar. And it is. All the artifices and emotions of the plot have been explored before in other films, and possibly even better. But despite its familiarity and resistance to all Hollywood formulas, this film is winning and enjoyable at every step. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul. Just as the characters in Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG gaped over the roof of their apartment hoping it would launch their next generation ("What's it called? They call it a miracle.") Sputnik has an effect similar in the young Rocket boys of this true story. While the towns of the coal town in 1950 abandoned the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket to get out of life in the mines. <br /> <br /> The masterful direction and the launch make the journey of the rocket boy Homer and his friends look fresh and new. Especially affect the subplots related to the sick master of the school of Homer. The remarkable restriction is shown by representing their delicate relationship. Also notable is the father / son supblot that anchors the movie. Perfectly played everywhere. Even Homer's mom gets her moment without clich√© or intrusion. Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heartbreaking. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> An important chain of videos that I despise has a sign next to this movie that says that you will love this movie or that you will be refunded your money. For once, I agree with them. You will never see the October sky in the same way again. <br /> <br />
