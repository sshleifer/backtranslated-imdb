I could not believe the comments that were made about the movie. <br /> <br /> When I read the horrible opinions about the movie, I was really wondering if you had actually seen the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> What I saw was amazing! I think the actresses and the director did a fantastic job in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had not had the pleasure of seeing any of the two actresses before and I could not have been further delayed by the incredible work they did. I must say that it is the most credible movie I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> What I do not see is why everyone has so many problems with the choice of Deanna's drug in the suicide attempt, for the comments, it seems that it was the choice of the actresses and their stupid choice. I do not understand that, it's a movie written by another person and directed by another person, so I can not see how the actresses' mistake can be. I think it was a really credible movie that I would see and recommend again. Opinions are what they are and it is a pity that so many are so intimate. I hope to see some of the actors soon, I think they all played great roles. <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps will be the best-paid actress one day and I hope she can laugh at everyone who criticized her! You go girl
