['That&#39;s how I felt when I saw this movie. I loved. It was hilarious But I felt it was like I had a furtive glimpse of someone&#39;s psyche and then I was laughing as I twisted to make an interesting point. A friend put it this way: <br /><br /> &quot;I feel like we broke into someone&#39;s house and now we&#39;re watching their horrible videos without their knowledge.&quot; <br /><br /> Another of those facts is more strange than fiction movies. &quot;Groovin &#39;Gary,&quot; the original &quot;Beaver Kid,&quot; is a boy from a small town who appears at a nearby television station hoping to film a movie, and he certainly does, though not, maybe, as he initially expected. . With high hopes of fame and importance, he invites Harris to come and film a truly horrible talent search he has organized in his hometown, led by his own act of dragging &quot;Olivia Newton-Don&quot;. <br /><br /> The director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story. Some images of a clumsy child who wants to be someone are transformed, in two later reinterpretations, into the history of the freedom of sexual identity repressed in a small city in America. Harris simultaneously criticizes the attitudes of the small city of the United States, the cult of celebrities and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry. <br /><br /> Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover take impressive performances. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative, so he follows closely the &quot;Gary video&quot;, but with strong nuances to express the interaction the way Harris wants it to happen. <br /><br /> In the end, the naivety with the open eyes of the original Gary is what moved me, when compared to these possible interpretations of their situation. <br /><br /> A movie not to be missed I have not seen anything like it. <br /><br /> Jacob']
