This was the first film they made together Joan Crawford and Clark Gable and then they would make several more. Crawford stars as a rich young woman whose father is eliminated in the stock market and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job, but it passes quickly. Crawford becomes a newspaper reporter, but he wants to work on big stories, but he is given worthless things to work on. His is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford witnessed the whole thing. It's a good movie but not one of its best.
