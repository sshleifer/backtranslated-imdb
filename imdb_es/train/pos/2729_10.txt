I voted excellent for how well he acted, not for the content. I still get chills after reading the book and then watching the movie. Two ex-convicts travel to their destination to steal money from a family from one of the insurances they learned while in prison. During the trip, the tension begins to increase, as the soundtrack of the movie adds to the general anticipation. Once the killers finish their work on the farm, the next morning, the remains of the family are found by the friend of the daughter's church. The eerie scream, while the scene enters the phone with the wire cut, really made my blood cool and gave me chills. That the murderers have fulfilled their just destiny is a small consolation for this condemned family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also written by Truman Capote.
