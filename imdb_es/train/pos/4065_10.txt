I have seen the original version in English on video. The choice of Disney voice actors seems very promising. I can not believe I'm saying that. The story is about a boy who knows a girl with a story that intertwines with his. The two are launched into one of the most entertaining and intriguing stories of any animated film. The quality of the animation is excellent! If you've seen Disney's work in Kiki's delivery service, you can see the quality in its production. He almost exchanges them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion. (But not quite!) Finally Miyazaki's films are released correctly! I can not wait to see an English version of Nausicaa without cuts!
