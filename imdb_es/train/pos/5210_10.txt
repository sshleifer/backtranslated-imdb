It's a shame they did not give credit to the screen, as much as he did the best job in the movie, he has the girl on the cross, the best part of the movie. She had much more impact than Avril, or almost anyone else in the movie. . It almost made S / M look fun! She really was believable, she has the S / M model who is scared of her situation. Although it seems that they really have ruined that kind of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad boy, those sets were very well constructed, but they just brushed the surface of what was shot. This is a movie in which both cuts should be available. It seems that they left a lot of what was filmed, and almost all the really dark things that would have made the film much more demented. It is as if they had not reached the mark they were looking for during the shoot. What was filmed would not have scored R, probably an NC-17 or X, but that's what it would have taken to make the film as it should have been.
