Sophmoric this movie is. But, it's funny that everyone leaves. It shows the "children's wardrobe mentality" that is being interpreted by the "other side". It's good to see how the tides change and how silly they are. But that's probably not news for most women, because (just ask one), "they've all heard them before." <br /> <br /> Look at it with a small group or a mixed gender party and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight. And the other 2.7% ... can you really please them?
