I can not believe a movie that could be so good in 1987 and that is practically unknown in the west. Do not repeat other reviews here. The score is very good and moving. It literally means "Dawn, please, it never comes": when it arrives, the beautiful ghost and the lover will be separated forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. I enjoyed Joel in God of Gamblers and many Leslie movies, including Better Tomorrow.
