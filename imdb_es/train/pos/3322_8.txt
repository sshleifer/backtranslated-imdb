If you want to see something that is for 'him' and 'she', so to speak, this is the movie you should choose. I'm a fool for coms rom, but my husband is not always so enthusiastic (what a guy!). Anyway, I got to see him because I told him it was sports, and you know what, he loved it! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and her protagonist (I'm sorry, but I can not remember her name) is just as good. When I saw the movie, it was called 'The Perfect Match', but I think the title was changed for the UK as it is based on the book Fever Pitch and there was already a film about football with that title (the same movie but the UK version: Ugh!), <br /> <br /> Anyway, all the comments here will tell you more details if you need them to buy girls, take them out, put your husband / boyfriend in front of the television . a Saturday night and both will laugh and cry together. A true jewel
