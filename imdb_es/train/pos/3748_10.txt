I have seen it many times and I am planning to buy the full function. I love the whole Jason Steele comedy. It is very different and unique and it is very nice. I love indie movies and this is great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a talking spatula called Edward. The order of events is a bit confusing, which makes this movie very interesting to watch. At first, you see Edward fighting with the spoons, but then the focus changes early in his life. This is a silly movie, but of course, it's still great. I recommend you watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It is fun. The humor may not match everyone's taste, but see it anyway. It will only take 16 minutes of your time, and it's free. Go see the madness of the spatula!
