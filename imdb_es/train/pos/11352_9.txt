['This is a fascinating account of the search for the first known serial killer of the Soviet Union. I had tuned in, just waiting for a decent television movie, but I was attracted to the compelling way in which the story was told. As others have said, there is much to admire here that, unfortunately, is lacking in many large screen releases. <br /><br /> Much of the credit must go to Chris Gerolmo, whose intelligent script and direction attract the viewer, until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved. The performance of the entire cast is also excellent, especially that of the two protagonists, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their compelling representations give their character arcs great credibility, and the scene in which they have their first committee meeting after Perestroika is really moving. <br /><br /> If you prefer your crime movies with a little more depth and a little less bright, I recommend you look for &#39;Citizen X&#39;. <br /><br />']
