13 days for Glory tells the traditional story with sympathy towards the Mexican point of view. The main problem in this film was that, while cowboy actor James Arness played the role of Jim Bowie persuasively, the rest of the actors with name in the cast Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) They were too old. <Br /> <br /> Raúl Julia played General Antonio López de Santa Anna with the grace and dignity that is owed to the professional soldier who, after all, won the battle. The scene in which he rebukes his officers for not having mounted a guard and avoiding a noise is one that the writers did not understand. Not watching is an important oversight in the army. Santa Anna was within his prerogatives to get angry. Raul Julia beautifully carried the bad writing through the scene. <br /> <br /> Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, you might have reminded Kathleen York that, as Dickinsons came from Pennsylvania, it probably does not sound as good as Southron.
