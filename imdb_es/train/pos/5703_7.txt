I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner and this movie explores some of those death and meir movies from the 80's that I like to see, so I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> In general, the essential stupidity. The protagonist of the film noir is not well taken out by the female protagonist and her hero is almost a Neanderthal, hence the warning of Kitch.
