This film had a large set of adult actors along with a cast of young actors who will be in the movies for a long time if there is justice. The address and editing was great. I can find the book from which it was adapted, it must have been great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were amazing to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis did not see each other enough, but they were fun when they were on screen. The children in the camp could not have been better. (Like I said, I liked it!)
