To be honest, I did not really like this movie when I saw it for the first time. But I guess the problem is that I have not seen it in a theater. Big mistake ! Because the # 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the configuration and # 2 is the cinematography. Try to watch this movie on the biggest possible TV and with a great sound system. The music is good and puts the film at a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of Renny Harlin's best movies. This guy knows about the action. Die Hard 2, The long kiss, goodbye, etc. And it's particularly good in this movie. The special effects are great and spectacular. Stallone really needed the film to come back successfully. It's still good to see it!
