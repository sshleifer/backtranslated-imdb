This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it to anyone who has a local video store. Or, better yet, you can buy it because you're likely to see this again and again. I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and it was great back then. But after seeing it again yesterday, I thought it was incredible. <br /> <br /> A good combination of comedy (although not as good as "Mr Magoo", another of my favorites) and action. This is worth 10/10 and I hope they do a sequel soon (fingers crossed). If you take care of children or have to take care of small children for something, then I recommend you rent this movie, as it will keep you entertained for hours :).
