Cameraman's Revenge is an unusual short, not because of the subject (adultery) or because it is animated (Winsor McCay had presented Little Nemo in the film for this time), but because it represents insects to tell the story! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted to film the real bugs fighting, but could not get them to do it in the camera due to the hot lights they suffered, so he took the dead and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate the movements for his satisfaction. This short does a good job of putting human characteristics on small creatures like riding a motorcycle, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also be Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first notable work would be this one. If you are interested in this and the other shorts mentioned, visit your local library to borrow the DVD The Cameraman't Revenge and Other Fantastic Tales from Image Entertainment.
