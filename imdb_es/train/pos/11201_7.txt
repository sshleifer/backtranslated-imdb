['Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original scripts written by Hitchcock himself, this film shows a remarkable story structure. It begins with an exciting boxing match in which the carnival champion &quot;One Round&quot; Jack loses to a challenger from the audience that turns out to be a professional boxer. The film then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, his girl and the professional boxer. The rest of the movie is a dramatic buildup of the rematch between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. Even in this first film, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and accessory placement. A bracelet purchased for the girl by the boxer continues to appear throughout the film as a symbol of her infidelity. The only major detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927. The final result, as a result, ends up being somewhat anticlimactic. The story, however, is what this movie transports.']
