What a fun-filled, sexy movie! They certainly do not do it that way anymore. 4 sexy au pairs come to London and have all kinds of sexual misadventures. The tone is strangely innocent, since considerable nudity evolves out of ridiculous situations, rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters. It is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant. Richard O 'Sullivan literally gets' Randi' (sic). The film undoubtedly reveals the origins of the soft film as lies in old-school nudity and naturism films. My special interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is that I am a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If some actress has seen herself better naked (she is thin but with wonderful curves), or is dressed, go to that (I have loved her since the original UFO run, who else could take a purple wig!), I will eat my hat.
