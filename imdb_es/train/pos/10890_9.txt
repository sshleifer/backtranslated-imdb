Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I can see this happening ... the rich people have done more crazy things than this. And it was fun. <br /> <br /> I watch a comedy to entertain myself, escape the pressures of the world for a short time and not have to take anything too seriously. This movie is fully adapted to that purpose. I judge a film on its own merits and do not compare Surviving Christmas with Blazing Saddles. I watched totally dysfunctional people become affectionate and nice people who could easily live on the street from my house. It will remain on my list of "favorites ..... you should be aware of the holiday season". If you just want to have fun for 90 minutes, look at this one.
