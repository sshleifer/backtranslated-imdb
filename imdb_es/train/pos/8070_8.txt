I do not doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film by dint of a three-way division between the Mutiny on the Bounty tracks of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone, all in the same race. But The Informer is still a good movie because John Ford would not have won his first Oscar for Best Director if he had not been. There is no division involved in your prize. <br /> <br /> The film and the story of Liam O'Flaherty on which it is based involves a poor impersonator of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. . They took him out of there for an imbecile trick he did and he wants to come back. He is in his last pennies and, if he can not return, he wants enough to move to America. There is a twenty-pound reward for information that leads to the arrest of a former classmate named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness, he goes to the Black and Tan police and informs McPhillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is quite anxious to know who pulled McPhillip and they are pretty sure it was McLaglen. He does not have the wit to really cover his own clues. He makes a feeble effort to involve another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek. It also picks up a hook played by J.M. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> All the action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from six in the afternoon until the next morning. By necessity, it is shot in the dark and in the shadows, which makes it possibly the first black thriller. If it had been done after the Second World War, The Informer would have classified itself as a great classic of the noir, like Odd Man Out or The Third Man, which is very similar. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this world very well. He took some time off during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at that time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before he had it in English was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays the IRA commander Dan Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is a harder and bad man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character so movie fans would have a special interest. Make it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informant because Black and Tans will grab him, take a little more out of him and put the whole organization in danger. <br /> <br /> The IRA test scene is the highlight of the movie. When Foster asks Donald Meek if he recognizes the authority of his court, Meek is not in a position to say no. Justice and the king's order do not run here. Illustrated graphically at that time, despite the occupation by army and police troops, the British are losing control over the population. <br /> <br /> Of course, The Informer, a rather grim story, has its John Ford touches, but less than you would expect. Even when McLaglen is spending his money on a wave of drunks, the IRA is constantly in the shadows observing him and counting everything. <br /> <br /> The informant is a well-told story about Ireland in a dark and gloomy time.
