I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Delany sisters. I knew about them, but that was all. This movie opened my eyes to his courage and courage. What a pair What sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms. This is not just a movie for African-Americans, but for all Americans. It is a kind of history lesson and a documentary in one that is combined with a funny film biography. The performance was superior in all aspects included and we really glimpsed the difficulties that these two sisters went through for many years. Both sisters are very different from each other. They came from a very loving and very strict family with high standards of perfection, maybe even impossible. It is sad to see how Sadie's father refused to allow his daughter to continue seeing her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding. I recommend this movie and I'm glad I saw it on TV the other day.
