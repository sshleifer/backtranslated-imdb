When I think of this movie, all the adjectives that come to mind are somehow related to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, that's how I think this movie should be judged in terms of. Observe the rich golden tones that surround the sleeping young concubine by the fireplace, or the suffocating Turkish bath, and let it flood your senses with impressions of spices, rough cloth, soft skin, perfumed oils, flickering flames, satin noise. Do not just watch and listen, be absorbed, let the narrator's monotonous voice hypnotize you.
