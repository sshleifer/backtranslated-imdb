Two years passed and most of them all look different, some for the better and others for the worse. However, I still enjoyed it as much as I did with the original. <br /> <br /> Some faults that they had, like changing the Joker, now do not have red lips and it seems more blackish hair and black pupils, still has the voice of Mark Hamill, which is an advantage, I suppose. They made Poison Ivy realize that she is more like a plant and Catwomen looks very different and not as "attractive" as it was in the original. <br /> <br /> Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrow have a rough look, especially Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The program is not as dark as the original because Batman does not work as it used to. Most of the time working with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes to the rescue often. Batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and it looks like it got a little bigger, but still kicks tons of ass. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as the original mainly because of some of the updated characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the Edge" could be one of the best episodes of Batman, so be sure to check it out. <br /> <br /> General 8-9 / 10
