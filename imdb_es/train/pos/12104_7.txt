Well executed, old and very dark from the house of horror. Good configuration that includes the character of Poe, himself, alluding to the story in a pub in London. Although from here it is practically the only one who has dared to visit the house one particular night, running from one room to another looking for or avoiding people, it is still the most pleasant. We also have the charming and enigmatic Barbara Steele. There is a little dialogue of wood and some unexplained fragments and movements, but it is the super spooky atmosphere that is maintained throughout, that and the super musical score that makes this progress well. DVD originates in the United States and has some extras
