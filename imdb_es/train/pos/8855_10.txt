Sydney Lumet, although he is one of the oldest active directors, still has a game! A few years ago, he shot "Find Me Guilty," a test for everyone that Vin Diesel can really act, if he has the opportunity and the right director. If he had retired after this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one could have blamed him. But he's still getting stronger, his next movie was already announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But let's continue with this movie right here. The list of actors is incredible, their performance first class. The small nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogue and / or the situations that evolve throughout the film are simply amazing. The (temporary) structure of the film, which holds the toes all the time, combining the timelines so perfectly, that the editing seems natural / impeccable. The story is accentuated by that, although even in a "normal" time structure, it would have been at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only recommend it, the rest is up to you! : o)
