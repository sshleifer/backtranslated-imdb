Wow. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, it seems that this is the only movie written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in it. <br /> <br /> The performance is sublime. Giving up Zhou as Doggie was amazing, a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight, very believable as the old jaded traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, guiding without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only more movies like this one were made, either in Hollywood or in Hong Kong, a friendly jewel, good acting, well written, well directed, almost perfect.
