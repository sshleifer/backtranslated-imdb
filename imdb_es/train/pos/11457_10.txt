As the jacket proclaims, this film is "Superbly filmed and masterfully edited" and, yes, it is fascinating and beautiful. The timelessness that we perceive in Stoic rock and in the incessant ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works of Goldsworthy's hands so that in their very efemerality they point to eternity. <br /> <br /> And so is the beauty of his compositions. It chases us with just a touch of woven melancholy - or in the words of Matthew Arnold of "Dover Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! you hear the roar of the pebbles that the waves withdraw and throw, Upon their return, above the high strand, They begin, and cease, and then they begin again, With slow tremulous cadence, and bring The eternal note of sadness. <br /> <br /> At a point near the end of the movie, Goldsworthy says "Words do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more." Since I am a blacksmith myself, I do not take offense for a moment, I consider it immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that Goldsworthy creates in a conscientious and intuitive way, is something more than what the words. <br /> <br /> In another point he comments on "What is here to stay ... and what is not". That is your subject. <br /> <br /> I believe that artists at some point in the twentieth century realized how ephemeral great works of art are compared to the vast expansion of cosmic time; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral. The idea was that, by emphasizing how brief are the most powerful works of human beings, a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is of this type. expression. Carefully compose some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it, or place it in the river where it will drag it; and in this process both the composition and its efemerality merge. <br /> <br /> Both the transient and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it. And it is important that these works are made within the context of nature so that what is composed is established within what is natural. Therefore, the stone walls and the stone eggs that Goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid, but we know that they are not monuments of eternity, but that they will remain indefinitely and then dissipate and return to a state very similar to that existed before we arrived. <br /> <br /> This is art as art should be, similar to the spiritual. <br /> <br /> In a certain sense, Goldsworthy's work is an inarticulate understanding. It is an experience purely of time and form. In a certain sense, his work "responds" to Shelley's famous poem, "Ozymandias", saying that, despite the tide is dragging the work, and even when the river dissipates the expression, the art is still alive thanks to our experience. Similarly, one thinks of the Tibetan sand paintings, so carefully composed and measured, and then, as they are finished in such a beautiful and precious way, they surrender to the wind so that we can know that everything is flow. <br /> <br /> However, in the modern world these works of art remain in photos and videos. Goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer (of course, I would say) and all his works, even those that are not, he says, are photographed so he can look at them again in a more reflective mood and see what he has achieved and what he has achieved. has achieved. You can not lose. <br /> <br /> This film production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately captivating music of Fred Frith is not to be missed. It is one of the most beautiful documentaries I have seen and one of the most spiritual.
