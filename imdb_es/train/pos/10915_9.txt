The RKO studios decided to borrow William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia, for one of their larger budget efforts to capitalize on the popularity of The Thin Man. They were successful to some extent. <br /> <br /> Many people forget that in addition to Nick Charles, Bill Powell also played in some films by Philo Vance in the lead role. So at that moment he was pretty well established on paper. Dr. Bradford is not making as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles, but Nick is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress, Dr. Bradford works to make a living as a doctor. That helps in his detective calling and, in fact, he does in this film. <br /> <br /> He has two murders to solve. A rider falls off a horse that enters the farm of a great race and dies for no apparent reason. The trainer suspects there is something going on, but he has run into the most conventional method of a bullet. This is after he went to Bill Powell for help. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy was a stronger influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur interprets him as a lady more dizzy than Loy. But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> The always reliable James Gleason is the police inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All they needed here was Asta and possibly Eric Blore, since Powell's butler was rehearsing that part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur were signed in this study, we could have seen a lot of Bradford movies.
