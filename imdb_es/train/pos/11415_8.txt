This is a great movie to watch with your girlfriend. My friend and I love to dance and we found this movie in the video store. We had to get it. Without violence and such a warm story, it is a great movie to relax and enjoy your night. I would recommend this movie to any family or just to a group of girls looking for a nice movie.
