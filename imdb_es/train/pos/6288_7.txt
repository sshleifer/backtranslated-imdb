GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of every four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, elegant and elegant action image with a high octane star power and many Awesome looking cars. If you are a viewer interested in cars, it is worth watching this production by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock") to delight you with the shiny vehicles. Although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and emotion make it an exciting summer success. <br /> <br /> The film is starring Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad") as a young thief named Kip Raines, who, when the movie opens, does not deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened by that, his older brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but deft car thief, is called to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars, specified by model, color, year and makeup only four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis disburses the first three days by recruiting a team of bandits to help him carry out the robbery. The team includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy but abrupt retired car scammer who meets Memphis through previous businesses, a man named Mirror Man (TJ Cross), the elder and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> A secondary argument involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that Memphis contributes to the impulse and tension of the film and your team are not up to par Good and keep a very attentive eye on them. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people through their resilient lifestyles and take on hard personalities through the hard and elegant core of the film. To make matters worse for the film, the dialogue does not define the characters with a harsh cultural tone. I am not saying that I believe that profanity and vulgarity are necessary for thrillers to thrive; In fact, I honor the director's decision to maintain extreme rude language in a film that could have earned an R-rating effortlessly. However, I do believe in a movie like "Gone in 60 Seconds", to strongly develop the lighting of the character, the dialogue must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective due to the superior notch, and the performers are perfectly responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and compelling. The sordid appearance of Angelina Jolie is completely appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously robust and credible. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains a standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that explains the style of the story and the character's motives. It establishes a fast-paced action theme, but lacks depth and a strong introduction of characters. In the second act we find some more problems: history is wasting time during a large part of this segment, it is never built for the third act. While half of the movie takes a long time, and a sex scene provides a solid intermediate plot, not much happens. The third act is almost a pure adrenaline rush that contains a furious wall-to-wall emotion and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of "Gone in 60 Second" contributes a great deal with the inspirational action scenes. It's scenes like car chases that make this movie work despite several destructive faults. Dominic Sena, whose career has mainly consisted of directing commercials, has an attractive style and a decisive attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds" that will give the audience two hours of shock, excitement and emotion, but not much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
