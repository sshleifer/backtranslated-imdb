This was one of the best programs ever made for television. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. Compulsive visualization I was lucky to see this in the United Kingdom. They may have misunderstood the order of the episodes, I do not remember, but at least it was done at a regular time every week. My girlfriend and I got hooked on the trailer and none of us is a big fan of the American series normally. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew that this was something special. We missed a couple of episodes, and you got sad and angry for a week missing those lol. <br /> <br /> Great casting, excellent performance. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black had an incredible performance for a boy, and Paige Turco was also at his best since Party of Five. And Nick Searcy, of course, as the Sheriff's suffering partner. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and puzzling bits, which I suppose would have been explained later, and certainly would have been in a later series. That made the end weak, and you could say he was killed. He made us go WHAT? Why did they do that with one of the best shows in history? Shoot the exec.
