I have copies of these two films, the classic in which Robert Blake is an excellent and powerful actor in which most of the 1967 film, Blake, is seen standing next to a window in prison, telling his life of childhood, where he has not killed the Clutter Family. Show a lot in the classic of what really happened and do not tell us which one actually committed the murder, but it really is a great attraction if you watch the 1996 film In Cold Blood, the classic makes much more sense.
