This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as mentioned elsewhere in IMDb), but he became a great matchmaker. It brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors that work. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) clicked on the screen and made this a great visual experience. The fact that he drove a car to move seems to contradict all those images and posters of him on a bicycle to move around. And he wore socks in one scene ... reportedly, the teacher never wore socks? (Two new entries for the IMDb bug section.) Leaving aside historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give an 8!
