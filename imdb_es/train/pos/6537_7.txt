The children I brought to this movie loved it (four children, ages 9 to 12, would have given it 10 stars). Emma Roberts was adorable in the lead role. (I hope to see more of this next generation of Roberts in the future.) Having been more exposed to the likes of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was comforting to see a girl who did not seem to work on the streets. I also enjoyed to see a cast that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (with a cameo by Bruce Willis). End to take: Nice movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I did not read the series of books, so my comments are based solely on the merits of the film.)
