The best Modesty Blaise movie I've seen so far. It's like a good pilot for a television series. I even think it's a little "cultured", like with a light touch of Quentin Tarantino's magic, or something like that. They have captured much of Modesto's character, but I admit that he missed Willy Garwin a little. Even if I have read many comics and a book by Peter O'Donnell, I am not disappointed with this movie, quite the opposite. Positive surprised of this story about modesty and his childhood. I did not set my expectations so high, due to the bad movie of 1966. Therefore, I may have exaggerated this movie a bit. But if you like comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see this one! I can not wait for a follow-up ...
