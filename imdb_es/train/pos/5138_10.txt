In 1994, I had a very long vacation around July 4, something like 17 days of vacation in a row, what with two weeks of paid vacations, weekends and the holidays itself. I stayed in the city during that time, spending a lot of time in my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I did not have a TV in my apartment, so I used to see my parents' tube. I had just finished watching a segment of the X files when a program called Personal FX appeared. I was hooked instantly. I had always been fascinated by the articles in our house that came from the houses of my parents 'family and from the inheritances of my relatives' properties, and I often wondered about their history, value, etc. <br /> <br /> After my long vacation, I used to go to my parents' house at my lunchtime just to see the personal effects. <br /> <br /> I can recall an episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced the New York apartment in which the series that was filmed was being renovated and, once it was said that the renovations were complete, Personl FX would return to the air. Personal FX was the first and the best of the collectible shows. And vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I am still in pain. <br /> <br /> Alright, FX.
