While the style of this film is not as discreet and realistic as it probably would have been a sound version, this is still a very good movie. In fact, it was seen as an excellent movie in its day, as it was nominated for the first Oscar for Best Film (losing against WINGS). I still consider WINGS a top movie, but this one is excellent despite a bit of exaggeration from the leader, Emil Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a general of Czarist Russia who is living his last days. Earning a few dollars in the 1920s for being an extra Hollywood. His luck seems to have changed when he receives a casting: playing against a Russian imperial general who fights against the communists during the revolution. Naturally, this is not too extensive in terms of acting, but it also makes the old man think about the old times and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Exactly what happens next, I'll leave it to you, but it's a pretty good movie, particularly at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as the Russian director. Despite having been manufactured in 1928, with the makeup does not seem much younger than in many of his latest films.
