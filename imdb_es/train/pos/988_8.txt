I liked this movie. When the guy who was in a bank robbery of $ 40 million in gold dies, his cellmate is used as "bait" to take him to a high-tech crazy killer partner (by having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without your knowledge). It's an action movie, spy type, with enough comic scenes to keep it light. It reminded me of Enemy of the State. Good acting and plot good enough.
