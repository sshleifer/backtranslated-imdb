I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and I have never forgotten it. It is beautifully filmed and the story remains fascinated all the time. It's hard to believe that this was done in 1946, since the story is still fresh today, and it really makes us think. I do not have much knowledge about the technique of the film, however, the special effects of this film are fantastic considering when it was made. In addition, the performance is excellent, and the use of English and American actors is quite surprising. I recently bought the DVD, so now I can watch it whenever I want. I recommend anyone interested in postwar British films to see this.
