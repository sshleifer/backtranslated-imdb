What makes Midnight Cowboy a successful movie is the way Joe Buck joins Ratso Rizzo through a series of difficulties that affect them both. There really are not many glimmers of hope in this movie for any of the characters, but the harsh realities that beset them give the film its own kind of optimism that these men can at least find humanity among themselves. <br /> <br /> This film presents the best performance of Jon Voight and probably also that of Dustin Hoffman. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, although it is completed by a good series of character actors, including the cowpoke on the bus at the beginning of the film. In addition, for those interested, Andy Warhol's apprentice, Paul Morrissey, appears briefly during the party scene. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, it is essential. Check it out.
