Standard ascent to the history of fame that has some high points. Number one, Lonette McKee as the sister who gives impressive performance, making stars. The fact that she never became a huge sensation after this overtakes me. Unfortunately, she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on Irena Carter's soft character, Sparkle, whose rise to fame is easy, boring and unconvincing. However, every time the girls take the stage and act, the film comes back to life. The original music of Curis Mayfield must be praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. The quality of the image was quite low, as well as the production values ​​that I suppose. In general, it is worth taking a look.
