I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. She was really amazing in this movie. The emotion you must have spent shooting a new shot after a new take is not enough to think about. This was a very difficult movie to watch, the subject is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so powerless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity. In fact, I felt that everything was deflated a little when her friends returned to the house and I did not find the conclusion entirely plausible. The director seemed very interested in using the height in his shots and he loved using the reflections of the mirror, I think he should have paid more attention to the rhythm in the second half of this piece. I'm sure this is a great piece of theater, this film for me, although it had merit, it fell short.
