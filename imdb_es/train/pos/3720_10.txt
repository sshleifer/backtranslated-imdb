Joel Schumacher made a great choice when he decided on this cast and script. The story is well written and well presented, and this completely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. It seemed like there were 6 "clues" and a half dozen support, and this is the best thing about the film, the young and fresh faces of tomorrow. It has been a long time since Hollywood has touched on the controversial Vietnam War films, which say something about the "story that needed to be told" (as stated by Schumacher) and Tigerland lands in that handful of the best war movies. However, it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of Bozz and the others. I think anyone who just wants to see a good movie without all the special effects, but just a good drama should go see Tigerland, obviously, Shumachers Best works in the last 8 years.
