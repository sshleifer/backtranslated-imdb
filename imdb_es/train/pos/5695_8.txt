['Some films manage to survive almost only by their originality. &quot;Wonderland&quot; is certainly one of those movies. The script manages to throw everything in an almost feverish tone, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not chosen to cover a weak script, but to accurately reflect reality impregnated with drugs. <br /><br /> As a director, James Cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors. Most of the characters are perpetually on the edge, and often because they are rather ugly personalities. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes as a con man, capable of manipulating and controlling. It is not offensive to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems only capable of controlling the drastically weak of the mind. However, it is an impressive performance. Comparing this with the more &#39;Hollywood&#39; roles of Kilmer as in &quot;The Saint&quot;, it seems to show that he is much more comfortable in high quality indie films. <br /><br /> The actors are the main force that keeps all together. There are several small performances that stand out, especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow have a limited screen time next to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. Apart from Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give strange and surprising energy to their roles. <br /><br /> At first I stopped seeing &quot;Wonderland&quot; because I assumed it was a movie about a porn actor, in the strictest sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it literally has nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this movie is a murder mystery, and as such, it&#39;s excellent. <br /><br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10']
