They often laugh out loud in the fun game about sex, family and classes in Beverly Hills. More grouts laugh at the zip code than has been seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett. The plot focuses on two drivers who have bet on which of them can put his employer (both single and soon as single, quite sexy: Bisset and Woronov) first. If Manuel wins, his friend will pay his debt with a violent Asian street gang. If he loses, he must be the last man for his friend! <br /> <br /> Many obscene dialogues, pretty sick physical humor, etc. But much of the comedy is just below the surface. Bartel is memorable as a very sensual member of the family who ends up taking his sexy and teenage niece on a one-year "mission trip" to Africa. <br /> <br /> Hilarious fun.
