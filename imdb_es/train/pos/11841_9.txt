This was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) loved this movie, including me. The music was fantastic too. No, the horses do not speak, but the story is told by the Spirit. And listen to a story told by the point of a horse if the view was fun. <br /> <br /> I think the title says it all, "spirit". This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I should say that this film affected my 4-year-old son and my 5-year-old daughter a lot, and they even got so angry, they laughed a lot and in the end they encouraged the spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "Spirit" with your family and raise your spirit with this moving story. Your children will love it. I think you will too.
