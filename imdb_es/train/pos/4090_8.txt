This movie is just amazing! I had expected something very different from the movie I really saw. However, it is very insightful because it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its connection with animal behavior. Let me warn the readers of this article that they are easily offended by the content that is too sexual, since the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a kind of high level pornography. It even presents a scene that is very close to rape. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of "sexual art". By the way, every minute of the image breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies. Do not forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go see it! It's worth your money and time!
