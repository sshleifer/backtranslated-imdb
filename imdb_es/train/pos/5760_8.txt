My roommate ordered this out of the network a while ago and I was finally able to see it. It's disgusting. It's cheezy It's pretty silly ... but it's also very funny. I mean, this was the most fun we've seen watching a movie like this for years "City of the Living Dead." It was like being in the old Drive-In Theater again! You could tell him that the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible zombie movies dubbed. This has all the clich√©s and tricks of those movies in one, and it's clean because it's SUPERIOR that it's that way. The cheeze factor is high, blood flows and laughs roll! The effects go from careless to good, with one in which the man breaks in half and the other in which a man receives his heart pierced in the chest, both excellent! The performance goes from terrible to pretty good. There is not much plot, just lots and lots of blood. This is inspired by zombie movies from Italy and Spain, I think, because they stay in thick scenes forever, like this movie. If you like Troma movies, Cheezy grade B things, then you can not go wrong seeing this. A good way to lose a Friday night!
