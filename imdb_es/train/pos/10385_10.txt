It's been a while since I saw this movie and the series, but now I'm refreshing my memory! This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were fun together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse to direct Moonshine in General Lee. When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes to leave their farm, Bo and Luke sneak around Hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal. Soon they realize that Boss Hogg is going to dismantle the county of Hazzard, unless the Dukes can stop him, with the help of his beautiful cousin, Daisy. My only two problems with the movie was that Burt Reynolds was not suited for the role of Boss Hogg, and that Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. Apart from that, I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD !!!
