When the first DEATHTRAP was released, the poster, reproduced on the cover of this DVD, offered a graphic similar to a Rubik's cube. It is an appropriate image: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, who was the author of memorable works such as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of the most famous tornadoes on Broadway, and under the direction of Sidney Lumet translates into the screen extremely well. . <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those films that is very difficult to talk about, since doing it in any detail gives the very fabric for which it is famous. But the opening premise is extremely intelligent: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mystery plays, but these days he seems to have lost his touch. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a script for a work he has written. It's called "Deathtrap", and Sidney recognizes it as a sure hit. Just the kind of blow that would revive his career ... in fact, a blow to die for. And when Clifford visits to discuss the game, events begin to turn in the most unexpected way possible. <br /> <br /> Like the twisted SLEUTH of Anthony Shaffer, DEATHTRAP is really a story more at home on the stage than on the screen. To achieve maximum power, you need the immediacy offered by a live performance. Even so, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, he makes a more than respectable presentation on the screen. Much of this is due to the cast, which is remarkably well. Michael Caine offers a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is fun and endearing as Sidney's relentless and anxious wife, and Christopher Reeve offers what could be the best performance in his pitiful career as a short actor. If you can not see it in a first level theater production, this will be more than enough until one arrives. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
