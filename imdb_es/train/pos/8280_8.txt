George and Kim travel with their son Miles to a remote cabin in New York State when his car collides with a deer and veers into a ditch. But what seems to be a mere misfortune, marks the beginning of a frightening journey, where the myth becomes reality and a devouring spirit of flesh, half animal and half Wendigo man, torments a small city ... "Wendigo" by Larry Fessenden is a scary horror movie that often turns into a somber family drama. The acting is excellent. the characters are well developed and there are some chilling moments. The subtle flashes of Wendigo are handled effectively and it is never clear what is real and what is imagined, or even if the story unfolds entirely in Miles's head. In general, "Wendigo" is my first contact with the work of Larry Fessenden and surely it will not be the last. Give this movie a chance, if you do not mind seeing something unconventional.8 out of 10.
