['This film is almost a generation of importance for some of us born in the early post-war years in that (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and you loved spending Saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie theater) it&#39;s almost I&#39;m sure you saw it. . And the memory of having seen it probably stayed with you. His style is the subject of a brief and glorious exciting moment in our growing days. <br /><br /> He had a modern space-age storyboard for the audiences of his time. The set was any city with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be filled for a show at midnight on Friday. He has hot rods and young rebels, but in the &#39;why can not we let ourselves have fun&#39; instead of the disturbed, histrionic, rebellious form without cause. All the characters were identifiable: teenagers, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the child, the puppy, even the police, sympathized. We could relate to all of them. <br /><br /> He had a singularly horrible monster. It is the first victim to be heard to moan &quot;it hurts ... it hurts&quot; and we are convinced and scared. The threat grows continuously throughout history. There are intense periods of suspense, colorful effects, a fabulous advantage in McQueen and moments of humor, both intentional and not. I even had a sad part almost exaggerated to make the most sensitive of us feel like crying. <br /><br /> I saw it in summer, around 9 years old, with double bill with &#39;I married a monster from outer space&#39;, and I was so moved by the experience of this particular double feature that I went back a couple of times before go away. Everyone I met saw it. Everyone I met loved it.']
