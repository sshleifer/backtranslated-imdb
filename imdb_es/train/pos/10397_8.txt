['The creation of The Thief Of Bagdad is a story in itself, almost as wonderful as the story told in this film. Alexander Korda almost broke making this movie. <br /><br /> According to the book of the Citadel Film series on The Great British Films, the adopted son of the United Kingdom, Alexander Korda, had conceived this film since 1933 and had spent years of planning and preparation. But unfortunately, World War II met with Korda and the escalating expenses of filming a great show. <br /><br /> The budget costs also happen in the movies of the United States, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand in Paramount after 1932 when he returned there. But DeMille and none of his American contemporaries had to worry about the enemy bombs while filming the movie. During the filming, Korda transported the entire company to America and filmed those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genius in our Grand Canyon. I certainly was not going to have a scenario like that in the UK. Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day of 1940. <br /><br /> The show of the thing earned The Thief of Baghdad four nominations for the Academy Awards and three Oscars for best color photography, the best art and direction for a color film and the best special effects. Only the original musical score of Miklos Rosza did not take home an award in a nominated category. Korda must have been very happy to have decided to film in the Grand Canyon because it is impossible to get bad color images of that place. <br /><br /> However, special effects do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil. The good thing is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez. This was the role of Veidt&#39;s career up to Casablanca, where he played in the Luftwaffe major Stroesser. <br /><br /> Of course, the good gets a little help from an unlikely source. The child beggar and thief Sabu, who could well have been one of the few who could call themselves an international film star at that time. Literally emerging from poverty working as an elephant child in stable for the Maharajah of Mysore, he was discovered by Alexander Korda, who needed a native leader for one of his jungle characteristics. Sabu captures all the innocence and evil of youth by fulfilling the fantasy of the Arabian Nights of the child who knocks down a tyrant. It is not a bad message to send in 1940 to that. <br /><br /> The thief of Baghdad holds very well today. It is an eternal tale of love, romance and adventure in the order you want.']
