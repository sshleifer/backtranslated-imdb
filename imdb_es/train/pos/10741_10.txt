The French brothers Naudet did something that nobody else did, they had a video camera on the day that this tragedy happened. They were in Building # 2, when you could see the papers that were moving down, the people who hit the ground jumping from that height. <br /> <br /> I mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed, they ran away, their camera was still running, when the white dust covered them, they found a shop door and they entered, but all these images They are real and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing them for us. <br /> <br /> Ten The stars are for the Naudet brothers who filmed this extraordinary movie that I watch every 9/11, so I will never forget what happened in this country. I think that if I remember correctly, it shows the first death of the priest of the firemen, while they were taking him to the church and his honorable funeral.
