Loaded with symbolism and full of wonderful cinematography, Extase is much more than the erotic drama we all expect. This is almost a silent film, with the dialogue that is in German and very simplified German. Perhaps the filmmakers tried to make the film reach the widest possible audience in Europe, since anyone with a high school German level can easily dispense with subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding at a cinematic, non-narrative level. The symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm human characters, there are even scenes where flowers hide the face of the alleged star Hedy Lamarr, and here are moments that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl . If the film has a message to convey, I think it is political: the bourgeois man is timid and impotent; the working class is a happy and productive creature; and the woman is the creator, destined to be dissatisfied until she has a child. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma does not overwhelm the film in any way, it is a beauty to see from beginning to end, but it puts it in a very different artistic era. And, oh yes, Hedy takes off the kit.
