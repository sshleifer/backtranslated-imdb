Very slow pace, but intricately structured and, ultimately, very moving. A pretty and very faithful look at a small coastal town in Florida in the middle of winter: I've been there, and this is absolutely accurate. <br /> <br /> It's also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd, and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old. I remember seeing it in theaters and recently I rented "Ruby" again. Except for the 80s-looking clothes, it has stayed very well. Ashely is so radiant and moving here, that it is hard to think about her later career without a grimace. Boy, talk about not fulfilling your early promise! Anyone who saw Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" would assume that this elegant and natural beauty extended to all kinds of interesting artistic films and serious performances. Instead, she has become the girl for action movies and action movies! Very disappointing, but at least we keep this beautiful performance to show its early promise. <br /> <br /> As other commentators say, this is not for everyone, as it is very slow. This is not an action movie, nor is it really a romance. The director (Victor Núñez, "Ulees Gold", another excellent study of characters) treats the life of this ordinary young woman with deep respect, allowing her story to be built slowly and with many details. That way, I think this is one of the stories of the most moving and respectful young women about young women I can remember. It's not about Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost her virginity," but about her life choices. and its growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A lovely movie, if you take the time to watch it ... I think it would be a really excellent movie to show to teenagers and young girls (or children). and give them the opportunity to think and discuss it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the director Núñez, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and very detailed that I assumed throughout the film that was based on a novel or memory written by women, but in reality it is the work original of Mr. Núñez. Classification 8 of 10.
