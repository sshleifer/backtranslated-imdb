['Home Room was a great movie if you ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more. Wondering what secret Alice is hiding. I think I saw that movie 6 times in a row and I never lost interest. Also, I do not usually cry about movies, but it made me cry every time. I wish I could find more movies like that. In general, I thought it was a great movie. The more you look at it, the more you become part of it. The end is the part that really caught my attention when she cried when she got her diploma, because she had her daughter&#39;s name. My heart felt as if it had broken in that moment. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she still had not got his. I love him so much.']
