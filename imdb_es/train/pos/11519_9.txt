The only reason I did not give this 10 stars was the DVD format, without menus, extras, etc. However, if you have ever dreamed of doing something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream, do not let anything or anyone stop you. This is one of the most affirming movies of life that I have seen. And magical. The acting is excellent, the plot has the purpose, and the opening sequence is fantastic. This is one of those movies about which the status of "cult" used to be treated. I have recommended this movie to all my friends. Some love it, others can not finish it. Whenever I think, or feel, that something is impossible, I think of the role of Alan Arkin in this film. I'm sure I'd like to make more movies.
