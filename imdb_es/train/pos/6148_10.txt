IN LOVE THE MEMORY OF DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I saw this film for the first time, I was 4 years old and I was fascinated by this story of witches in World War II. The scene, which impressed me the most, was the struggle between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was exceptional to see this army without a body walking to fight the astonished ones singing their march. This film is fantastic, from the trip to Portobello Road (which for me was the most fantastic place in London) to the trip to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. She is always great, it seems that the good aunt of a family and David with his face always amazed is his great co-star. we will miss him very much
