['This movement was very funny !!! The most fun I&#39;ve seen in a long time, akshay and John kick their asses as always, and the girls are also good. the story is amazing, lots of great jokes, and whoever has reviewed this before me is an idiot. I tell him that you are not of Indian origin, so you would not understand humor or idiot. Do not rate movies that you do not understand. What did you see, the subtitle version where most of the jokes are lost in the translation? that&#39;s what I thought idiot. <br /><br /> akshay kumar is the best actor of all time and demonstrates once again his versatility, not only can he do action but also comedy, and he is excellent at that. John has also proven himself, this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at that.']
