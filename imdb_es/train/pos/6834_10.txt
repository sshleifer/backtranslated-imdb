Let's cut to the chase: this is the movie that would take me to a desert island (with a DVD player). It is simply perfect. If a reason to see a movie is that you love actors, you like to see them for free to get involved in space and feelings, this movie is for you. Watch the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) enters the scene drunk and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to improvise because he no longer follows the script. If you are sensitive to the movements of the camera, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage, the particular flow, which gives you the impression that the camera follows the actors as if it were the theatrical principle of "space" private". "... amazing ... and the story is just a brilliant mix of story and realistic drama." Cassavetes is once again arguing with Hollywood and the politics of the elders, but this time, he does it through Broadway, making one of the movies more exciting about the theater ... Well, this movie is a joy.
