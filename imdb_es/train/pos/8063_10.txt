This incredible Oscar winner (4 in total) and the first winner of the John Ford Academy Award, is simply fascinating with a strong Max Steiner score. Called an art movie, because Ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and punishment, and greed and stupidity. But what makes this film so classic is the direction and the amazing photography and the use of fog and lighting, which was very different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. And the Oscar-winning performance by Victor McLaglen as the drunk Gypo is simply amazing. Basically, the film takes place in Ireland, and Gypo gives a friend in the rebel movement to English to raise 20 pounds to give his girlfriend. But with all that money, he starts throwing it to a drunkard all night and giving it away, while the leaders of the movement are trying to locate the informant. The whole movie is a night in a dark and misty Ireland, and a cast of characters that are memorable, but all the time, the whole world of Gypo is approaching him, both psychologically. If I had to choose three directors to have ALL their films on a desert island forever, and no one else, John Ford would be one of them. What a truly remarkable movie ...
