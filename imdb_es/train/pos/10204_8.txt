Although it's not the best Anime I've seen, but I enjoyed Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I have never read the comic, I only saw it in the video store and decided to give it a try. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, it gave me the feeling of the anime of the 80s, which is what activated it for me. Why everyone else hates that is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The development of the character was fine. I like how they brought Hope's transition to Lady Death. For you that you do not like, obviously you did not pay attention. Lucifer tells you how it happens and she used his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a good mentor / soldier for her. his dark style was perfect for this type of film. <br /> <br /> I think everyone who has hit this needs to take another look and reconsider. because everything that people have shattered can be said of all the favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
