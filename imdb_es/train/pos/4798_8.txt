This is not a movie for the fans of the typical mysterious things of Lynch. Rather, it is for those who appreciate a good story, or have grown tired of the current things with open sentimentality and Oprah-ish "This is such a wonderful movie! You must see it!" - Semantics (although 'she is right, for once!). <br /> <br /> The story unfolds perfectly, and they take us on a journey that, I think, most of us will come to recognize at some point. A compassionate and existentialist journey in which we amend our past as we approach our inevitable disappearance. <br /> <br /> Acting is flawless, cinematography too (sometimes quite bright!), and the dialogue leaves enough for the viewer to grasp the details of the story. <br /> <br /> A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental.
