This film has problems in its presentation, it may even be offensive to people seeking temporary and cultural fidelity, but it challenges the viewer to reflect on a variety of subjects. One of them is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, it is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the relationship between Christ and the traitor is developed and maintained through the film. The passion of Judas presents itself as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judas takes his life, the viewer can feel the anguish. Peter's denial and guilt, no matter how moving, is not as powerfully portrayed as the drama of Judas. Chris Sarandon offers a new and provocative Christ, credible or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even on VHS, for use in study or discussion groups.
