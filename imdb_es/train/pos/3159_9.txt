... and the series lets you forget all that. I'm about three years older than the children portrayed in the series. I was born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage and got my first graduation job after college during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70s were a truly terrible time to be young: inflation, competing for the minimum after school - salaried jobs with thirty-something dismissed, terrible music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this series does not ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70s look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. He manages to look 70 directly in the face, complete with authentic clothes for the time, and still fills the show with the hope of young people and the things that make high school and college years the best and worst . Then there are the parents. The two young lovers on the show, Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti, really have terrible parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward, although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 60s finally reached the suburbs during the 70s. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960s to show their entire lives in order to give legitimacy to their rarity. Eric's friends, Fez, Kelso and Jackie, complete the group representing nerdiness, well-intentioned and snobby incompetence, respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he received, even when those cards are handed out by absent and negligent parents. I recommend all eight seasons, although the eighth season is delayed a bit due to Eric's absence.
