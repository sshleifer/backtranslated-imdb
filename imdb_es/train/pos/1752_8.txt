SPOILERS Sex huh? It is one of the most basic parts of human life. However, have we ever taken it too seriously? People always want more, even those who get it every day, and if you have bad luck, there are possible consequences that can change your life. Ironically, people claim that we are all starting to have sex at a younger and younger age (although Victorians get married and have children in their early teens), so it must be increasingly difficult for those who they become so virgin. In the first advantage on the big screen of Steve Carell, he plays a man who has reached 40 without handling it. Deal with innumerable incidents related to playfulness and extreme sex, not to mention more blasphemy than an episode of "Eurotrash", the general plot of the film and its beginning does not sound funny. It is a pleasant surprise, therefore, that for all the inappropriate and failed jokes, there is an incredibly large number of people who come to the mark and leave the audience hysterical. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a good guy With a good job and a nice temperament. At the same time, however, he takes his life shamelessly too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member, Andy's friends discover his secret. At the age of 40, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for multiple reasons, but above all for pity, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) offer advice to Andy with one goal in mind. To get him out of his misery and have him in his house. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about "Anchorman", it was only a matter of time before Steve Carell got an advantage of his own. Impressively, in "The 40 Year Old Virgin" does not disappoint. Demonstrating the desperate and timid virgin to perfection, Carell is a revelation as he gradually increases his confidence as the council begins to help. <br /> <br /> However, Carell is not alone in his performance. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener since the love interest are excellent. Rudd is a personal favorite as David loves to fall apart several times and shares the best scene with Rogen, as the two argue about homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this movie is not the way they do it. Many of the jokes reached the mark, but in reality they are the smart way to flip the message in your head. Obviously designed for conservative America, the whole tone of the film evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest to one of safe sex and abstinence. The virgin does not need sex to complete her life, she only needs trust and true love. A message worthy of preaching and a considerable improvement of what you expect to see at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It is strange to see a raw comedy that is always fun and well acted, but low and Behold, "the 40-year-old Virgin" is just that. Add a well-meaning message and you'll be on the way to a first-class comedy. A surprising joy
