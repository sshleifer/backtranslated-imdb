After reading the book, I found this DVD at Wal-Mart for $ 3 and I thought, of course, what the hell ... I got the DVD and saw it last night. When I started watching it, I checked the execution time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, it's okay, great ... It seemed to work pretty slow, knowing the history and how much of it there was. When I got to the actual murders, I was like, "How much time does he have left?" Checked. "One minute ?! What the hell ?!" I felt incredibly deceived, thinking that the film only progressed through a third of the overall story. <br /> <br /> But then, happily I noticed that the DVD scene selection menu included a part 1 and a part 2. Still I had another hour and a half to go! Then I sat very happy and enjoyed the second half of the movie, even more than the first. <br /> <br /> I admit that I have not seen the original movie of 1967 (despite my sincere desire), I have however, read the novel and felt that it was a pretty decent movie, for a miniseries of television in two parts, that is. I think the role of Perry's paper was completely wrong and some minor inconsistencies leapt towards me, but they are still very well done. The first half is a bit longer, while the second half is much more exciting. I think they should have provided the film more as Capote did his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 after and 1/3 after the killers are arrested. Instead, the film does more than 1/2 before the murders, 1/4 after and 1/4 after the killers are arrested. Again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time, less convincing at the same time that it makes the first half drag over and over again. mistake about making things go on again and again, so I'll shut up. Go see the movie and create your own damn mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
