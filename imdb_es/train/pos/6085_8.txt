The critics are dumb. This movie is fun and smart. I loved this movie very much. Why do everyone hate this movie so much? I wish people loved this movie more than them. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and they worked hard to make this movie. I do not see them making movies like them. So people should just watch it and not comment on it. I like this movie. It's fine through everything. There are parts where he is stupid, but at least they did. Jerry Stiller would love this because this movie has the same performance as the King Of Queens program. But this is better than that. I can not believe that this has been rated so low.
