Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by most of today as one of the best directors in the history of Hollywood, but this film proves that it is. Mankiewicz, already a success at making sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve, as well as adapting Shakespeare to the life of Julio CÃ©sar, does a wonderful job of bringing this successful Broadway play to the cinema and He does it with style. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if he can not sing very well. He is the only actor who could achieve it perfectly with his absolute freshness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job acting like Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sparkle with great chemistry. All supporting actors do their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny tone. Still, Mankiewicz should be given most of the credit for bringing a good musical in its own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes, but still a story in its own world. In short, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels that you normally should not have.
