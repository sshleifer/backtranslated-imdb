As a Westerner observing the point of view of another culture and the tradition of marriage, I found Just Married fascinating and charming. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger through mutual agreement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern era. However, this is the case in this Hindi movie. Counted with humor and a fresh perspective, we learn from Abhay and Ritika that they have only met once and are now on their traditional five-day honeymoon. As it was said, it's hard to believe in this influx of cell phones that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still takes place. We see the discomfort that this young couple feels when they get together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even if they do not know each other. We see different views on marriage and commitment, as presented by other couples also on vacation, from a couple of forty years married to others who are not yet sure of making a marital commitment. There are songs, witty dialogues, moving moments, mixing and comparison of new forms and traditions. Seeing the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the veracity of the story, but it's still a pleasure to watch it. Of course, part of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit stretched and artificial; However, the film in general was worth seeing.
