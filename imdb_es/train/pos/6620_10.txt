If the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this excellent movie. I just saw him a couple of hours ago here in Paris (where the action of the film takes place) and I can still feel the enormous trauma that I received in the back of my eyes ... What a visual impact! I had never seen such a beautiful black and white photo and such a drastic change in the way of making animated films. I firmly believe that there will be a before and after the "Renaissance", similar to what we saw with the Pixar movies or the experiences of Akira and GhostInTheShell. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films and I hope that this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with some young people who had a dream called "Renaissance" ...) will receive the success and recognition it deserves. Long live France!
