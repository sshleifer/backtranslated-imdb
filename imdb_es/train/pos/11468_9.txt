I am frankly surprised at how little has been done in the movie about the Columbine Massacre. There is not a great documentary, very disconcerting. Fortunately, we are grateful for the talent of Ben Coccio, who directed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant, who made the ELEPHANT, equally good. Two different shots about the event, which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there is something ultimately puzzling and unknowable about the motivations of the two murderers, and what really led them to Take them further Fantasy really horrible. ZERO DAY, supposedly composed of video tapes made by shooters and found after the event, is absolutely fascinating. Even if he knows where he is going, he still hopes that he will NOT "go there" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the film is unbearable. The film is excellent from top to bottom, from director to screenplay (not very improvised, although it seems very spontaneous) to the two main actors, and also to the supporting actors. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that worried me. Well, we can not understand why the shooters would do what they did, but certainly one of the contributors was their ANGER. However, these guys do not really seem angry. They can say some things to indicate that they are, but in reality they did not convince me that they had SOMETHING in them that forced them to kill innocent people. But this still leaves me with the sense of "why?" That director Coccio wants me to have. Anyway, rent or buy this movie, it will accumulate in you and stay with you for a long time. The people of BLAIR WITCH could only WANT for the kind of success that these guys had when making a simulated documentary.
