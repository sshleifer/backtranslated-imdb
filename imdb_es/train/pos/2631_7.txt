If The Lion King is a serious story about a young lion that grows to take revenge for the death of his father, The Lion King 1 and a half is just the opposite, full of fantasy and joy. The Lion King told the story from the side of Simba, the young lion, 1 and a half is from the view of Timone and Pumbaa, a less than perfect duo formed by a meercat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his Friends and neighbors and a boar that has an odor problem. The film is a bit scant in terms of substance, but Disney does a good job filling out several sketches starring Timone and Pumbaa as they "see" the movie with us. My favorite is the song that is performed in the middle of the movie, make sure you see the bounce error! Disney has announced 1 year and a half as "the rest of the story", although in reality it is not. It's just a different perspective of The Lion King, without all the serious things that dominated most of the second half of Disney's original classic. He credits Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for his voice work, without his effort, the film may not have worked. They sing, they entertain, and they make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a jacuzzi with a boar.
