The movie is a fantasy. The story line is thin but it serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and beautifully sung. (I still can not believe that such beautiful and attractive people can sing so well). Part of the dialogue is wonderfully intelligent. The costumes made me feel like I was watching a haute couture fashion show since 1942. <br /> <br /> The films are designed for various purposes. This is designed to entertain and certainly does. If I have a negative comment, it would be that Nelson Eddy was too old to be the handsome and handsome Count. Some of the close-ups made me feel uncomfortable. But I could still sing and sing magnificently. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as dazzling as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is well before my time, and I am new in the films of Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and in a related conversation. The music in this movie is beautiful. As much as I like classic rock music that fills most modern films, I have no doubt that this music is simple and clearly more memorable, more charming, better constructed. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see today in movie theaters. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I'm not sure why so many other posters apologize for having enjoyed this film and, in general, for this group of films. They say it's dated and they try to explain why it's like that. And those who do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what? I think this movie will definitely remain entertaining for people when many other movies are forgotten for a long time. There is too much quality in every way in this film so that it is not remembered or enjoyed. I recommend this film without reservations to anyone who appreciates great talent, great beauty and good music.
