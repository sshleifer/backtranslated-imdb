Kurt Russell is so believable and the action is so constant that you need to think about it later to realize that there were important issues of honesty to kindness [overcoming the fear of The Stranger, learning to overcome early conditioning, the strength that love and friendship can bring, etc.] in history. This is so weird in a 'kid's action movie' that even I [who thinks A / A is a violent dad] liked the movie and I've recommended it to everyone I know ... it's a shame that I have overlooked. because for rights it should have been one of the biggest blockbusters of action and adventure: it has something for everyone, without forcing credulity or losing moments of action almost without stopping. I am afraid that the answer does not become a success lies in the fact that the adults did not come to see it. It is likely that anyone under 20 years has not only seen a more violent action in their video games, but probably not capture the beauty of multiple layers and multiple issues or do not worry about that. This film could turn anyone who avoids A / A as mindless violence. If a man takes his lady [or rents her or sees her on a cable listing] to watch this movie, he will be much more likely to accompany her to other action movies.
