I saw this movie after watching Practical Magic, and the oldest movie was very superior. I liked the way the lighting, makeup and costumes changed as Gillian changed in the story. Jimmy Stewart's manners did not help much in this movie, but I suppose they served to highlight Gillian's character reserve. I was also impressed by the manners of Nicky and Gillian: it was as if the director wanted me to look effeminate and Gillian to look male. The gestures that Nicky makes when he shows Redlich his powers, especially, hit me. I never thought that sorcerers were effeminate, so it was an interesting way to contrast those characters.
