Terry Gilliam's stunning adaptation of Chris Marker's short film, LA JETEE, is full of amazing surprises, but it still touches your heart thanks to the magnificent cast. Gilliam's talent for phantasmagoric works with the script of David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as he does with poor James Cole (Willis at his best as Steve McQueen, better than McQueen, even!), At the moment, convicts of the future travel who, literally, do not know if they are coming or going as a team of scientists who continue sending them to the wrong times while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that is deadly for humans but harmless for animals. Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers. Even the tango-style score by Paul Buckmaster is disturbing. This is a do not miss it!
