What a real deal and quite unexpected. This is a true suspense movie. I ran to the video store, I took a movie without reading all the advertising in the back and I hoped for the best. I was totally surprised and delighted. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought everyone gave a great performance and made their characters realistic. The plot was well thought out, well written and directed. It kept you interested from start to finish and you never got bored for a single minute. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for those who like thrillers, especially thrillers that have a good rhythm and those that maintain your attention. Definitely 10 out of 10 of me.
