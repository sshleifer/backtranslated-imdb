In truth, this really is not a "movie" as much as an extended final episode; with this I mean that, if you had NOT followed the television series (Homicide: Life on the Street), I suspect that it will be difficult for you to follow this movie made for television. That said, "Homicide: The Movie" is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about a television production that EVERY single cast member would return, many after years of absence, to portray their characters and close an incredible show. The film brings out that sense of "family", not only among the characters, but also among the actors. It is very bitter to know that this will be the LAST time that we will see them all together again under the title of HOMICIDA. In regards to the story, I found that this movie is somewhat deficient. The candidacy for mayor of Giardello seems particularly contrived, and I felt that his shot could have been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position, such as Leiutenant. Also, det. The extreme turn of the Bayliss plot, which was hung at the end of the series, finally resolves, but I, at least, NEVER felt that it had to be; I enjoyed staying with a mystery (remember that the first case of the first episode was also unresolved throughout the series). As a fan of the TV series, I can love this movie, and the fact that it was even made after H: LOTS was canceled, but I would not recommend it to anyone who has not had the slightest exposure to the series. Now, if they released it on DVD ...
