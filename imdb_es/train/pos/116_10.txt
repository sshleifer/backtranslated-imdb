Man, oh man ... I've been foolishly delaying (it's not the right term, there's a long list!) To watch this movie and finally I had the opportunity to do so. And the "news" are: Wonderful labyrinthine show! <br /> <br /> For any "follower" of Von Trier: Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in The Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc ... Europe is probably the difference for its greatness in visual terms . Everything is beautifully gloomy and claustrophobic! You really have the feeling of being inside this "imaginary" nightmare nightmare. Taking from the masters of surrealist cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, until the first films of the 1940s with acid drops from the avant-garde, Von Trier leads the art-film scene as the "well-meaning totalitarian" filmmaker of today. His authoritarian way of dealing with very complex problems, without being irrational, hits the nerve of the viewer with the intention of curing some of the deepest wounds that we feed in our hypocritical world. <br /> <br /> As utopian as it seems I think people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader way. The day when films and filmmakers carrying this kind of power are no longer needed, as a tool for reflection, could perhaps be the beginning of a new era: "The era of emotional control over our fears." This is what he constantly offers us through his work over and over again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
