I saw this movie in 1984, first we started watching "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went to see this movie. If you have any conspiracy theory going around in your head, you'll want to see it. <br /> <br /> The question you should ask yourself when watching this movie is: Do you think the government would be able to do this? (In my opinion, there is no doubt that they could) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give too much information, since it would be a spoiler and I think you should see the movie for yourself. <br /> <br /> But, just to inform you, we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world.
