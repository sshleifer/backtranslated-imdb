['A must for any punk rocker, this is the movie that made The Ramones a household name in the early &#39;80s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). This was one of the first and best American Punk Rock movies, with a classic cult status with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally, the producers wanted Cheap Trick like the stars, but the launching of the album &quot;Live At Budakon&quot; had turned them into superstars and a subject too hot to be in a film of low budget. Very good luck for the Ramones who wanted to leave the world of underground punk rock and enter the general market (which unfortunately never happened until after the disappearance of the bands). The band, especially Dee Dee, always disliked the movie through the &#39;80s, but the fans always loved it and could recite most of the movie while they waited to enter the Ramones shows. This movie, like most of the classics, is a stupid fun with some classic images of Ramones in its heyday. Do not wait any longer, you will not find it. It&#39;s very fun, so enjoy it. Another classic film by Allan Arkush in a similar vein is Get Crazy, with Lee Ving from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.']
