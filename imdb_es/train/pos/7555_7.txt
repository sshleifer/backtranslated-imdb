Gender Bender sexifies things a bit for x files. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but a missing ending. Gender Bender is also the debut of the x-files for actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode he plays Michael, a man attacked by one of "The Kindred". You need to watch this episode just to see the less spectacular start of Nic Lea. An interesting thing about the "power of seduction" of the Kindred. When Marty does it to his victims, they turn to him / her. However, when Andrew seduces Scully, she is only disoriented and dazed, and not attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience in that than Andrew. This episode reminds me why it would be unfortunate sometimes to film in British Columbia. Throughout the episode it is so wet, soaked and muddy, it could not have been so much fun. Despite the disappointing ending, Gender Bender is still a decent episode to watch.
