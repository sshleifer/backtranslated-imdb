Of course, if you are reading my review, you have already seen this movie. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I love the concept of a spoiled brat with a servant 24 * 7 on his motorcycle. Watch movies and emulate characters, etc. I love the scene when a stone cracks in Kader's mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a corny story of the affairs of Raja Babu at a table and Govinda in the uniform 'dharam-veer' makes sentimental comments. That is my favorite scene in the movie. The scene 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' is just chemistry between two great Indian actors who make a comic scene without dialogue. It is brilliant. It's a cat mouse movie. Just watch these actors helping each other and even moving the scene away from each other. Your total entertainment. If you like the chemistry of Govinda and Kader Khan, then it is imperative. I think RB is sixth on my list by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1 'precedes this jewel of a movie. 7/10.
