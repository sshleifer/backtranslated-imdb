so yes, it's pretty nostalgic to watch the first episode because this is the only episode I definitely remembered. I enjoy watching the first season and yes, compared to the action-packed shows we have now, this program seems boring. but frankly I like the "less violent" part of the program and the storyline has more substance than the new ones now. I found it interesting that the Airwolf and JAG of Belisario have a similar theme: the main actor (Hawke and Harm) look for a relative of MIA (brother, father). I wonder if the personal life of Robert Belisario imitates the theme of these 2 shows. <br /> <br /> Question: Does anyone have pictures of Hawke's cabin? I love that cabin (something like a cabin of my dreams) and that is one of the scenes I remember of Airwolf.
