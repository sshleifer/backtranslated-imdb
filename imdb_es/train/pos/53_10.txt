Home room really surprised me. Compared to other films that were written with respect to Columbine High School, this is the best. The home does not show the shooting in the school, but the consequences and effects of the community and the city. The film focuses on two opposite characters, Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting. She seems to show no emotion about it. Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna in the hospital to graduate. Meanwhile, the police are investigating Alecia because she could have known that the shooting was going to happen. Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not get along at the beginning. Eventually they develop a mutual understanding and become friends. (very much like the breakfast club). Room at home Beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
