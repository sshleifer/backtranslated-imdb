This movie is much better than the version of the asylums, mainly their war of the worlds. The tripods look very good, but their walks and deaths could have been better. The action scenes were really great. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking! Oh, my God, stop walking please or I'll kill myself. The child thunder scene was my favorite sequence, mainly because a boat rammed several tripods. Good movie, I recommend it for people who have read the book. The music is amazing and the cut of the directors looks very good. <br /> <br /> professionals. Good soundtrack 99% for the book Fresh Violence The tripods and the handling machines are great to look at <br /> <br /> cons. A bit of bad looking acting London
