This movie is horrible, in a way 'so bad that it's good'. <br /> <br /> History repeats itself of so many other films of this type, so I will not bother to describe it. It is a sword / sorcery image, it has a child who expects to realize how important he is in this world, he has a "nomad" adventurer, an evil helper / sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature ... you understand the point. br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was during a very hard winter. I do not know why I decided to continue watching it for five more minutes before changing the channel, but when I went to Gulfax, I decided to stay and see it until the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white hairy creature similar to Chewbacca, but not so useful or entertaining to watch. It seems that someone stuck a lot of white carpets and forced the actor to use it. There are scenes in which it seems that the actor can not move inside, or that is almost falling. Although not much in the movie, the few scenes are worth it! Watch how he tries to speak to Bo Svenson, taking Solo-Chewbacca's comparisons to an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I bought this movie just for that character, and I still have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may look like sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I have never seen the sequel, I have not even looked for it, was because of its absence! Maybe there should be a final film, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will make a long awaited return!
