I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hiphop movies that I've seen like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars, etc. IMO BEAT STREET is the best among the others. Every time I ask other people what their favorite is, then it seems that BEAT STREET is the one that jumps the most. But still, it is the lowest ranked of all. 4.3 is just a hit "under the belt" (if, for example, 5 points is the belt). I love musical performances, breakdance makes me want to turn, RAMO makes me want to throw a piece ... come on, it's a classic!
