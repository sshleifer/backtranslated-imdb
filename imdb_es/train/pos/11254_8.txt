I have not seen this miniseries for a long time and I am pleased to say that its remembered merits have withstood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most of the components of 'A Perfect Spy', the adaptation of the best novel by LeCarré, in my opinion, are top-notch. Outstanding aspects of this are the musical score and the masterful script, the latter written by Arthur Hopcraft who was also, I think, the screenwriter of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' with Alec Guinness a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The actors are mostly very good, some excellent, like Jack Howardhood of Alan Howard and Ricky Pym of Ray McAnally. Peter Egan is fascinating to see because his face changes with every angle of the camera. The passage of time and the effects on the physical appearances of the characters are very well done. So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. The only shake occurs after the character of Magnus Pym is transferred from the very capable hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to those of a remarkably old Peter Egan, who has just left Oxford. But this is a minor stitching and unimportant in general. <br /> <br /> Egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and needs to be "upset" emotionally, that is, to cry. None of the actors has a very easy time with these moments, apart from the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for all that is worth and steals the episode with ease. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is as annoying as Mary Pym. She has part of the character under her skin, but often shows a petulant amateur that diminishes her as a diplomatic housewife of hard biscuit, which is Mary Pym. Rüdiger Weigang is splendid as Axel, funny, ironic and brilliant. I also enjoyed Sarah Badel's camp shift as the baroness. <br /> <br /> The British vision of the Americans is vividly represented in some dryly hilarious scenes. When the Yankees have come abroad to confront Bo Brammell (MI6 chief), the US contingent presents themselves as empty-headed buffoons who seem to have memorized many long words in the Dictionary and generously spiced up with American jargon and psychopath. , to great bewilderment of the contempt of the English. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness blend subtly. LeCarré has a special ability to mix disparate elements in his stories and Hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholic and, at the same time, melancholic atmosphere of the original. <br /> <br /> It is not a perfect production (what is it?) And, nevertheless, the best of Adaptaciones de LeCarré to reach the cinema or television to date. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for all lovers of espionage games and especially for fans of LeCarré. DVD available from Acorn.
