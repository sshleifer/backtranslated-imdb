['In this pool, in this pond, there are water lilies and there are frogs. Frogs sit on water lilies. The frog and the water lily have a parasitic relationship. Marie (Pauline Acquart) is a lily, a fanatic of synchronized swimming in love with Floraine (Adele Haenel), a frog, the captain of her team. The teammates of Floraine reject their leader because the preexaturably curvaceous and well-proportioned blonde transmits to a loose person who betrays the conformity and discipline mentality of the synchronized swimmer. But Floraine has a secret; The bomb has a bomb, which &quot;Naissance des pieuvres&quot; reveals to the public, visually, before it trusts Marie. <br /><br /> Floraine has never gone, as they say, all the way, with a child. <br /><br /> At a party, we see a double image of the blossoming sex bomb that checks her makeup in a bathroom mirror. &quot;Lolita&quot; is a morgana fata. Marie gets to know the double of Floraine while her imitation breaks the heart of the water lily. While the frog follows the movements of catching flies for the sake of appearance, she goes crazy with the water lily when no one is looking. In the most surprising scene of the film, the water lily agrees to give a hand to the frog to lose its virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation. Floraine likes to like boys, but she does not like boys, apparently, but it is more important for the frog that is popular. When the water lily finally kisses the frog, the frog is still a frog. The frog can not be transformed into a water lily, or a princess, because the water lily lost the respect of the frog. After her lips are unlocked, Floraine tells Marie: &quot;Look, it&#39;s easy&quot;, which is the way the frog compares her kiss with the orgasm that her friend gave her as nothing more than a rite of passage without any type of commitment. The beauty of Floraine is a burden. She carries the burden of fulfilling the expectations of the child. Florence uses Marie to have a final adventure before Fata Morgana subjugates her imitation in the closet. <br /><br /> The other water lily, the other frog, Marie&#39;s best friend, Anne (Louise Blachere) and the frustrated toy child of Floraine, Francois (Warren Jacobs), like any water lily and frog, also have a parasitic relationship. While Floraine uses Marie for love, Francois uses Anne for sex. But that is life; that is the betrayal of growing, in which even a friend will become a good friend if the opportunity to ascend the food chain presents itself. In a McDonalds, the water lily punishes the other water lily after batheing extensively in the glow of the frog. Physical beauty is a coin. Marie arrives at the shots because Anne, although far from being ugly, is overweight and has an unflattering hairstyle. Anne tries to defend herself by using her breasts as a great reprisal (the magnifying glass of her Happy Meal incidentally comments Marie&#39;s flat chest), but the tadpole (Marie thinks it&#39;s better than Anne, better than a water lily) points out that her breasts are a by-product of fat. <br /><br /> Teenagers can be brutal among them. <br /><br /> Later, in the final shot, &quot;Naissance des pieuvres&quot; suggests that Marie also has a double, and this symbiosis between water lilies has the potential to become parasitic in the near future, if not yet done so. Teenage girls can be brutal to each other in a way that no child could match.']
