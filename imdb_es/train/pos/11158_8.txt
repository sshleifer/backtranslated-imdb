A shocking and well-made chiller is an undervalued story of atrocious murder and evil forces. <br /> <br /> The doctor of a small town tries to discover who, or what, is committing a series of violent sexual murders. <br /> <br /> Incubus is a tight mystery, with some horrible murder sequences, which accumulates to an extravagant and mysterious climatic touch. The murder scenes are intense and bloody, so this is not a movie for the squeamish! The direction of John Hough, along with a strange music, combine to create a dark atmosphere of fear that runs through the film. It also carries a kind of Gothic atmosphere too. They emphasize the good places of filming and some camera works with style. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad either. The great John Cassavetes has a solid performance as the new doctor in the city. Kerrie Keane's performances as a local reporter, Helen Hughes as a city historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a tormented psychic teenager are also good. <br /> <br /> Everything around Incubus is a forgotten horror movie that must be re-discovered and re-evaluated. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
