What a great movie! This is reminiscent of the wonderful classic Disney family films of the 60s and 70s. I was pleasantly surprised, after the last 20 years of absolute detritus that Disney's live production teams have produced. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute joy. The children's stars were just that; Professional actors, quality. I am very impressed with the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was an insipid and totally flattering hypocrisy here * who ran a prison camp for rebellious children. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the mother of the star. <br /> <br /> I will not retract the story here as it does not make much sense to do it again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was excellent This work reminds you what it is to be a child , while still being sugary or too severe. The deleted scenes that appear in the DVD version were actually better left out. They were too hard for this movie and they would have taken a lot of it. While the abuse was hinted at in the finished product, it was not openly shown to some extent. That was better. <br /> <br /> This was an absolutely lovely movie to watch. <br /> <br /> He gets a 9/10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
