This film, which begins with an interesting opening of two hot blondes that are placed in the back of a vehicle without driver and moving, has a rather peculiar personality. The cast of seven (although a girl does not go for the account of the body, which is unfortunate because the amount of dead is already as small as it is) are super-hot, as our story focuses on teenagers who go out to party in the desert (a strange but effective configuration option), who are chased by a creepy man with black gloves and jeans who drive a black truck. It predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("The Trip," "Joy Ride," "Jeepers Creepers") where the killer's vehicle becomes an evil antagonist. The same killer is pretty creepy, and we found solace in the extremely sympathetic heroine of Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil murderer in all black, while our benevolent heroine wears all the white garb, as scanty and washed of stones as you can be). The director Bill Crain does really cool things with his camera, some tricks on the screen and the cast does everything possible. There is enough blood in the low number of bodies to please the fans of the story, and enough T & A from a couple of girls to please the T & A fans. In general, this film is very undervalued and is widely sought after in the world of movies as it has been proven that it is very rare to find it on video. Highly recommended
