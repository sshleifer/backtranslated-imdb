This Wrestlemania just did not do it for me. While some things, such as real battle and celebrity participation were a throwback to good times, so to speak, it seemed to be more a "cult" in your house than anything else. Above average ... worth it for several games, like the game for the title of the team, although it is worth noting that the change of title did not mean anything, since it was reversed the next night.
