When I found the movie on the Christmas calendar, its title does not sound familiar to me, since I did not read the novel or hear anything about the film. However, after reading the content, I decided to spend Christmas night watching the movie. The effect totally surprised me: I do not remember the last time I saw a movie in which every moment involved me. A VOW TO CHERISH is, without a doubt, one of the films that now constitutes a real surprise that I received from the cinema. Here are some of my arguments for which I consider that this film is a piece of good cinema very underestimated. <br /> <br /> First, all the content is particularly educational. It has something to offer the modern public: pure faith and some answers for universal questions. Is there a need for Christ in our times? Does love still matter? Why is there faith? What are the logics of burden and suffering in life? Is there someone really beside me that I can always trust? The film provides the answers through the content, since everything that happens to the characters can also happen to any of us. <br /> <br /> Second, the film is exceptionally human. The main characters experience internal struggles and face extremely difficult decisions. Is it better for Kyle David Denman and Teri (Megan Paul) to start their own lives and forget about family or to keep the values ​​they were taught at home? Is it better for John (Ken Howard) to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock), his sick wife, and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock), a woman he falls in love with? In fact, Ellen no longer recognizes him ... However, he decides to swear eternal fidelity to HIS WIFE. If the rebellious brother of John, Phil (D. David Morin), continue with his easy life even if it does not bring him satisfaction or once he begins to think seriously about his life. Phil's prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterpiece of the universal aspect of humanity. These words could be said by everyone, no matter where, when or how they live. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is a great portrait of the family, not very popular today: there are still problems. There is always something more powerful that brings these people together. This "something" is love and trust. I know it may seem a bit idealistic. Not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that. However, it is a very educational and realistic aspect. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the whole film focuses on the mutual help of people. If we want to live happy lives in our society, we must understand one thing: we have to help each other. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of such an attitude. At the beginning of the movie, we see him talking with John about praying. Later, help your brother. Alexander is a little "angel" that is sent to John and his family. Is it not possible that we become angels among ourselves? <br /> <br /> Fifth, the artistic characteristics also deserve attention. FEATURES: Barbara Babcock offers an authentic performance as Ellen and, although she has a difficult role, she does a perfect job. Consider, for example, when you appear at school and are eager to re-teach. Ken Howard is also memorable as the faithful husband. IMAGE: The most memorable thing for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park walking on fallen leaves (autumn) while sunlight (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted it as a kind of symbol: even if there is pain, this can always be illuminated by light and joy ... <br /> <br /> VOW TO CHERISH is a wonderful movie that realistically showed me what means To love, what fidelity also showed me once again how beautiful it is to live and believe. In the end, I would like to quote the profound words of the film that I found very touching and I hope you will also do <br /> <br /> Kyle to your uncle Phil: Yes, he (John Brighton) lives according to the Bible. But nobody forces you to do it. However, according to what rules do you live?
