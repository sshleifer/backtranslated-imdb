['I came to see Guerrilla, the second part of the biopic of Steven Soderbergh by Che Guevara, without having seen the previous film and without a superficial knowledge of Che&#39;s life. At the same time, I felt quite apprehensive that this would be as much a lesson in heavy history as an unrepentant love letter for the iconic revolutionary. As a result, this film far exceeded my expectations. <br /><br /> Guerrilla works remarkably well as an independent film. The story of Che&#39;s failed attempt to lead a revolution in Bolivia, and then under military rule, is a compelling tragedy. The initial impulse that brought the mystery of Che&#39;s arrival to lead guerrilla warfare is lost as misfortune follows misfortune. The odds stacked against the revolutionaries. The support of the USA UU The Bolivian army, the hostile conditions in the rainforest, the suspicious premises and the poor health of Che are just some of the difficulties that beset the nascent rebellion. <br /><br /> Soderbergh&#39;s portrayal of Che is largely uncritical, but this film is not a hagiography. The style is refreshing and not dramatic, with a subtle and effective soundtrack by Alberto Iglesias that adds silent drama to many scenes. Without a doubt, Che is the center of the film, but there are very few approaches on his face and he encourages us to see people fighting with him and, sometimes, also against him. When Soderbergh wants to demonstrate the virtues of Che, we see him in small episodes, like the loyal acolyte who reprimands his fellow guerrillas when they question Che&#39;s leadership, and emphasizes the sacrifice he has made in leaving Cuba to fight again for the revolution. <br /><br /> The address in everything is excellent. The second part feels well edited despite its narrow focus and is able to communicate a lot through images without the need for a narrator to explain things to the audience. At the beginning of the film, we see some short clips of luxurious games in postrevolutionary Cuba, which give us ideas of why Che would sacrifice his old life to fight again in another country. Later, the portrait of the guerrillas marching through the endless rainforests stands out as a surprisingly beautiful scene and helps create a sense of enormity of the task before this small band of revolutionaries. <br /><br /> If there is a problem with the film, it is the distance between the spectator and Che, which, although it allows us to appreciate the context of the insurgency and the people that surround it, makes it difficult for us to understand it better as a person. . It is true that Benicio Del Toro is absolutely convincing in the main role, so much so that it is difficult to remember that you are seeing an actor and not the man himself. However, seeing Guerrilla as an independent film means that we are given a small and precious information about what is shaping Che&#39;s thoughts, words and actions. Hopefully this is more relevant in the first part of Soderbergh&#39;s biopic (I still can not comment), and certainly the strength of the second part makes me anxiously wait for the prequel.']
