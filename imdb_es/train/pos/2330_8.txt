This show is good. I like the acting, the funny parts and their tenderness. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, did a great job on the show. The show started off great with its fun and illogical basic idea of ​​bringing the dead back to the first series and, honestly, as people said, the first episodes of the second series were a bit disappointing, but then they looked again. good anyway And now I really hate the fact that it's going to be canceled. Why ABC does not let it end until the end when all the episodes are ready? I really want to know how the story is going to be. I think it should be given a chance, since there are still many spectators who love her.
