Well, I saw this movie when I was a kid and I loved it. My parents never bought me the movie, but I think I'm going to buy it now. I'm a jerk for pre-2000 animated movies. Anyway, in the real review. <br /> <br /> WHAT I LIKED: There was a real portrait of heaven and hell, one of the few I've seen in animated movies. The development of the character existed! It is easy to classify the characters in this movie (ie, Charlie is the selfish mutt, Itchy is cynical but believes that Charlie, Carface is obviously the implacable villain, etc.). I also loved the song of King Gator. I've always liked the noisy, annoying and extravagant guys. This song may have been random, but it was very funny. Finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. You could say that Charlie was all rough and all, and the backgrounds were beautiful. <br /> <br /> WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: The real portrait of the sky: The way Charlie reacted to him, "there are no surprises at all", he did. They actually look very bored. He denied a place in heaven and has yet to return to it at the end. I remember some lines of certain songs like "... you can not keep a good dog down", "... let's make music forever" and "... welcome to be dead" but I can not Remember most of them . The songs were not so sticky, to be honest. Whippet Angel: She is upset and that NECK! AUGH! <br /> <br /> WHAT PARENTS SHOULD LIKE: During the movie, some very scary (according to the viewer) images of hell are shown. Carface is quite threatening. Beer is also implied, but not beer DUBBED. The game is a key element in the movie. The good boy dies. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL: I LOVE this movie, although sometimes it is a bit forgettable. The most terrifying children's animations are always my favorites. This was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to scare children from time to time. Today, this would probably have been rated PG. Children under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed children) should not see this. Apart from that, I give it 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Happy vision!
