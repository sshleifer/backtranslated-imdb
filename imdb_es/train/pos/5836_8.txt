Yes, as the other reviewers have said, this may not be classic L & H, but it's far from being your worst job as in 20th Century Stupid ... I mean Fox. This movie certainly has all the basic ingredients for things go wrong for children. But it's their serious focus and determination that makes them funny. They do not play it to laugh like other comedians, but they take their work and their situation very seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they face some basic problems that any of us could face today, namely, stress related to work. First, a doctor would give us a check-up and he would prescribe a much-needed break and maybe stay at sea. That's where surreality enters all of this. L & H always takes the most plausible circumstances and exaggerates them but never to the point of being incredible, except maybe once in a while. This makes us laugh because we can relate to their own problems and attempts at liberation. That's what makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this film, all those ingredients are presented in a deliciously witty and elegant way. It is not the best compared to his previous work, probably because this was the last film they did for Roach because he wanted to reflect the "big" studios and dedicate himself exclusively to the creation of films, and he also wanted to hurry up and finish his contractual obligation. BIG MISTAKE! They should have stayed together and continue for about five more years. What the world may have lost by not considering this as an option. Look, laugh and enjoy this as your last great performance.
