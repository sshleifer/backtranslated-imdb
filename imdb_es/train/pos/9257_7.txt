Is this the typical woman in chains navy transport love story? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works, a beautiful woman is presented with an image, someone has to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows some typical story lines, but that does not say anything about the content. There are great scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, although short. Some things did not make sense, like the need to participate in random fights, but it's entertaining to watch them, the fights were really well done. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a comedy first of all, but it has a lot of good feeling for it. The humor is well balanced, it will not hurt your stomach with this, but you will keep a smile. <br /> <br /> There's a bit of fiery action, so it's not one for children.
