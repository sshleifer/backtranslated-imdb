I know a lot of people do not like this movie, but I think it's adorable. There's not much I can say, but I think the movie is a movie to feel good about. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful and there are many funny lines in the film, especially when Briggitta learns about what to do and what not to do in society. If you like musicals, I would say that you would like this one!
