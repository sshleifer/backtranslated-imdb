SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important movie of my life because it is the first movie I remember seeing in my hometown cinema as a 4 year old scam. The story is based on Sheila Burnford's novel, and it's a reason why it's not possible to decipher it as a brainless Lassie clone. <br /> <br /> The basic story: two dogs and a cat live happily in the Seaver family when the new husband of the mother of three children, gets a job in the city and they have to move temporarily to the interior of San Francisco, while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months. The ties between the animals and the children they care for are especially strong, and Shadow the Golden Retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are as disconsolate as the children, although the young and cheerful American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less worried and somewhat cynical ( due in part to his voice-over that explains that he was abandoned as a puppy, picked up in an animal shelter and bought by the family), although his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling. <br /> <br /> The three pets escape from the ranch and head towards the wide and dangerous desert (the fantastic desert setting, by the way), driven by Shadow's leadership instincts. They encounter several dangers along the way, hoping to get home, while the family and hosts of the ranch are suddenly worried about the disappearance of the animals. There are funny moments at all times, a great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (memorable quotes), and a touching camaraderie that grows among the main characters during the course of the narrative, marked by moments of sadness (like when the Sassy's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall into the river and wash herself in a waterfall, leaving a moment of loss that viewers feel deeply. <br /> <br /> Somehow, without However, I do not see what the inclusion of saving the lost girl in the desert adds to the story and the journey they take in. Somehow, it seems a bit unnecessary as part of the story. <br /> <br /> The The end causes the stakes to be higher when the shadow falls in a pit in a train yard and the leg is hurt, it is difficult to get out and up, exhausted, followed by Chance climbing with him to persuade him to leave, telling him what important that is for him and how he has pushed them so far so that he should not throw everything away so easily. <br /> <br /> The way this scene (brilliantly done) is not finished leaves an ambiguity that continues in the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is not in sight. Then, just when everything seems lost, it appears slowly and reunites with the family. The conclusion of Chance at the end speaks of the camaraderie that has developed between him and his companions on the trip, and the understanding of what really is the home of his long journey to get there, leaves a good epilogue to show how much he has grown your character. but also how the other two also have. Wait a second, I think I'm going to cry ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have not read Sheila Burnford's book, so I do not pretend to know where the differences between book and film are. lie. But this is a movie that the whole family can see, and although the little ones will love the talking animals, the older viewers will understand the plot better (as I discovered when I saw the film again after several years without seeing it). This movie is a masterpiece in the movies, and I suggest that if you have not seen it, go find it! <br /> <br /> And, please, avoid the sequel (see my review of Homeward Bound II!)
