Written by the writer who wrote the excellent series Murder Rooms that narrated the adventures of ACD with Dr. Joseph Bell, I expected this and I was not disappointed. It was quite slow, with much emphasis on Doyle's frustration with Sherlock Holmes, who was very precise and very well represented. It was an interesting study of characters and very well filmed (in digital video, unusual for a period piece). The acting was excellent in all aspects, particularly Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who played ACD, whose name I do not remember, did not impress me at all. An excellent character study that has approximately the same number of turns as any normal Sherlock Holmes case. Look at this if you have the opportunity
