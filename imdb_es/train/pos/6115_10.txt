Have you ever wondered how far a movie could go? <br /> <br /> Schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of the end with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is an aggravated writer, murderer and drug addict who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and madness. Directed by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist rubber doll, Harry begins his killing. <br /> <br /> From director Ron Atkins comes the first part of the vilest story that has been filmed <br /> <br /> The only other film I've seen similar to this would be the second installment entitled Schizophreniac Necromaniac <br /> <br /> This is a very low budget movie and it will not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something disturbing, different and horrible, this would be a good choice. <br /> <br /> DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE THE MODERN DAY HORROR (like Scream) <br /> <br /> Spectator discretion is recommended
