Initially I bought this DVD because I had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought, hey! another film starring Aishu and Shah Rukh, did not know that Aishwarya would only appear in an article number in the last quarter of the film in a song he shares with SRK and helps present his character who is in the film for only 15 minutes . Shakti is a film about the love and endurance of a mother. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, maturity, step to know and embrace the harsh realities of life. The article number in which SRK and Aishu appear has nothing to do with the film. In reality, it is a sequence of dreams that occurs while the drunken character of SRK is rendered unconscious by alcohol. She dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who one day shows up at her favorite meeting place, dresses sparsely and begins to seduce him. The title of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (loosely translated as "Love is a bitch!") And it's just steaming! Do not miss it
