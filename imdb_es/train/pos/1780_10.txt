My mother and I were on our way home after a trip to the northeast (mainly Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour to attend a film festival in Boston. Now, I do not know much about film, so I thought this could be a little educational. The first movie we saw was this, THE ROMEO DIVISION. Now, I do not know about you, but I thought this was great! I'm from Texas and where I come from we do not see too many movies, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted that it was too violent, but she said that she did not know much about what she was saying, but this was a great image. I was shocked by the fight sequences that were great. Also, I'm a big fan when the good guys win, so I got excited when Romeo's ladies killed all the bad guys. This was the true brilliance. I'm not sure when it will be released on video, but if you have the opportunity, you should check it out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. A word for the wise, however, is quite violent and there are many malicious words, so you may not want to let your children see. It's more for adults.
