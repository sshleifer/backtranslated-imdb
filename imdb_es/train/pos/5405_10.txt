My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We saw it like a couple of times and it was the best. Pity that a new Pokémon did not speak this time. I'll get used to it <br /> <br /> The masked Iron Marauder was pretty bad when he captured Celebi with his dark ball. The good thing that Ash and Sam managed to get out of their control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the final credits called Cele-BRATE played by Russell Velázquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever It became a hit since the three previous films and people will always love that movie.
