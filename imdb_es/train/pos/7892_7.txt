FREDDY has gone from being scary to fun, in this sixth installment of the series Nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's been 2 years, well, actually 11 since this movie took place in 2001. And FREDDY has killed all the children on Elm Street, except one, John Doe (Jacobb from part 5 , even the movie gives a clue as to who he is), in which he uses to bring more children to Elm Street. Not only FREDDY gets their wishes, but also receives their daughter returns to Elm street. When she discovers what is happening, she and other children decide to kill FREDDY once and for all. We can also see some of the mysterious backgrounds of FREDDY. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has been in contact with the series of nightmares for a long time. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. He tried to reveal what FREDDY was doing with his jokes ... COMDE and make the series more fun than terrifying. So this movie is really a common disease to talk about. It's not the speed of the series, part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
