This is an excellent example of the first talents of Bette Davis. The production is above the average for the period of 1936. I can not understand why the owners of the rights to this film have not put it on DVD. Owners, PLEASE, let go. I would buy it immediately. I have not seen it in more than thirty years, on television, but remember it well.
