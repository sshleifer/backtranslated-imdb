['For the urban cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the strongest alpha males ever on the big screen. He&#39;s a pretty decent kid who leaves his parents&#39; farm and heads to the big city of Dallas, where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to find him in the petrochemical industry. In 1980 it began to grow and Texas was definitely a growing place in the United States. <br /><br /> Travolta does a good job of making the public care about his character, which when it comes to that is a sexist pig. Meet and marry Debra Winger, who has the same origin, but has some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men. And when she hits him in Gilley&#39;s mechanical bull, a game of men, that&#39;s it for him. <br /><br /> Scott Glenn, who is an ex-con, works at Gilley&#39;s and this movie was his main role. It is a true snake in Urban Cowboy, it keeps Travolta&#39;s goat with a simple glance and moves towards Winger. Travolta, in turn, looks after the rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, who lives in Gilley&#39;s. <br /><br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was really a gigantic commercial for the biggest honky tonk in the world. Gilley&#39;s is no longer in the suburban community of Pasadena, Texas, but the memories are still alive. And the best of Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of the country / western songs that were presented in the film. I&#39;m not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but that&#39;s the only reason why I can think why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this film. I especially liked Johnny Lee&#39;s Looking for Love, if it was written specifically for this film, it&#39;s a disgrace that it has not been nominated for Best Song. <br /><br /> I liked the character of Debra Winger more in this movie. She does not lose a trace of femininity, but she confronts Travolta and does so with style. And this review is dedicated to that, however, as an unknown woman who will one day be the first woman in the career of Bull Riders.']
