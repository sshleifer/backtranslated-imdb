['If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This film presents sweet melodies, MJ as a robot and a crazy and disorderly plot. I remember, many nights, dedicating myself to this good feature film at the university, and reflecting on the amazing ghosts of whoever decided to give the green light to this ridiculous piece. <br /><br /> There is a lot of singing. A lot of dancing There is a lot of singing while dancing. MJ kills him as would be expected when it comes to this. But there is much more in this movie. There is claymation. There are fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit with which Michael Jackson has to battle in a dance (obviously also clay). There is also Joe Pesci (not made of clay). <br /><br /> RIP- we love you Michael! It is a sad day for all of us.']
