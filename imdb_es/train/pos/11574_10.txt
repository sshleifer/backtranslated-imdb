This movie is a documentary medium ... and it's quite interesting ... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... based on the real story of how a group of Norwegian Saboturs managed to stop the production of water heavy in Rukjan, Norway and the delivery of the rest of the heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and it could have been a little better ... the best part of The movie is that some of the saboturs are played alone! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of World War II and filming, this is a movie that is worth seeing!
