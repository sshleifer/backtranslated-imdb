Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how he does it. I read books constantly, but if there's a movie with Will Smith, I'll see it. He has a rare gift of getting into the movie and keeping you there. This movie is one of the best movies I've seen so far. I saw it on Saturday and I still can not get it out of my head. Incredible and sad all at the same time. Thanks again Will. You should watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie. You can not miss anything Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex and your man / woman sitting next to you so you can hug. WELL Worth the money you will pay to see it. Do not wait for it to appear on television.
