The movie that I thought was excellent, it was supposed to be a romance with a bit of suspense in between. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor. I do not know why people continue to give him a bad reputation. As for Mel Harris, she's a great actress and for those who think she looks too old for Rob, it's only for five years. <br /> <br /> Rob had a leading role in his own television series, as well as one in the series. Science fiction channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat, also known as Sweating Bullets and Jane PainKiller. <br /> <br /> He also starred in several movies for television and is now making a TV Mini series. <br /> <br /> They need to give you more main roles, which is what is best.
