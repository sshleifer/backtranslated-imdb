There are many reasons to see this movie: to see the reality that plagues Latin America with respect to kidnappings, police corruption on a continental level, among so many realities that Latinos live. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant, this guy is still an excellent actor and continues in this way. Dakota Fanning, only 10 years old, has become an excellent actress and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was great, I have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope that they happen to the producers of Hollywood to make a film completely in Venezuela, where they show better our reality with respect to the delinquency, the traffic of drugs or the political problems. There have been few films that play in Venezuelan lands (for example: Arachnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) that should do more, as well as in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The song "Una Mirada" I hope it comes out on the soundtrack, it's excellent. My vote is 10/10
