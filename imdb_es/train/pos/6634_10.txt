How can you not rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this movie is not very entertaining, but the goal is not to tell a story, but history! This is the first "real" movie in the history of cinema ("Le Prince de Galles" was the first but it was not technically perfect enough) and it has, without doubt, great international value. These people you can see at the end of their working day in the film had the opportunity to participate in a historical moment, and they became the first people to be able to be moved! And especially the shot is a beautiful shot! And it's very exciting when you think of the first people who have seen that! What a moment! Historical for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematograph for scientific reasons) and for art later. A movie to venerate!
