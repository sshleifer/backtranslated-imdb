Castle of Blood is a good example of quality work in the horror genre that was developed in Italy in the 60s. The film has all the right elements: the old dark house, the atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steele. Steele makes it worth watching any movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about an enchanted castle. People have visited, but none have returned. Our hero bets that he can spend the night in the castle and collect his winnings again. But, the night he visits is a special night. It is the night of each year when the dead return to relive their deaths. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I see in the movie is the execution time. It almost feels padded. There is a large part of the first act where, literally, nothing happens. Our hero stumbles in the dark without finding anything of interest. But once you find something, the movie starts and becomes quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is a definite must for fans of Steele and fans of Italian gothic horror in general.
