['I just saw &quot;Valentine&quot; and I have to say it was the best Slasher movie I&#39;ve seen in years. Unlike the recent trend of horror films of the 90s, this film is more concerned with being mysterious than making fun of itself. For those who hated &quot;Scream&quot;, there is no reference to &quot;the rules of horror&quot; in this movie (even though the rules of slasher movies apply here). <br /><br /> This is the perfect mix of horror from the 80s and 90s. You get the style, the cinematography and the good acting of the movies of the 90s and the madness of stalking an 80s movie. I guess the year 2001 will finally give you to horror fans the kind of movies they craved. This is definitely a movement in the right direction. <br /><br /> Denise Richards stands out here as a funny character. You can say that he liked his role, and that makes it stand out. I loved her in this movie.']
