This movie is very good. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and the Chinese fantasy movies, you should love this. This film is the Asian lord of the rings: a fantasy story, based on real Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics have called this film without a plot, I think they probably do not know Chinese mythology). If you liked the Stormriders or the Warriors of Heaven and Earth, this should be yours. This movie is still very hard to find in the USA. UU., Although it was purchased for distribution in the US. UU Along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Well worth the search! This DVD is also worth owning.
