I was very young when it came out in the United States, but I recorded it on TV and watched it again and again until I had everything memorized. To this day I still find myself quoting him. The show itself was hilarious and had many famous people, from Frank Sinatra, to Sylvester Stallone, to Mr. T. The voices were great, and they sounded like the characters they represented. The puppets were also well made, although a bit creepy. I was surprised to discover recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, a show that I also enjoy a lot. As another person had written in a previous comment, I also stole this great show a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I wish there was enough demand for this program to justify a DVD release, but I do not think there are enough people who have heard it. Oh well, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
