This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is an impressive job. Why it's not printed is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live images and tandem animation. This used to run as part of "Vault Disney" every few months, but I have not seen it on the list for quite some time. * Sigh * Most recommended.
