['I have always liked Kenneth Branagh&#39;s versions of Shakespeare&#39;s classics, since he always does a very good job, but in this film, whoever raises the whole movie, is none other than &quot;the always great actor&quot; Laurence Fishburne. Surely he has made some bad decisions in the movies, even though he is a wonderful actor, but in this truth we are given the real Othello: passion, the intensity of jealousy as they get stronger along with paranoia Well represented from Fishburne and, besides, they finally give us a black Othello! <br /><br /> I do not think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that mixture of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate and, not to forget, those burning eyes ...? Branagh is good as always, but not in its heyday, Desdemona de Ir√©ne Jacob is quite good but a bit somber, while Laurence Fishburne really picks him up and makes it into a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Look at it']
