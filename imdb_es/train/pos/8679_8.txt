If you are a fan, then you will probably enjoy this. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema are, this is not the movie to begin with. It's very cute, silly, the girls are attractive and it's fun to watch them. There is no sex at all until the end of the 45-minute film, but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot is not total boredom. Misty Mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair has uncomfortable braids, so it is not as sexy as it has been in others. But her panties on this are pretty cute (you'll just have to watch the movie so it does not sound really weird). If you like this one, you will probably enjoy "That 70's Girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit more graphic). If you prefer to see Misty or Esmeralda in less sexual films, more based on horror and exploitation (but with a lower budget), visit the Factory 2000 website.
