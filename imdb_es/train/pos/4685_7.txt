In "Love Crimes" by Lizzie Borden (1992), Sean Young plays a D.A. in atlanta It is a lonely woman who gets too involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes compromising photos of them and then abandons them. <br /> <br /> Naturally, this lonely loner decides to enter the life of the false insect pretending to be his prey, with the intention of bringing it to justice. They meet, they make love, and the next thing she knows is that she's on her lap, getting beaten up. (Note: The whipping scene is only in the "unqualified" version of this movie, the R-rated version omits it and other scenes that would make the plot more lucid). This psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudes and disturbing images. , like Bergin chasing one of his victims around the room, shaking it with a whip. <br /> <br /> Like a thriller, "Love Crimes" is at its best when Sean Young plays his cat and -game game with Bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. It is unfortunate that the film does not end, it simply stops. It is true. It is possible that the director Lizzie Borden has run out of history to tell, but after 92 minutes, the credits accumulate and we have a disconcerting "what just happened?" bewilderment. <br /> <br /> The development of Young's plan is developed with an attractive style, but the lack of a coherent ending will be a detour for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado@yahoo.com)
