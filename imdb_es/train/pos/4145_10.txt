This is not Masterpiece Theater. You should not go into that expecting that. This is pure fun of girls with the most fantastic cast of female protagonists. As someone else said here, this is the movie that Baby Mama should be. And the only drawback that I see in this movie is that Tina Fey was not in it, in addition to starring in the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. The movie is a simple nonsense on the surface, but if you really watch it you will know that it has many messages and a deep meaning for any of us who would like to be able to come back and do it again in life, knowing then what we know now. . PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
