The Road Rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the Master to fight crime around the world. The show was hilarious to say the least. Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages. Running jokes throughout the series that could breed a drinking game. The action was fascinating, and cleverly prepared. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what most made me enjoy the show was the depth of the characters. Each of them has struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but are implicit in the subtext. With luck, one day, there will be some way to see the Rovers in action again.
