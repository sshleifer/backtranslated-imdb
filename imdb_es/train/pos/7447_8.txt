Maybe the movie goes a little far, but if you like the show, it's what you expect. It is not a bad movie; Actually it's pretty good. If you do not like the program, do not watch the movie. It may start a little slow, but then it gets up and turns out to be pretty fun. There are even some "heartbreaking" scenes towards the end. After all the protagonists have gone through these scenes, they will come to you. In addition, Jerry expresses his opinion of why his program annoys people and justifies the existence of his program. It has a good point. We care so much about the private details of the lives of celebrities, so why is it wrong for these people to count their private lives on national television as well? If they were celebrities, we would not mind at all, we would eat them. Do not we like your guest to do this just because they are poor white trash and remind us that there really is poverty in this world and not just glamorous and rich movie stars who live in the world of "Leave it to Beaver"?
