In the book of the Citadel movie series The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a capo of a musical. I sure can not do better than that. It's such an important film in the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson did not do too bad either. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer had lent Gene Kelly to Columbia, where Harry Cohn was inspired to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and, therefore, Cover The girl became a classic. So, if Mayer did not learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did it and allowed Kelly artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh finished, Fred Astaire finally had a dance rival for the dance of the film monarch. <br /> <br /> The main issue that everyone talks to with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally, Kelly wanted to make the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney was not lending Mickey to anyone. Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit made an external movie. Do not worry because MGM had its own animated rodent in the middle of Tom and Jerry's team. <br /> <br /> Kelly, as a dancer, always tried hard to do something new and different on the screen, like Fred Astaire. For the next dozen years, these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work, even if the films themselves were not up to par. It was as if each one inspired the other to a bigger and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any number of other studies. At Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a little. In fact, Frank Sinatra always gave Gene Kelly credit for showing him how musicals should be done, as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning it, it's Oscar for From Here to Eternity. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra bought half of his contract bought in RKO by MGM, he insisted on a bit of artistic creativity on his own. He had become friends with the team of composers Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography, Sammy Cahn tells how Sinatra insisted that they write their songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer gave up and the team wrote some really good ballads for him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Love in Too Easily. Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano in an empty Hollywood Bowl. It's Sinatra at its best. <br /> <br /> With Jule Styne and then with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn earned the title of having put more lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than anyone else. They were lifelong friends and Cahn has always credited Sinatra with this milestone in his career. <br /> <br /> In a bet, Styne and Cahn said they could write a song with a chromatic scale. They showed it at Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings. He also made some classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Here the song is the basis of the plot. Two sailors on leave due to a combination of circumstances meet Kathryn Grayson and her orphan nephew Dean Stockwell. Trying to fix it with Sinatra, Kelly says he can get him an audition with Jos√© Iturbi. They pass the movie trying to achieve just that. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment at Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the waitress 'Brooklyn' never got a number. She had received rave reviews for her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood. I suspect he had a number that was cut and somewhere in the vaults of MGM could still be. <br /> <br /> Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals are no longer made. All that creative talent was under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If I had to pay a market value for it, the cost could remove the debt of a third world country. <br /> <br /> But the results of the film would be extraordinary.
