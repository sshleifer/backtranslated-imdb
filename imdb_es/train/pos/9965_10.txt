Perfect for families with young children who are looking for cheerful movies that do not contain violence and that captivate the child and that are fun, even if they are cheesy, for adults. It's not a bad movie for a low budget job. Children will be surprised by Santa's workshop and the "magic" that allows him to enter homes through chimneys that seem too small, or homes that have no chimneys at all. <br /> <br /> Children will get excited about Santa's success in frustrating the nasty demon named Pitch (complete in a classic red suit with horns and tail). They will sympathize with the poor girl, whose greatest wish is to have a little doll to love. And the poor rich kid who just wants to spend time with his parents always absent. And what child does not know someone at school who is like the nasty boys who are recruited in Pitch to help capture Santa Claus and ruin Christmas? In the end, everyone, including unpleasant children, gets what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> The film will make children fall in love with Santa and the message of love he transmits to people around the world. <Br /> <br />
