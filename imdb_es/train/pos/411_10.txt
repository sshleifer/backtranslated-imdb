This film is well done on so many levels that I am surprised that the score is as low as (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) at the time of writing this article). This movie has incredible special effects, a true epic story, a complex interaction of great characters and amazing battles: you have to see them to believe them! The only complaint I have is the subtitles in the DVD version of HK that I got (some lines were not translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I just do not understand when I read and hear from various sources: "it has a confusing argument ...", "I could not follow the story ..." or "The characters came from nothing ... " From the first time I saw this movie, I understood it, I followed it, I knew why the characters were there and I loved it! I've seen it about 8 times and every time it's pure pleasure. Oh, and this is not just my opinion, because I have shown this movie to many compatriots (people who have never seen a HK movie before) who feel the same. None of them did not follow the plot and each person declared their love for this film. Oh man, why can not we have things like this coming out of Hollywood? At least the Lord of the Rings had a good marriage of special effects, character development and history. <br /> <br /> This also does not come from a novice lover of the Asian movie. I have an extensive library of Asian films and I must say that this movie is one of my best DVDs. When you see it you will be surprised by the incredible special effects and the epic feel of this movie. You will be attracted to this fantasy world and you will not want to leave! I have seen the 1983 version and the 2001 version (both made by Tsui Hark), and the 2001 version is much better compared to the IMO. <br /> <br /> In addition to the subtitles, I have one additional complaint about this movie: I did not want it to end ... I beg you, Mr. Hark, can we have a sequel?
