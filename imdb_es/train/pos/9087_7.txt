The saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. He stays at the Hollywwod hotel (of course). At the same time, the great selfish star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new movie. In a panic attack, the studio hires Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to pose as her and have Bowers take her to the premiere, DO NOT tell her it's not Marshall. Naturally they fall in love. The rest of the plot you can do yourself. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (to put it nicely), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very nice couple and have beautiful singing voices. The score is good (highlighted by "Hooray for Hollywood") and the director Busby Berkeley shows his unique images in a very funny and drive-in musical sequence (with Edgar Kennedy making his patented slow motion). Also Glenda Farrell has some funny snippets like the sister of Monas Jonesie. <br /> <br /> Even so, the movie is not so good. The rest of the cast is fierce and most of the humor is not funny. Lola Lane, in particular, is lousy trying to play Mona for comedy. There is also racism: a black stereotyped maid plays for laughter and there is a truly frightening racist "humor" at some point. That's probably what keeps this off the television most of the time. I realize that it was accepted at that time, but today it is disgusting. <br /> <br /> In general, a regular movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs. I give him a 7.
