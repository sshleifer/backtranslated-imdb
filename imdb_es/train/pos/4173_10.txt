['A kind of road movie in the old-fashioned trains in the province of Slowenian at the end of summer. At first you see someone in his underwear sewing black cloth pants, and when the same young man with his black pants comes out of the house with two suitcases, you see that the part of the pants is missing in a flag of mourning (apparently his father has died) . On the train he meets a young woman, and almost without words, but with many small gestures, a wonderful love story begins. It is a film that is somewhat surreal, very poetic and a bit strange, with many strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful images with love for beautiful details.']
