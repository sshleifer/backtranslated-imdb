['This is by far the most incredible movie I&#39;ve seen in a long time. The actors gave wonderful portraits of the characters in the film. The story was accurately portrayed. The story begins with a young girl from the British Isles and her father traveling on a steamboat to Nauvoo, Illinois. She has become a member of the LDS Church and he has not. He thinks that she is ridiculous to make the trip and it is discouraging. She encourages him to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins. The film accurately portrays his life and part of the history of the LDS Church at the same time. It was graphic sometimes, but it was necessary. The emotional expression was very believable, which caused my emotions to spill out. The filming was incredible. The way the story was presented was moving. After the movie ended, we sat without being able to move. I was stunned. For people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, I encourage you to see this. If nothing else you gain a little understanding of your life. For those who are members of the Church, I encourage you to see it. It will increase your testimony of this most incredible man. This is a mandatory tour.']
