['<br /><br /> It is a generic story of coming of age: think of &quot;The wedding member&quot;, &quot;Summer of &#39;42&quot;, &quot;A summer place&quot;, even in &quot;Little Women&quot;, and there are times when Mulligan may have omitted Music with a lot of flavor, which is not used in slow motion or minimizes the golden beauty of the stage. Otherwise, it is done with a perfect and weird tone. Nothing is forced, each line has feelings, and the rhythm is correct. Even the cast below the A list helps: the bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities could have overwhelmed the material. In particular, Witherspoon is excellent: his line readings are fresh and original, and his body language is right for a 14-year-old girl on the eve of femininity. Waterston is also very good, even if he has to spend much of the movie going up and down the family truck. <br /><br /> One feels that the creators of the film were aware of their unpromising commercial promises, without big stars, without major car accidents or special effects, and consciously decided to make the best movie possible, curse the box office. It is intimate and honest, and sticks to the ribs. If you find yourself tarnished at the end, you do not have to feel cheated.']
