Stardust, very funny, very imaginative and fairy tale, all in one, Stardust tells the story of a young man who lives out of a fantasy world and will recover a bit of a fallen star to discover that the star is alive, She is young and beautiful. . A kingdom whose king is about to die has said that the king unleashed a competition with his several children to see who can retrieve a ruby ​​first to be king, while a trio of witches wants the star to separate and use to keep them young . These three threads of the plot intertwine in an intricate way throughout the whole image, combined with a good performance, dazzling special effects, and also some solid feeling and humor. Stardust is a fun movie and has some fun performances of characters like Claire Danes as the star (I could look at it for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could look at her with all her magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch Robert Deniro playing An air pirate from Nancy Boy to perfection. Charlie Cox as leader, Tristan is affable and credible, and we got a very good job from a group of boys who play the children to be king, who constantly try to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett play their roles well in both life and death (they also loved this thread). Peter O'Toole plays the dying murderer, dad, and watches the funny man Ricky Gervais, who made me laugh more than anything in the whole movie in his brief five minutes (pretty feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.
