I have seen this film criticized with the statement: "If you can surpass moralization ..." That is not understood. Moralizing is in the consciousness of the spectator, so to speak. This is a decent movie with a standard murder mystery, but with a different twist that emerges halfway. The resolution leaves the viewer wondering: "What would I have done in this position?" And I have to believe that that is exactly what the filmmaker intended. To that end, and to the extent of entertaining the audience, the film succeeds. I also like the way violence is never on stage, but only off camera. We know what just happened; He just does not serve himself in front of us, then rubs his face, as it would be today with contemporary blood and blood dressing. In addition, violence is not the point. The point is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, who is cleverly resolved, although in a disturbing way.
