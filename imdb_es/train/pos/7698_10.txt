But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang takes second place as a fight choreographer, only Sammo Hung compares it. This is immediately clear in his proud display of technique, instead of flashy camera angles, etc., during fights. The direction is tightly controlled to not only excite the viewer by speed and movement, but also to amaze her with the precise skill shown. This film also benefits from Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance at the banquet scene with which the film begins is one of the highest points in the history of the kung fu movie. Liu has the support of the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (from My Young Auntie fame) and 'Hsiao Hou', whose stunts are amazing and preferable to any amount of wiring. In regards to the plot, this film follows the common theme of revenge. but with character and moral development along the way, and a more adequate resolution. The humor in this is also the best. If you only see a kung fu movie, this would be a good option, it has everything.
