As far as I know, this program was never repeated on UK television after its original execution in the late '60s and early' 70s, and most episodes are now sadly "missing, presumably erased". <br /> <br /> Series 6 as of 1971, however, still exists in its entirety, and I recently had the opportunity to see it all, the best part of 4 decades later. <br /> <br /> After running out of school, Freewheelers was an essential activity for me and for many of my contemporaries in those days of bell-bottoms, Slade and Chicory Tip. And seeing him again caused a nostalgic lump in his throat. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if the evil / hammy acts, the involuntarily funny fight scenes, plan holes wide enough to fly a large oceanic yacht and the "frighteningly, frighteningly" RADA Accents of the main players. <br /> <br /> No, forget all that. Because Freewheelers goes back to a past childhood television drama (I dare to say "golden"), when the shows were simply fun and were not taken so seriously. Before they became obsessed with all the "ishoos" loaded with anguish that today's writers have their young protagonists concerned, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, STIs, etc. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt if it was "remade" for a modern audience "in these days of total political correctness, the figure of the boss would be a black woman, one of the young male heroes would be a Muslim, the other it would be a white boy confused about his sexuality and the girl would be a seeker of all kinds of action with an IQ outside the scale, which will always get the boys out of the scratches and make them look foolish, in other words, a million miles removed from the deferential afferent ankle, deferential, by Wendy Padbury. <br /> <br /> It's a show that is very "of its time." But is that a bad thing? For my part, I do not believe it.
