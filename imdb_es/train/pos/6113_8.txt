After having seen "Marry the Mafia", I almost lost my faith in the Korean film business. But this gave me back my faith. <br /> <br /> A female leading character who is a college student forced to teach the spoiled, rich but charismatic high school student. He is actually the age of the female character. Through some hilarious fights, these two end up being great friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that the newcomer Kwan sang woo did his job with excellence. It was a revelation !! Actress Kim has nul was also lovely as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie tried to avoid the clich√©s that can be seen in the typical romantic comedies. And he did not show us any unnecessary nudity, sex scenes. It was brilliant, charming, fresh, it made me want to see it again. <br /> <br />
