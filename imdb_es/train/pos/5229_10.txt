This movie has received horrible ratings from almost everyone who has voted here, but I'm here to tell you that if you like movies like Dude Wheres, my Car and Dumb and Dumber, this movie is for you. If you like movies like Citizen Kane and the identification of Casablanca, you have to suggest yourself in a different angle. However, I still love this movie and everything related to it, even if it is a kind of "child", this is one of the few films that my friends and I have been able to see over the years and always quote make it possible GREAT MOVIE. This movie should be number 1 of AFI because it is a high class. The only problem with this movie is that you may have trouble seeing it because it was made for a television movie on a channel that no longer exists. So I do not know how to get this movie, I would like to buy it for a DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. I still have it recorded from the first time, you can come if you want and see it, but I could be sleeping. This movie is cool and that's basically all you need to know.
