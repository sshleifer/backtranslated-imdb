This film has a special place in my heart, because when I saw it for the first time, I was teaching adult literacy. It sounded very faithful to me and even to an outstanding student I had at that time. There are scenes that make you swallow with sudden emotion, and those that even put a smile on your face through a total identification with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro that are classified with their best work, a great change of a young Martha Plimpton, an inspiring story and an unforgettable musical music that makes it the most pleasant experience and gratifying. .
