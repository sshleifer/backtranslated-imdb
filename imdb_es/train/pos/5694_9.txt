Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are great. I have seen Kilmer in The Doors, however, his portrayal of John Holmes is excellent. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was a bit slow. Wonderland is a movie that can show you a horrible crime story from the perspective of a guy who simply gets carried away by his drug addiction and indolent of what ever happens. At the same time, the character of John Holmes shows a very clever con man who can go through the most unpleasant and ugliest situations with almost no damage. The movie deserves to be seen more than once. The sensual and drug-filled atmosphere of the seventies is incredible.
