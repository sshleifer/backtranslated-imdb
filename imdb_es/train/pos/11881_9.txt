Every great gangster movie has secondary streams of human drama. Do not wait for an emotional story of "Scarface" guilt, retribution and desperation. This is a story of fierce greed, corruption and power. The darker side of the legendary "American Dream". <br /> <br /> Anyone who complains about the "cheesiness" of this movie does not realize it. The superficial characters, the cheesy music and the antiquated fashions feed even more the critique of this life of diabolic excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matters, at least not on a human level. In fact, the movie practically borders on satire, it's ironic if you consider all the gangsta rappers who were positively inspired by Tony Montana's lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This is not Brian DePalma's strongest management effort, sometimes it's excellent and it's fine. managed (particularly the memorable ending), but often sinks to careless and deceived. Fortunately, it is backed by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coca habit he was dealing with at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana and the evolution of his character as he consumes greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see and cut comfortably between humor and drama. There are many outstanding lines, which have since made their way into popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> The cast helps to do what it is too, but this is really Pacino's movie. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common to him today), this is a world completely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. However, it is as visible here as ever, in a very entertaining (and intentionally exaggerated) way. It's hard to imagine another Tony Montana after watching this movie, possibly in one of the most imitated performances in history. Pfeiffer stood out as boring and uncomfortable to see her for the first time, but I've noticed how she plays the boring wife's role. It is not an exceptional effort, but badly judged unfairly. The support players are also very good, particularly Paul Shenar as the soft Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking and continually controversial. "Scarface" is one of the movies of the eighties (whatever that means to you). An essential and accessible gangster film, and a landmark of pop culture. 9/10
