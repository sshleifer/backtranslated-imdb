The movie is more about Pony than Gray Owl. It is also about aborigines, Canada, English, the aunts of Gray Owl and the North Bay Nugget. Excellent story <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, more like a book, that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene is Gray Owl that admits his position before Pony and his reaction. <br /> <br /> Some observations on the ratings of users. Note that user ratings are bipolar groupings in 5 and 7; It is not for everyone, but it has many followers. This movie is underestimated and overlooked, but it will be noticed in the coming years. In addition, few women have seen the film, but they qualify it more than men. Has it been marketed correctly? <br /> <br />
