['To the great displeasure of his adult children and almost immediately after the death of Elizabeth&#39;s husband (Dame Judy Dench), the attic saxophonist, widower and attic, is inclined to return openly to his musical hobby. Now that George is dead, Elizabeth no longer has to practice saxophone in the attic. As she feels more pleased to play outdoors, Elizabeth strolls down the path of memory, remembering when she was 15 years old and was part of a jazz swing band, &quot;The Blonde Bombshells&quot;: supposedly, a group of talented girls from World War II. jazz musicians swing. One of the members of the band &quot;Blonde Bombshells&quot; was a womanizer and transvestite drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm), with whom Elizabeth was still a friend. <br /><br /> Both Joanna (Millie Findlay), the granddaughter of Patrick and Elizabeth, 12, press Elizabeth to reunite the former members of the band and play again together; This time as a group of sexagenarians. Among the members of the band he finds are the bass (still foxy!) Playing the bass, Madeleine (Leslie Caron); Dinah (Olympia Dukakis), a trumpet, alcoholic and lonely, divorced and widowed living from the wealth of her many (former) marriages in a Scottish castle Craigievar; Gwen, (Clio Laine, real-life American jazz singer), with the lead vocal; Annie, (June Whitfield), as the thrombones of the Salvation Army; Betty, (the late pianist, Joan Sims), who is training the ivory keys in a Hastings pub. <br /><br /> Like Elizabeth, Patrick and Joanna explore the world in search of members of the band of 1940 and try to convince them to act together again, Elizabeth often makes herself while learning more of what she wants to know about her adult life, including your own. while you have fun playing great music with the last of the &#39;Blonde Bombshells&#39; alive. <br /><br /> Entertainment entertaining, nostalgic, historical, sentimental, multigenerational that is really fun. The actors offer wonderful performances. Regardless of their age, they are still Bombshell artists who give a great show. (The DVD is now available and worth buying due to additional features and Dolby Digital sound.) Surely as a fan of any of these fabulous actors, the VHS is a collector&#39;s item.']
