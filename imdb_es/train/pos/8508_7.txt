Richard Dix decided to retire, so Michael Duane took his place playing the role of Ted Nichols, who meets a young French woman named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This couple only met for two days and decided to marry a Justice of the Peace (Judge) and it is raining when they arrive at the Judge's house and discover that he is not at home and will not return until the following day. When the couple is inside the house, you see someone pick up the hood of their car and take a part of the motor car. Once you see that this event is happening, you realize that this couple will take a big surprise and the story begins to reveal a very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley, and poor Ted Nichols begins with many problems and without marriage . Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
