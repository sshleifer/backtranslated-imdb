['As a fan of Bette Midler, I must say that her live concerts recorded are my favorites. Bette thrills us with her jokes and makes us cry with her ballads. A literal rainbow of emotion and talent, Bette shows us the best of her solid repertoire, as well as the new songs from the album &quot;Bette of Roses&quot;. Encompassing generations of people, she offers something for everyone. The one and only Divine Diva demonstrates here that she is the most talented interpreter in the world.']
