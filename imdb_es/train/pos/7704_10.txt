Certain elements of this movie are dated, of course. A completely white male team, for example. And like most Pre-Star Wars science fiction, it tends to take too much time admiring itself. <br /> <br /> But, still, no film has captured the taste of the Golden Age Science Fiction as it did, not even downward. For the use of "electronic tonalities" to provide the musical score. Robbie, the robot, personified the Asimov robots, and was the inspiration for everything that followed, from C3PO to Data. <br /> <br /> The plot, of course, is "The Tempest" by Shakespeare. Morbius is Prospero, and the exiled magician who finds his kingdom invaded by intruders ... It was a film that treated science fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
