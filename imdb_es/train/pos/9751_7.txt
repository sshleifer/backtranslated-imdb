['ONCE AT A TIME, there were different types of movies. These different films coexisted despite the fact that each had something different to offer ... <br /><br /> This seems obvious at first, but I thought I would point it out during this review because it seems that some people may have forgotten it. This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. That&#39;s all it is. It does not pretend to be something else or something grander. People who make fun of him as something that did not fulfill a promise are not seeing the whole picture, literally. After all, Hollywood makes movies all the time that are embarrassing vehicles for people (Bodyguard or The Preacher&#39;s Wife with Whitney Houston are two examples that come to mind). <br /><br /> First I would like to approach the film as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world ... and worse movies. The singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. The film begins with Schubert&#39;s Ave Mar√≠a and then with Matina de Leoncavallo. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular music such as &quot;I left my heart in San Francisco&quot; and the song that was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe, &quot;If we were in love&quot; w / music by John Williams and lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman, the 3 previous Oscar winners. <br /><br /> The story is not so bad. It was built for Pavarotti, so, of course, it will not be something that is profoundly or universally applicable to the average movie viewer. It is the story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago. When asked to sing again in the same place, the &quot;MET&quot; in New York, he lost his voice out of fear. Dr. Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)) played by Kathryn Harrold, gives her an injection to cure her psychosomatic reaction. He offers her the opportunity to have an affair with him and she reluctantly agrees. <br /><br /> They embark on an adventure, she knows that he is married and promises that she will not fall in love with him and that he will think that she will only be another woman. In spite of all that, they fall in love (therefore, the song, &quot;IF we were in love&quot;) and with their help, he overcomes his fear and returns to MET where he triumphs. I will not say how it ends, but it is quite predictable. Which is not always bad. <br /><br /> The performances in this are not so bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if he is expecting a performance by Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks, YOU are cheated, not Pavarotti. He knows that he is not a theater actor. What he is is cute, charming and charismatic. He is having fun himself, and if you can have fun too, it&#39;s not so bad. A funny phrase is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is a &quot;thirsty plant, Fini can laugh!&quot; and, of course, she says: &quot;I do not want to be watered by Fini!&quot; Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a good job as a semi-tense woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the movie is: &quot;Life never has to be life-size.&quot; And there&#39;s Eddie Albert, who does his usual good job as manager of Fini. There are several &quot;own&quot; cameos of true directors, singers, etc. and it was shot on location at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. <br /><br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you can just let go and enjoy a &quot;little adventure&quot; as proposed in the film, then you can enjoy this movie as it is. I know, EVERY time. :) <br /><br />']
