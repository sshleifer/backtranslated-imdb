This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart movie, witty, charming and very nice. The performance of Kim Novak as Gillian, the beautiful witch who longs to be human, is splendid, her subtle facial expressions, all her movements and gestures create the unique and unique character of Gillian. Disquieting character, he left us hanging each of his words. You should not miss the highly commendable performances of Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester as the Scottish-loving writer obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and the latter as the adorable aunt who can. It seems you do not stop using magic, even when it is prohibited The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are very well done and the chemistry between them is great, but again, when the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any protagonist is bad!
