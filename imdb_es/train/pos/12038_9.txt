Yes, a true classic! This is about British drama, realism and the minimal use of special effects (and inflated budgets). The last time I saw this drama was the last time it was screened on British terrestrial television in 1994. It should really be seen by everyone who likes a terrifying plot, no big names but no great acting. Apparently, the copywrite is now owned by someone. unknown and, as such, it is unlikely that this great drama will be transmitted soon. I myself recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS, so now, once again, I will be able to enjoy this great British drama. You must try and enjoy it too! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
