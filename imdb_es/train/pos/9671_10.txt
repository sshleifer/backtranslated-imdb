Paulie is the fantasy of a smaller girl or maybe her memory of what her youth was like when she was a child. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub performs an impeccable performance as a Russian scientist (PhD) who can not find decent work in the United States. He befriends an isolated parrot while performing the significant duties of a janitor in a behavioral science laboratory. <br /> <br /> The main doctor is a bitter man, since Paulie, who can speak and fully understand the language and learn, embarrasses the doctor. , who then expels him to the lower levels of the building, where Mikail (Tony S.) finds him. <br /> <br /> Paulie retracts her life with Marie and how they got lost. The search begins to reunite Paulie with Marie, only more than 20 years have passed. <br /> <br /> The movie ends, some will say predictably, with Mikail reuniting Paulie with Marie. The story closes with the three who enter Marie's house, where you can make the final choice. <br /> <br /> Great family movie!
