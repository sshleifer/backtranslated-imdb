['This is a beautiful and sad story of cultural difference. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who has run to California to escape a failed relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese-American manual worker with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner. Kyoko &quot;marries&quot; Ken so she can stay permanently in the US With the understanding that even if they live together until she gets a &quot;green card,&quot; the marriage will be in name only. Soon it is discovered that the parts are not in the same wavelength, or perhaps in the same &quot;time zone&quot;, hence the title of the movie. As an immigration lawyer, I have seen how these &quot;arrangements&quot; take on a life of their own, so I was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.']
