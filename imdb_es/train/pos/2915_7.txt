Bunny comes home 'This Man's Navy' deserves more credit than it deserves, a clever screenplay by Borden Chase, directed by 'Wild Bill' Wellman. The film has the right feel for the euphoria and goodwill of the beginning of World War I, and none of the blind Terror that came into play a few years later. Produced in 1944, the defeated Japanese, the battle scenes a little déjà vu, the melancholic attraction of Tom Drake by the radiant young Jan Clayton has a solid chemistry, plays real and validates Drake's career in Metro. The following year, Jan opened on Broadway in 'Carousel'. Wally Beery, a bit with cloudy eyes, boasts of an always incredible incredulous Jimmy Gleason. His memories improve with respect to reality and give Beery a shadow similar to that of Ulysses to play against. Shots of the Navy LTA (Lighter Than Air) are authentic, photographed in Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 squadron is out of the March Air Base. Lot 3 doubled for India, and U-turn for Bunny. Bunny comes home? he returns to Beery an authentic part of his past, something he had wanted to believe was true? So, the future in which we turn is fantastic? now on a larger scale, a newly designed Navy LTA with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance aircraft? How expensive, happily optimistic? even so, "you have to believe in that, is that how you make things come true?"
