Several posters have commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long and complex dramas. Crime is essentially banal, so the reward is always anti-climatic, while detailed exposure detracts from human drama. The writer has used a series of intelligent devices to try to solve this, but has not had total success. It responds exactly to what happened and why it may have been supplied, but if so, they are well buried. The viewer, inevitably, feels a little cheated. <br /> <br /> But in a certain sense this is not important. The drama was never about crime, not even about research, but about the impact of events on the lives of those involved; The family, the investigators, the witnesses, the press. And as such it was exciting. The writing was a significant cut over the execution of the drama for the prime time, and the performances were uniformly good. In a piece as a whole, it is a bit daring to focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary force of strength such as mother, wife and daughter, and Janet McTeer was in top form as an old policeman and scathing. <Br /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of the race, like the elephant in the room that nobody is willing to mention. Subtle, powerful things.
