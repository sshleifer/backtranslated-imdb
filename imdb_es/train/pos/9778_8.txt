This is a trio of stories, "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali", about an experimental commune (or something like that) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which led people to take trips within themselves and to Kingdom of Unknown, and I left some damage here and there, I would say. Many years later, part of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, was torn to pieces, and the suspect was a man who may not have existed. It seems that this woman is capable of projecting some inner demon, or so she discovers the sister of the man who was killed when she tries to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin". He is a shaved head, a fanatic of speed, and is sent to see a psychiatrist who turns out to be a former member of this commune, which makes a good doctor help the young man to fulfill his desire. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer, who tries to "cure" this woman who was part of this commune and releases a kind of demon that has lived in this woman, but one wonders if she did it or if she let him go because I could survive in it. All three of these stories are pretty creepy and full of suspense because you're never really sure what to expect, and the premise and settings are so different from those of conventional horror movies that add to the strangeness. This has a low budget appearance, but it also manages to evoke a rather spooky atmosphere at all times. I watched this with my mouth open a good part of the time and when the real fear (and blood) came it was very strong. I thought it was a very interesting and disturbing movie and I liked it a lot. A good find, this one, would give 8 out of 10.
