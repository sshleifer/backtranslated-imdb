This is your typical gay and colorful MGM musical from the early 50's and it is definitely one of the best things to see. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by genre expert Vincente Minnelli and starring Gene Kelly. The main advantage. Both made enough films together in those days, of which this is probably the best known. <br /> <br /> The film itself really managed to win the Oscar for the best film of the year, which meant that it surpassed films like "A Place in the Sun", "A Streetcar Named Desire", "The African Queen "", "Quo Vadis", "The blue veil", "The death of a salesman" that year, a real achievement, of course, but at the same time also a little too much credit for this charming, brilliant and entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When you see this movie you will surely be entertained with everything, which is also thanks to the movie, its beautiful color appearance and the many nice characters in this movie. it's not a big surprise when you have people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work. <br /> <br /> But really, could not you have done everything that was said in this movie in less than an hour or I mean, we already know where the movie is going, but still, rule to lengthen it as long as possible. It's not that I make the film drag anywhere, it just makes it a little longer. The movie could also have been done definitely with a few less musical numbers. <br /> <br /> One of MGM's best musicals, which however is not without its flaws. <br /> <br /> 8/10
