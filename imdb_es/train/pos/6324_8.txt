These guys are anything but the usual suspects! They are a group of friendly friends whom you want to see who get away with it, but they are so unfortunate that there are very few possibilities to do so. No one is better than William H. Macy in portraying the man with a big heart but dejected. in your luck This is probably his best performance since Fargo. Sam Rockwell played perfectly with the meathead boxer, and the rest of the gang was also uniformly good. Luis Guzman brought a great comic relief like Cosimo, and George Clooney stole every scene. his cameo role. The scene of the robbery at the end was absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The address was also successful by the Russo brothers. Without a doubt, there was a feeling of the Coen brothers throughout the film and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers. They have a long way to go to match the Coens, but this is an excellent start and I look forward to their next celluloid outing. ....... "I mutha is a whore"!
