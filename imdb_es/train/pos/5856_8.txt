Classified E (Contains Violence). <br /> <br /> I had the original Spiderman PC game for a couple of years. I still have not beat it because in Windows XP there is a failure at a level that can not be overcome by that. Be careful if you have XP. But for those who do not have XP, try this game. It is a family game, fun and clean, with action and is ideal for any fan of the Spiderman. In the game played by Spiderman and you face several criminals who commit crimes. Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to any Spiderman fan or a father who wants a fun and clean game for their children. <br /> <br /> 8/10
