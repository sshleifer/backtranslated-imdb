I love watching this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about raptors. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts are those in which the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the movie on Friday the 13th with the girl who eats the banana. <br /> <br /> I really love seeing this movie a lot because the computer graphics seem a bit fake, but it's fine because once you get into the movie you barely realize what's going on and I think that It has a good ending even though I did not really understand what was going on in me. The first visits to the couple I discovered over time and that is the important part. The other important part is how scary dinosaurs can be if you see them for the first time. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE.
