This film is an interesting version of the murderous scarecrow genre: surprisingly, it manages to rise and become larger than the sum of its parts. The scenes of average assemblies, the teenagers of 30 years and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the "new waves" of modern classics. As a spectator, I came out of the movie with the same sense of "shock and awe" when I first saw The Godfather in 1969. Judy Tiffany Gardner's amazing performance in bankruptcy deserved her Grammy nomination, which was well documented. by Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, none of the sequels could be up to the expectations (unlike the Godfather series, which improved with each installment and should culminate in 2012 with Godfather 4: Eat My Rage).
