In some way, this film manages to be invigorating, bittersweet and comforting at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring the story to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a life of despair, of ups and downs through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird. <br /> <br /> Paulie begins her life as a baby parrot given to a girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl) with a speech impediment. While she learns to speak correctly, Paulie also. However, unlike most birds, he can talk and understand everything that is said. The military father does not like the bird, so he is sent to a pawnshop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy. She teaches him manners, etc., as he travels across the country to find Paulie's owner. The film continues with several twists of fate, until Paulie ends up in a laboratory where he is finally hidden in a basement and found by a Russian custodian, who is moved by the story of the bird. The plot is in line with the simple and metaphorical theme that language is a gift and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is amazing. A beautiful mix of flute, digital base and horns enhances the film to the point of pure ecstasy. The wide angles of the camera and the stunning scenery embellish the story even more. And, as a final observation, the puppets are totally credible. (Unlike in Star Wars, where Yoda looks like a Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite movies, with the additional comment that my wonderful four-year-old parakeet died recently. In general, I give this movie **** four stars, two thumbs up and a big hug.
