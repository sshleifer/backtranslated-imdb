One of my favorite movies of all time, ever. Simply beautiful, full of human emotions, wit, humor, intelligence. The story grows, just like the lesson of life, just a wonderful movie in many ways. <br /> <br /> The cast is also fantastic ... a great selection of the best British talents that exist. I loved them all for every different element included in the movie. <br /> <br /> Italy has to be one of the most romantic places to create a story like this, everything about this movie works. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
