As the celebration of Christmas has evolved through the years, whether one concentrates on religious or secular traditions, it is a time when people should behave a little better each other. That has somehow happened to an Ebenezer Scrooge, merchant and moneylender in the 19th century in London. <br /> <br /> As his nephew tells his uncle, he does not keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels the whole thing. es humbug Humanity in Scrooge was expelled a long time ago, it is a difficult case, very similar to its counterpart of the twentieth century, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But as Charles Dickens told this story, Redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how. <br /> <br /> A Christmas story is a Christmas classic so timeless that we sometimes forget that it is as much a nineteenth-century social commentary in Britain as Oliver Twist was. The characters in this movie are middle and low class. The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street in Oliver Twist, but they have to fight to stay there. Still love and happiness radiate home, not thanks to the type for which Bob Cratchit works. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who did a lot of good in his life and just had to remember how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake-up call about the potential he still had to do something good in this. The old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart in his live performances and in the filmed work has taken over Scrooge. But George C. Scott captures the old miser pretty well in this movie. The evil of him, but with a trace of sadness that makes us encourage him to change. Scott joins a good tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, who have made great interpretations of Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting roles, I particularly enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a cordial and severe Spirit Christmas gift. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this is one of the 32 versions of A Christmas Carol that have been archived and is one of the best.
