['The Peter Jacksons versions are better films in general from the objective point of view. Having said that, they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings, and let me explain why. <br /><br /> First, the acting of the characters on the screen is too ordinary and unattractive with Jackson&#39;s LOTR. The whole cast is too current from the mill. &quot;Are you saying that those silly cartoon characters from Ralph Bakshi&#39;s version are better actors than real people?&quot; one might ask Well, they are not really stupid (except for the Hobbits, later on them) and they certainly have more personality than the Jackson party, even with a much more limited dialogue time. And that is due to the superiority of the voice function of the Bakshi LOTR. Take Aragorn for example. In this version, his voice is deep and charismatic, full of authority (Aragorn the Lord) and with an experienced rasp (Aragorn the ranger). This is due to the brilliant performance of John Hurt&#39;s voice. Compare that to the rather sharp sound of Viggo Mortensen without a soul and the duel quickly becomes unequal: Herir beats Mortensen. <br /><br /> And then there is Gandalf. Probably the most dominant character (and the most popular) in the entire saga. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf (William Squire) is a true magician. And with that I do not mean that he shoots rays of his fingers (he does not), but his presence is simply captivating. He is a mystic, powerful and can go from being a kind elder to a terrifying person with ease. Add to that his appearance: tall, old as old oak, beard as long as his body, sharp eyes, magic hook nose and, of course, the classic magician hat. A perfect Gandalf, as in books. Ian McKellen&#39;s Gandalf, on the other hand, is simply too boring. He seems too human, he sounds too human, he acts too human and he does not wear a hat or wield a sword. Yes, a sword. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf gets a pair of bloody orcs that kill with his sword (as he did in the books). And those are slow-motion mates with Gandalf style is not a power that you have to get into. And it should be borne in mind that, while I am sad to say this, the great Christopher Lee did not give life to Saruman. Fraser Kerr in this movie did it, even with a very limited time and screen lines. <br /><br /> Before going completely to the visual aspects of the film, it should be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presentation of the Orcs are also superior to the evil aspiring Jackson. The orcs of Bakshi make fun of their enemies (or between them) constantly with grunts, shouts and unpleasant language. In my opinion, they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book. And finally, the Black Riders - or the Nazgul. Those bad guys are ultimately frightening ghosts in this, not just some riders dressed in black. And they speak with a disturbing voice, which hypnotizes their victim. My favorite scene in the movie is when the Nazgul chase Frodo near the river. While Peter Jackson could not do anything but show the runners simply chasing the party, Bakshi throws a nightmare dream with some cold scenes in slow motion and a thunderous sky. <br /><br /> But as much as I like this movie more than Jackson&#39;s, the latter are, if only technically, even better. And that is due to some key images. As you know, Bakshi LOTR presents a mix of animated characters (all the hobbits and the main cast) and real actors covered in paint. I have no problem using real people in animation in this way, but they just do not fit very well with traditional cartoon figures. This is especially true in the case of humans (Riders of Rohan, taverns, etc.). Orcs are a different matter, since they are meant to be very different from other characters. The orcs, while being played by humans with a mix of animation, look much better than the Jacksons version. They have a brownish green skin, bright red eyes, a flat face and pointed teeth. <br /><br /> The biggest mistake in this movie, the visual effects, are the Hobbits. Although I prefer almost all the characters in Bakshi&#39;s version compared to Jackson, the latter has clearly superior Hobbits, in fact they are perfect. With Bakshi you get some disgusting and badly drawn humanoid Disney bambies. And you&#39;re forced to spend a lot of time at the movies with them, so be careful. Again, the voice acting is also fine with them, but the mouths of the actors can not save the &quot;immersion damage&quot; caused by these little weasels. Well, I never liked those halflings anyway. <br /><br /> The general flaws in Bakshi&#39;s script are well known. Limited play time (with limited budget) and many missing scenes. So, while this film covers almost half the story, it does not do it in great detail compared to Jackson&#39;s version. <br /><br /> In a summary, Ralph Bakshi&#39;s version of LOTR has a superior: <br /><br /> - General atmosphere (it looks more like Middle Earth) - Voice acting in general - Music (I really like the fantasy score of Kont &amp; Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One of the best roles of John Hurt) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond (He&#39;s not a fairy hippie in this one!) <br /><br /> While Jackson&#39;s version is better: <br /><br /> -because it covers the whole story -vigitales and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /><br /> Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, even with his notorious flaws, is one of the best animated films ever made and captures the atmosphere of Tolkien&#39;s fantasy world very well, if not perfectly. I will give you a score of 8Â½ out of 10.']
