I thought that the children in the show did a very good job. I especially enjoyed the performance of Emma's character. Well done! The tricks were pretty good for a low budget show. I was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burn of it. The ghostly apparitions of the souls of the liberated children were also good. Another good point of the film is that it kept moving forward. There were not many slow scenes. The adult drivers were also credible and, therefore, they helped keep the show entertaining. In general, a nice night of watching movies.
