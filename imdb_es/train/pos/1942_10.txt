I consider myself a great movie buff. I was sick on the couch and I exploded in this movie. From the opening to the end, I watched these great actors with amazement, I had never seen them, not a word. The filming was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hope this message is heard on any bad comments written by others. The director has a heart and beats with his actors along. Thanks for making a movie like this. Simply wonderfully awkward, beautiful and kind characters that are imperfect and funny at the same time. Just great I can not send this without a total of 10 lines, so I'll just say I want more from this director, more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer. I did not want it to end. The end
