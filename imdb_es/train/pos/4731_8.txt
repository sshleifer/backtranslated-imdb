This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Few actors are able to interpret the Stoic as Jet Li. The action is fast fire, and special effects increased for intensity purposes. As a result, it can take Americans a little off guard. A little suspension of disbelief long ago in a movie by Jet Li. I think it's an excellent introduction to Jet's work and I hope other masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) will hit the US market. A good mix of weapons game and physical conflict will satisfy most action movie enthusiasts.
