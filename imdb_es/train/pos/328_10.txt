Fascinating, I approached I Am Curious (yellow) and is a piece that accompanies me with great concern. He had read numerous reports on his widely publicized controversy and his explicit sex. What I got was not this, but a captivating and totally thought-out cinematic experience, like no other. I sincerely believe that the majority of the commentator who felt that the movie was 'lame' or 'boring' approached the film as if it were pornography. Maybe this is pornography, assuming that pornography is something meant to stimulate the senses, but it is intentionally not erotic. Lena, the protagonist, puts everything into her performance, giving her a realistic and human touch that is simply convincing and lasting. Her breasts may be drooping, her nipples unusually large, her thighs fat and her face chubby. But at the end of the film, the audience identifies with it and accepts their faults as humans. This touch gives even more credibility to the need. If the director had thrown a Briget Bardot bomb, the effect would have been nullified. I can not recommend this suggestive piece anymore. Get ready to think a lot about this movie of deliberate rhythm. The patient and unpretentious viewer will be completely rewarded in the way that most other movies could dream of.
