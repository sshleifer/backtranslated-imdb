I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier, it's an excellent series of fan fiction movies and I can not wait to see more. I just started watching this series of movies last week and I can not have enough. I have already recommended it to other people to see it, since it is worth seeing. I've seen each episode many times and I'm waiting to see more episodes coming out. I rated it with a ten, but I think it deserves a 12 loll. My congratulations to the staff of Star Trek Hidden Frontiers in an excellent job. If you like Star Trek, I recommend watching this Star Trek movie. The detail associated with this series of films is excellent, especially the ships and planets used in it.
