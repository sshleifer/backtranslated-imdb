Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had a very inconsistent policy in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represented the hypocrisy and the madness of the United States and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, "Merrill's Marauders" described the war as the necessary hell and "Pickup on South Street" It's about the dangers of communist spies. All his films offer a very entertaining visualization, and although he was often pigeonholed as a filmmaker, Fuller was as good as any of the leading studio contractors. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception and, despite the issues of date, the cinematographic style is far ahead of its time. It is also a very fast, tight and sometimes brutal rhythm of cinema. <br /> <br /> The performance in all areas is fantastic. Richard Widmark becomes a great antihero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend. The thief of the show is Thlema Ritter, however, in an absolutely charming performance as a stool cop. The angles that Fuller uses are great, which makes the acting sequences even more exciting and brutal (this is very violent for his time). The camera moves continuously like Tarantino and his school would do it forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great fast-paced thriller. "Shock Corridor" is still my favorite movie of Fuller, but this is a very close second. (8/10)
