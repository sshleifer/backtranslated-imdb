Now here is a movie taken from my childhood, which my family used to record. but in a way it was taken advantage of and lost over the years. Now I was fortunate to see the full movie on youtube.com; I loved this wonderful movie when I saw it as a child, and after seeing it again (online), I still do it today. My favorite song of the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I will always remember that sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (about who cheered whom), that some of the animators go back to the 1930s (WOW! That's like 47 years).
