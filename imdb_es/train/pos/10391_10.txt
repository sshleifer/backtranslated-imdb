It is very rare that a film attracts spectators of all ages: children for a good narrative and a wonderful and colorful production, and, for adults, for a script that knows how to read and write, values ​​of good production, good casting / performance, all bound. Along with a good Rozsa score. Two approximately contemporary films achieve this: "Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Part of the background story of this production is fascinating. This production, which began in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood and proved to be a cover for British intelligence efforts. The producer, Alexander Korda, was knighted in 1942. This is a unique case of intersection between art, commerce and politics! By all means, secure a good CD of this movie for your library!
