['Rod Serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, playful and creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and television examples in that state of development. There are no such shows now, but rather whores &quot;Housewives&quot; like Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful stabs of humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens. <br /><br /> Jack Elam entered the episode with such precision of acting and with his usual madness that I can not stop thinking that Rod Serling was adapting the program of the previous week to Elam, although it was an auxiliary element of the flow of history. This episode ends with a twist, as usual, but the shock and humor are mixed with a skill especially &quot;serlinga&quot;. <br /><br /> Rex Lewis Field']
