This is an extremely dense, somber and complicated film that unravels very slowly, revealing unbearable details, such as the attention paid to a novel, and watching this movie "ES" as seeing how a novel develops. While I was not interested in the narrator, as I felt I was out of balance with the rest of the performances, this film presents some of the best overall performances I've seen, and the protagonist, Summer Phoenix, is fabulous. Their innocence and ingenuity may seem unlikely, a kind of cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy that review, but it's still fabulous, partly because it does not look like anything I've seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly beautiful, filmed by Eric Gautier, and part of what is so special. This movie is like it never shows what you expect. It is always surprising, and despite its duration, the film never reveals more than it needs. At 163 minutes, it is extremely concise, in my opinion, one of the wonders of this film. It is full of brief moments that are simply stunning, some of the best that you are likely to see all year, and all these moments add up to the end of an extraordinary cinematic experience. The family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what this movie has to say about the theater has not been seen in the movies since Cassavetes' "Opening Night", or maybe "Limelight" by Chaplin. But, believe it or not, this movie is much "less" conventional. I never knew where this movie was going, and now, after having seen it, it still has multiple possibilities. This is a powerful movie, incredibly provocative.
