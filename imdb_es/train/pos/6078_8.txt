I especially loved that in this movie, Othello himself had dark skin and Desdemona did not have blond hair as usual. The cast played very well too, and I liked the script that faithfully follows the original text of Shakespeare. But I must say that some scenes were acting too erotic for a character like Desdemona. I have always thought that she is very modest, and that is why it is not right to show her in bed with Cassio, although it only happened in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona showed up so openly. But in general, I liked the movie and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.
