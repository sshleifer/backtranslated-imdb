My observations: the vampire costume at the end is dazzling and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette got along well, and came to equal the naive Nelson. The boat that crashed against his balcony served him well. The suits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. The costume designer of 1942 did a great job. Main theme of the song simply charming. <br /> <br /> Caution with negative posters: 1942 was the time of World War II; Pearl Harbor happened the year before. The United States has just come out of the Great Depression; I needed to go out and spend that hard earned money on the deviation of singing, dancing and yes, fantastic fantasy. The despotic dictators tried to discard there in RL, ending the freedoms. Thank God, the public had these fantastic plot movies to attend. The filming of films was a privileged pleasure in those depressing times. When you, as a negative poster, you become an actor or even a movie star, YOU have room to talk and criticize. The films of Jeanette and Nelson stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> Angel wings wonderful, in the true angel. The wings of RL at the costume party are not so attractive, but great for Jeanette considering the SL. <br /> <br /> The beautiful singing of Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Dancing Jeanette was a pure delight. <br /> <br /> 15/10
