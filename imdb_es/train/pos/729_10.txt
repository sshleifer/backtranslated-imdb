I really love this movie, I never tire of seeing it. The only line that I really can not stand is when Riff calls himself a teenage lobotomy, but other than that, everything else is perfect. I've never been a fan of PJ Soles and it did not help to hear that she did not even know who the Ramones were until she filmed this movie, but I can ignore her little face for the most part. Most people who see this again and again are fans of the Ramones and really ... that's the only reason why I love it so much. I never tire of seeing DeeDee ruin their Pizza or Joey lines ruining the teacher's name over and over again, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is watching them sing, you want to dance, walk the halls of high school ... I love it. The special DVD edition has a good retrospective, surprisingly PJ Soles is not in it. Maybe she was working on another project * laugh * Anyway, a great movie, even better if you're a Ramones fan.
