My Take: makes use of his family plot with excellent performances and some genuine moments of emotion. <br /> <br /> The plot is familiar. They frame an innocent man for a plot to assassinate the president of the United States, the first traitor in the Secret Service of the United States. While his secret service colleagues chase him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course, we know he's innocent, and the real culprit is right around the corner, but he was still entertained with THE SENTINEL. In this era in which the thrillers are reduced to being too absurd and abundant in the action sequences, THE SENTINEL is a good complement to all those good old-fashioned political crime thrillers. The family plot is elevated by exciting sequences and excellent performances. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the perfect man for the job, is Pete Garrison Secret Service agent, who is framed for being part of a plot. Assassinate the president. Former secret service colleagues (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) chase Harrison as he tries to find out who is behind the possible murder and the traitor in the Secret Service. This leads to many chase scenes that, surprisingly (and fortunately), are never incredible. The script also offers a secondary argument in which Garrison has an affair with the First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, this was not unnecessary, since most subplots are for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> The director of the film is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.) who makes the film look good. Although many have criticized it as "it should have been a television movie," I must disagree. Okay, this is not a perfect movie, and a lot of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigues like IN THE LINE OF FIRE or an episode of the TV series 24 (this movie is very similar to the style and the star Sutherland), but even so, this film takes its plot to great heights and does not abandon even its small details. The performances are spectacular (with a cast of first category, it is meant to be, even with the script of by-the-numbers. <br /> <br /> In general, I award it *** 1/2, it's not perfect, but not far from it. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
