First of all, let me say that I wanted to see this movie for about a year because I knew that Angelina Jolie was in it and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie. Anyway, video stores did not allow it, but the local library did. I saw it and I loved it. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was done well and fun. It was not degrading in any way. <br /> <br /> Each actor and actress did an excellent job. I laughed a lot because of the sexual humor. In general, I think it's worth watching this movie if you can find it. It's adorable and just fun to watch. I rarely rate movies with a 10, but I give it a 10! <br /> <br /> Go find it and see it!
