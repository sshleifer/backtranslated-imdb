It seems that I never write a review on IMDb unless I am extremely surprised at how good or bad a movie is. This movie falls into the first category. Every year, I try to see all the nominees for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars, even those that I know I will not like. "As it is in heaven" seems to fit perfectly. The plot sounds sugary, sentimental and slow ... For my taste, that goes more towards the original, dark and daring foreign cinema (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, a lot of Japanese / Korean modern cinema) "As It Is In The Sky "It does not sound particularly interesting ... It was not released in the United States, so I sat down to watch a VCD I found in Singapore, preparing to" cross it off the list ". After a boring start, "As is in heaven" becomes that rare movie in which you really get inspired by what is happening on the screen. Weak points: the characters in the film are pure "stock" characters: the Wounded Dreamer, the Bully of the City, the Battered Wife, the Loose Woman who Longs for Love, the Repressed Minister ... Fortunately, they are very much a group nice, besides being well written and well acted. Ingela Olsson, as Minister Inger's wife, would have been nominated for an Oscar if her performance had been in English. Strengths: the music is beautiful and the main song, sung by Gabriella, is really dramatic and memorable. And do not lose sight of the staunch 87-year-old actress who plays Olga, who is aware of the dance steps and the younger ladies! I will not discuss the ending, but I will say it makes sense. There are many emotional things that happen in the last hour of the movie and you are not quite sure why they are happening. Although nothing is explained by words, everything makes sense as the films come to an appropriate crescendo. **** outside *****. Probably the strongest Swedish movie I've seen in my life.
