['I&#39;ve spent the last week watching John Cassavetes movies, starting with &quot;a woman under the influence&quot; and ending on the &quot;premiere night&quot;. I am completely impressed, particularly by these two films. From the first minute to the last on the &quot;opening night&quot;, I was completely absorbed. I&#39;ve only experienced it on a few occasions, but the feeling that this movie was perfect lasted from about two-thirds until the credits appeared. Everything about this film, from the way it was filmed, the incredible interpretation of Gena Rowlands, the credits, the opening, the music, the plot, the sense of depth, the rhythm, the tenderness, the originality, the characters, the ability. Small moments ... for me, it is truly sublime. I could not agree more with the previous comment about taking him to a desert island because the depth of this film is something to contemplate. If you are unfortunate enough to have a fire in your house, I guarantee that, instead of making one last attempt to rescue that amount of money under your bed, you will rescue your copy of this movie.']
