Being from the suburbs of Philadelphia and extremely interested in local history, this film offers an excellent vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes of downtown, a train station that no longer exists, 30th Street Station, that still exists, as well as scenes from the northeast part of the city. Good shots of the old rows as they appeared then. The film becomes a bit "talkative" at times, which causes the viewer to lose interest briefly ... but the general story is solid and very moving. Anyone who has enjoyed this movie should also try to watch the movie "Bright Victory", also with local images of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA, and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The Army Hospital has since become a university campus. None of these movies is available in any format and I can not imagine why. I have them on VHS since the domestic recording, as shown in TCM in recent years. I recommend them to any other history buff in my area!
