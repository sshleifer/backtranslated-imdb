A very silly movie, this starts with a smooth porn sequence, ventures into a comedy similar to that of an art gallery, adds an amazing discovery in the hotel room and then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason. <br /> <br /> What follows is strange and surreal (the particular chronometer scene is exquisitely unnecessary), which culminates in a revealing "turning" ending that is as obvious as unfair to the viewer (see the section on trivia to know why it is deliberately unfair). The film does everything possible to offend as many groups as possible (transsexuals, crazy people and the wonderful "Huggie Bear", racial stereotypes in the subway) and condescendingly treats the viewer as an idiot in the scenes Finals, as the characters are explained endlessly in great detail and again and again what just happened in the movie. Although the female characters in the background at the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is a joy to see: despite its many, many failures, the whole package alone, well, it works
