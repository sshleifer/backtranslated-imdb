Much for their presumed readers of the fair of happiness, Cage and Hopper met and, fortunately, not in a Lynch movie, because RED ROCK WEST is much better than any Lynch movie. Nicolas Cage is a third actor, the porcelain babe is a fatal fatal woman, only Dad Hopper is as bad as ever. RED ROCK WEST is, despite the well-worn cast, one of my favorite American thrillers; in a word, a thriller with some twists. <br /> <br /> It shows mainly the enthusiasm, the amazing rhythm, the emotions, the pleasant suspense, the cute little ass of Lara Flynn Boyle, the enviable physical form of Cage (although undoubtedly ugly, with sharp bird features, thick eyebrows and thin and unusual hair, Cage showed a good general shape?), Hopper's consummate routine, some moderately but truly amusing moments, Cage's game with his intended character, the rigid and psychopathic Hopper's charm, Lara's wickedness, Cage looks like a vagabond, the archetypal wandering of black cinema, hungry, hard if necessary, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle performs as the cold and seductive, Walsh as his heartless husband, and Hopper as the Lynchian hitman he had done before. <br /> <br /> Cage looks pretty dazed or dizzy or very confused and has a severe hangover But this might be her usual appearance.
