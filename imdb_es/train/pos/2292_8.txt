I just saw this Bugs Bunny (the first time it is called here) and the cartoon of Elmer Fudd on the ThadBlog as a link from YouTube. This was the first time that Chuck Jones directed the "wascally wabbit" and, as a result, Bugs has a different voice provided by Mel Blanc than the Brooklyn / Bronx we are more familiar with. In fact, according to Thad, he is channeling Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" personality of that era). Anyway, after Elmer buys his pet, Bugs gets very upset with him when he turns on the radio very loudly, pretending to die after his teacher repeatedly pulls him out of the shower and says "Turn off those lights!" Every time Elmer catches him in his bed. Even with the different voice, Bugs is definitely his naughty person and I laughed at myself all the time! According to Thad, there was an additional scene at the end of Elmer that simply gave the house to Bugs after the hell he suffered, but it was probably considered too sad since he suffered a mental crisis at that time, so it's better than the scene finish He is lost. Anyway, I highly recommend Elmer's pet rabbit.
