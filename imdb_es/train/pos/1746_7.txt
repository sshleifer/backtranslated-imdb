Bela Lugosi plays one of her rare good boy roles in a series based on the long-running radio hit (which was also the source of a movie where Lugosi played the villain). Lugosi cuts an elegant figure and it is sad that he did not get more roles in which he could be the boy in command in a good way. Here, Chandu returns from the east to help the princess Nadji, who is being persecuted by the cult leaders of Ubasti, who need her to bring back the death of the high priestess of her cult. This is a series of good-looking globetrotters that is very fun. To be sure that the pace is a little loose, more like one of the Principals (the production studios), an adventure full of havoc is presented, but it's still nice. This is better than the two feature films that were eliminated because it allows things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having the feeling that "hey, I've missed something". One of the trilogy of three good series that made Lugosi, the others that are SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps.
