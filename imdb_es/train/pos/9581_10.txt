This film documents the circuit of the Harlem ball of the mid-eighties. Much more fun than Palazzo Volpi, although he is sick, this film is a true jewel of misery. One can not help sympathizing with the characters because of their rarity. The sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of garbage and shine. Here the coolest garbage is extremely well documented and properly glamorized. The inclination of the characters to the idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more the adoration of the characters themselves by the spectator, creating a "phenomenon of a phenomenon" effect that makes this film a work of art.
