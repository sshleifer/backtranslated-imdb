I must say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most shocking films I've seen. I've seen it several times and I still feel like I did it the first time; that this film, by itself, could constitute the complete curriculum of a postgraduate course in cinematographic direction. <br /> <br /> A long time ago, movie trailers used to promise: "It will make you laugh, it will make you cry". That is a very trite and abbreviated method to describe what the Grand Canyon does. It takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is programmed to come and go between people close to happiness and the same people close to horror. It's always a short step, too. Just to handle that swing gracefully and without making it look fake or exaggerated is the director's genius. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (of some kind) is coming. After accustoming the audience to move back and forth across the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and returns, but rises from an ordinary marital dispute, through an accidental self-inflicted knife. A wound that may or may not require stitches, in an earthquake that causes the characters to run from the house. At the moment of her relief, forgotten discussion, forgotten toe, the earthquake survived, a neighbor screams that her elderly husband has collapsed. The couple rushes to his aid. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw him. I'm crying. It is not sadness that makes me do this. It is not a particularly sad sequence. What tears me apart is that these few minutes of film were PERFECT. That's perfect! Amazing. (end of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> There is a lot to say about the Grand Canyon. It portrays relatively ordinary people who experience epiphanies and allows the viewer to experience them indirectly. They are not flashy or exaggerated and there is not a long pause to examine the moment carefully. The film advances to the rhythm of life. Even when the characters try to make sense of what has happened, they are not sure what to draw from their experience. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is a very human movie.
