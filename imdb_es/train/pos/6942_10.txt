In the fifties, the age restrictions for films in Brazil were the following: without restriction, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. In general, westerns were allowed for ten years of age, when they had a little more violence, they went to 14, but it was rare to see a restricted western for children under 18 years of age. Winchester 73 was one of them, and I think this explains very well how this movie was considered different from the average. The hero, James Stewart was fighting his own brother who had killed his father. He was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the average person. Anthony Mann tested variations on this type of character in the following films he made with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the protagonist, was far from being virtuous, followed the man who was left with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains who will always be remembered. The story of the film, which always follows the man who keeps the rifle, is one of the most suitable for a western. It was going to become a Fritz Lang film, which did not arrive. When they offered it to Mann, he started again from scratch and did not take anything prepared for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different conception of western, but keeping all its traditions. Winchester is still a great movie to watch over and over again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression it caused on those who saw it when it was originally released.
