A warm and moving film that has a fantasy quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is, as always, magnificent. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has given many great performances, but there is something about this will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> More than anything, you have to see this amazing 5 years. old man, Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated by his presence that I had to buy the film to see it again and again. She is a miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging from the high IMDB rating, I am not the only one hypnotized by this young actress.
