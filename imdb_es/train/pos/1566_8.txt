The series of novels by Leslie Charteris on the adventures of the somber Simon Templar ("The Holy One") was presented on the screen in the late 1930s with the promising George Sanders as Templar. It was a careful choice: Sanders used to play villains with occasional "good papers" (Ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY, Robert Montgomery's "best friend" in RAGE IN HEAVEN). Here, his willingness to bend the rules and break a law fits briefly with his "heavy person," while his good looks and mild demeanor made Templar a shadowy hero like Chester Morris's "Boston Blackie," and ( to a certain extent) that of Peter Lorre "Mr. Moto". <br /> <br /> Movies are not the best series of movie mystery series, but they are useful. Like Rathbone's Holmes series or Oland's Chan series, the show often had actors who repeated roles or performed new ones (the anti-heroine in the movie here was played by Wendy Barrie, who would appear in a second film of the Serie). This, and the slightly familiar movie sets, make the series a comfortable experience for the spectators, who listen to the buzz of the dialogue (always showing the intelligence of Sanders to stay one step ahead of the bad guys), without noticing the flaws obvious of the plot. All these mysteries have flaws due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can not avoid repeating old ideas over and over again. <br /> <br /> Here, the moment that happened was when one of the actors in the cast admitted his affection for Barrie, of whom she was aware for a long time. Soon after, he tries to protect her from the police. But as the film was about the identity of a criminal intellectual author, it became evident that this person was so unworthy that he deserved to be the mysterious intellectual author (that is, the script disguised him as a suspect). <br /> <Brie Barrie seeks proof that her father (who died in prison) was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang. She has several people who attend her, cups like William Gargan, and she receives advice from the brain on how to plan shameful robberies that can not be trapped in her. The day who condemned his father (Jerome Cowan) is determined to have Barrie and his gang. The only detective who seems to have the opportunity to solve the case is Jonathan Hale, who is following Sanders but working reluctantly with him. <br /> <br /> The cast has some good moments in the script: Hale (currently on a special diet) is tempted to eat a delicious lobster dinner made for Sanders by Willie Best. As a result, he has a severe stomach upset, which allows Sanders and Barrie to flee Sanders' apartment. Best has to remind him (when he feels better) to go to a place Sanders told him to go at a certain time. <br /> <br /> There is also an interesting role for Gilbert Emery. In general, playing decent people (like CETWEEN TWODS 'husband), he plays a socially prominent weakling here, whose disappearance resembles that of a character in a Bogart movie. <br /> <br /> In general Film well done for the second half of the billing of a movie theater in 1939. It will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory.
