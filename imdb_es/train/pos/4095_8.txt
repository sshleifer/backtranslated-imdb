Now, my friends, movies like "La BÃªte" (also known as "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be done in the old continent :), in this film we see everyone: horses dirty sex, nympho of the type Gorilla, no dialogue of meaning, etc, etc, etc ... In the serious terms now, it is an allegory, that men can sometimes be bestial, visceral and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It is an amazing cinematic experience, strange and full of grotesque scenes. For all the fans of the amazing European exploitation, I recommend this movie. If you like this one, I recommend: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Alterated States".
