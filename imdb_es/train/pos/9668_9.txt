This is a small movie, with few characters, theatrical. And yet, it says something about Ireland that you will not find anywhere else. This movie IS IRELAND. Everything is dirty, it is sadness, it is self-deception. The boys, the master Doyle, the SP O'Donell, the cannon, the daughter of Senator Doogan, Gar and especially Madge. I know them. I'm in the pub with them or Kneeling to pray with them. They are our sad story and they are our present.
