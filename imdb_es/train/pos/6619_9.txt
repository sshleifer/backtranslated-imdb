['Blade Runner (Deckard is a Replicant!), <br /><br /> City of lost children (increased senses or whatever is used and abused and above all, well, they only give us much less than we could dream of), and <br /><br /> Dark City: <br /><br /> These really should be added. <br /><br /> For a while, I&#39;ve been waiting for an animated movie that could affect me as much as Miyazaki&#39;s stuff. This is the 1st. <br /><br /> Hmm, scratch the &quot;animated&quot; part of that. <br /><br /> I have an intense love-hate relationship with the film noir and, hey, if you do not go, it must be above all love, right? But, there are so many science fiction themes and noir totally immersed in this movie that it is wonderful to see. <br /><br /> These people did an incredible job!']
