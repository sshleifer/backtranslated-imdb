I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and I immediately fell in love. Twenty seven years later, it is still an original inspiration to achieve my goals that I have set out to achieve since then! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of a hard core "behind the scenes" of the entertainment industry during the late 50s, "Sparkle" successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters seeking their place in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too quickly and role models are not available to help. <br /> <br /> The phenomenal music written and composed By Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries the plot with each song. From being subjected to situations that leave almost no choice to make solid decisions in the long term, to make the maximum sacrifice to get ahead, the three girls, Sparkle, Sister and Delores, represent the different routes that one could take. when he set out to reach his ideal opportunity as his contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This movie could have generated the ideas of creating "Dreamgirls" on Broadway, and "Glitter" by Mariah Carey, 25 years later. As a member of the original audience of both productions, I have seen many similarities in both stories with "Sparkle," as well as "Saturday Night Fever," "Fame," "Flashdance," and the off-Broadway hit. "Mom, I want to sing. "
