This is a good movie, but it is not recommended if you do not like smart movies. It's about two guys who want the world to go, and that's exactly what they get. The acting is excellent, the ending was not predictable and actually had a good story, unlike most movies these days. People complain that the movie is too simple or boring. I think they should be limited to movies like The Toxic Avenger (actually I like B movies) or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. One note: if you realize this, you have exactly the same Cube actors, except four actors. Make two notes: wait after the credits (Trust me in this case). Enjoy the movie.
