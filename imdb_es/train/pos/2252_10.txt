Henry Hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for his love of the people of the early days of the history of the United States. However, criticizing the historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people is neither necessary nor useful to comment on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway gave an excellent address that conveys what was a Mormon people in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the period that begins with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith until the release date of the movie. In the delivery of often subtle dialogues and filming, he covered the Mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early fifties. That was just over 10 years after the release of the films and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed, which I observed while building and instilling a curious curiosity about who the Mormons were. I recently bought this movie and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in his film. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. Charity for the needy or not, 3. The family is very important, 4. Listen with respect and care, because even the Opposite messages have important points to consider and adopt, 5. Work hard, both individually and in community, 6. Prepare and store for future days of need, 7. Hope is a binding link for a higher being, and for our daily lives , 8. And, that there is a unique quality for each Group, and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial.
