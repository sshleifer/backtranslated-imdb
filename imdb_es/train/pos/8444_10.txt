After a rocky road of approximately 7 years on NBC, it was decided to make only one last Super Pago. The series had been in the bubble several times because it did not have the numbers that would qualify it as a block destroyer of an hour of television. He had always had a considerable and hard core of hard-core bodies. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if the series with the full title of "HOMICIDE: LIFE IN THE STREET" (1993-99) was a kind of "Mr. In-Between" series. It was too big to just cancel it, but too small to end a case of 'Rabid Ratings Ravings'. <br /> <br /> During the precarious tenure of Friday afternoons, they presented some of the best and most audaciously artistic of the dramas per hour. There I said Artistic, Artistic! But, please, remember that we refer to artistic preaching, but not only false, pretentious, pedantic, politically correct. <br /> <br /> When finally, it was somewhat sure that it was the end of the line for "HOMICIDE"; This super episode was prepared like this 2 hours made for TV Movie. <br /> <br /> By looking at all the events of the past seasons and the parade of regular characters, the production team came out and gave us what turned out to be a super send. <br /> <br /> OUR HISTORY? ????? As we join the story, we find that the commanding officer of the Baltimore Homicide Unit, Lieutenant Al Giardello, has "retired the passer", that is, retired from work. But 'G' is still not ready to actually retire. Then, instead of a rocking chair or a fishing rod, we discover that Al is running for mayor of 'Charm City'. <br /> <br /> While I was in town, making some campaign stops and speeches, the former detective lieutenant takes a killer bullet. I live, but in a coma, he is taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news is quickly disseminated and, as if officially convened, we find all the Baltimore Unit Detectives we have seen in the program who present themselves to offer their services and assistance. There is a great meeting of all these old and present gomeros, who collaborate and follow each track and possibility of a track. <br /> <br /> The Producer found a way to deal with those who had previously died by bringing their memory into the story. They managed to answer some long-standing questions and even introduced some here to the undisclosed ones. The whole story ends the series in the most satisfying and original way. But at least for now, we'll leave it as "classified." <br /> <br /> By wrapping everything in a small, neat package, this TV movie surely receives our support. As for the rating "THE FILM OF HOMICIDE", we must give it an A or A +, even. But, regardless of the grade here, it did not score as high as a typical weekly episode.
