['It has been 16 years since its original release, I would have expected that some &quot;marketing assistant&quot; would have promoted a live actor version of this classic, or at least I would have tried to relaunch the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why the science fiction or cartoon network has not adapted to this. The Galaxy Rangers actually had well thought out diagrams, and even better scripts. The animation was superior to the average quality at the time, and excellent compared to the slide show of today&#39;s Japanese animation. It predates the heavy toy tie on the market, this may also have sealed his fate. I would be willing to spend cash on a GR DVD if it was available.']
