Tom had a desire to make movies for a long time and he did. It is as if I had visualized a dirty and worn notebook full of small ideas that it has been filling and loading for 10 years. There are no concessions of character transformations, there are no Hollywood ingredients, only life and a little magic. The balance, the speed, the rarity in the comedy against the drama is perfectly balanced. This movie takes you on a journey that ends before you realize how nice it was. The music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied. the fact that this film is nothing, just a sequence of sketches of people that are linked mainly through a group of one of the characters, makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining, it is brilliant because it is empty. between the lines is happening. See or not see, is that the?
