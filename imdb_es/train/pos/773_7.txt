I expected something different: more passion, drama ... Again, another failed attempt at originality. I regret to say that the film falls into the old clich√© of 'cheeses'. 15-year-olds can appreciate it. The performance was Not very convincing and the common lines, without any ingenuity. Still, the soundtrack was good and well adapted. I can not say that this film is a total failure, because people see it but it does not meet the expectations of the public and Immerse yourself in mediocrity. So, to conclude, the production keeps you in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half, which is something appreciable. Therefore, I think it's worth seeing if you do not get upset.
