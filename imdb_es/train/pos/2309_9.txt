It was a life change, it REALLY WAS! The man on the moon is an awesome experience to see. The performance was fabulous, the storyline was excellent, and this was a perfect start to Reese Witherspoon's career. look how someone could not love this movie. Sure, it's not the best movie of all, although it was close to her, but it was very fun to watch, and I even laughed a lot with one of the jokes, and a lot of other small laughs. Of course, there were also some moments when you cried, but this movie was enlightening and illuminates your day, although you have to get a little depressed about the story from time to time. I can not believe that this film has not won at least one prize, and I can not believe that it was seen by so few people on this site. Watch this movie if you have not done it, because it is definitely moving.
