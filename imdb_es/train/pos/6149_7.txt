I just bought the restored version of a movie that I remember fondly since childhood and it is undoubtedly made for a curious evening of entertainment. Bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form, the deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) link events in a fairly ordered way. What is a bit disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered. Clearly, the soundtrack of this recording had been lost or damaged, so some brilliant spark in Disney decided to copy the scenes with a new dialogue. Which would have been great, except that half of the cast was not there to do it (some for better reasons than others) and everything has a pretty bad quality. Part of lip syncing is pretty bad, and David Tomlinson's voice has been dubbed by a guy who does not look like David Tomlinson at all (I think there's a hint of German). However, it is good to listen to the full versions of all the songs (although "Step in the right Direction" is still absent) and the magic moments in this movie still shine. And I challenge you not to laugh when young Paul looks so innocently at Angela Lansbury and lullabies "but what does that have to do with my knob?"
