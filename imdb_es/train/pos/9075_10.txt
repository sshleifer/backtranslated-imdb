I missed almost the entire first season, but when the other shows went to reruns, I started watching. I ended up buying all the first season of iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor makes me roll all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes a little Russell does a lot. I enjoy more of the other members of the cast (but I do not say that it is not added to the show). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. If you have not checked, try it. If you can see the episode in which "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you'll see how good this program is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series has a long history.
