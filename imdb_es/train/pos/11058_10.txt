I should say that this is the first quality romantic comedy I've seen. I had depth and, although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together, there was still longing and anticipation. the idea that maybe they do not meet ... it's an independent film, after all. This film was well written, directed and acted. The dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent.
