['Damn, that was a lot to assimilate. I was pretty hypnotized in everything. It was quite perfect, although I would say that the edition had a lot to do with that. I can not believe that this guy has stayed on good terms with most of them (especially with Anton) to get all these images without any ... serious. The Dandy went well together, the middle class children took advantage of their situation (and with good reason!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, which maybe was not what many other people felt. Great piece of shooting and great choice of subject (s). I recommend it to any music / movie fan. You will probably learn something about cinema.']
