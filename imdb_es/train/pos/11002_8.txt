Cypher, directed by Vincenzo Natali, is a complex and imaginative thriller that, although it requires a certain suspension of beliefs and a lot of concentration, manages to be a totally entertaining experience. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), a fanatic. -the husband at home with a dominant wife, decides to add a little flavor to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at the high-tech company Digi Corp. His job is to travel to conferences throughout the country (under the identity assumed by Jack Thursby) and secretly broadcast the speeches given to their bosses, through an ingenious and small electronic contraption. <br /> <br /> Actually, speeches are nothing more than a cover for much more infamous activities. Morgan, along with his fellow conference attendees, is being brainwashed. The drugged water they drink puts them in a temporary coma, during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities. Once they are fully convinced that they are someone else, they are told to apply for jobs at rival companies, where they can participate in corporate espionage without suspicion. <br /> <br /> But Digi Corp's plans are frustrated by the intervention of the shadow operative Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who opens Morgan's eyes to what is really happening. She gives Morgan an antidote to mind-altering drugs so that he can resist brainwashing techniques. She also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects that he does not fully believe that he is Jack Thursby, then he will be "eliminated." Morgan follows the game and applies for a job in the rival Sunways business. <br /> <br /> However, upon arriving at your new place of work, you are given a polygraph test and you are immediately answered as a spy. Fortunately, Sunways bosses see this as an ideal opportunity to send fake data to Digi Corp and Morgan becomes a double agent. <br /> <br /> From here, things become increasingly complicated; The plot turns and turns and poor Morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone. In an exciting ending, everything becomes clear (but only if you have been following events very carefully). <br /> <br /> Director Natali handles procedures with confidence and certainly has a great ability to produce an elegant looking movie for a relatively low budget. He manages to get some great performances from his talented cast; Jeremy Northam, in particular, is fantastic: his interpretation of Morgan, initially somewhat nervous, reproduces perfectly. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another fascinating film by a director who is willing to take a risk and I look forward to his upcoming projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
