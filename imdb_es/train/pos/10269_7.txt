['In the spirit of the classic &quot;The Sting&quot;, this film comes where it really hurts ... in the heart! A primordial and appropriate female psychiatrist, hungry for adventure, meets the dirtiest and most rotten of the scoundrels. The vulnerable doctor falls in love with the bad guy and begs to be involved in his operation. While the movie moves like &quot;slow&quot;, its climax and its ending are impressive! You will especially enjoy how the doctor &quot;forgives&quot;!']
