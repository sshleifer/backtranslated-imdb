['First of all, speaking as a fan of the genre, &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; is an amazing, virtuous and superb action movie. <br /><br /> Secondly, it&#39;s nonsense of cartoonish superhero things. <br /><br /> Third, the film has a complex, important point about crime fighters becoming criminals. No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or to the scandalous domestic aggressions of the executive power to constitutional rights, none is necessary. <br /><br /> Therefore, the latest in the series &quot;Bourne&quot;, in the hands of Paul Greengrass (from the &quot;Supremacy of Bourne&quot; of 2004 and &quot;United 93&quot; last year), is a significant achievement, perhaps slowed down but not diminished by the inevitable excesses. of the genre. <br /><br /> &quot;Impressive&quot; above is understood as a complementary adjective and a description of physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame, the viewer apparently holds his breath, pushed against the chair by the force of the relentless globetrotter. , absolutely suspenseful action. There is no interruption, there is no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film, and yet it never becomes monotonous and tedious as some family music videos do in just a few minutes. <br /><br /> Oliver Wood&#39;s direct cinematography is the best of Tony Gilroy&#39;s script of Robert Ludlum&#39;s 1990 novel (which does not compare to the &quot;Bourne identity&quot; written a decade earlier). <br /><br /> Matt Damon is, once again, the inevitable and irreplaceable Bourne, the deadliest CIA agent of fantasy, this time facing the entire agency in search of his identity, his past and the mysterious program of the agency that has turned him in a murderous machine. Nothing like his quietly heroic Edward R. Murrow, the always wonderful David Strathairn is the unpleasant official of the main agency, who launched against Bourne to try to hide some illegal policies and brutal procedures that &quot;do not take prisoners&quot;. <br /><br /> Joan Allen plays what seems to be the good cop against Strathairn&#39;s bad guy. And, there&#39;s Julia Stiles as agent, once again coming to Bourne&#39;s aid; a combination of the Greengrass direction and Stiles&#39; performance results in a surprising impact on the part of a mostly silent character, his lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue. <br /><br /> So good is &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; that it escapes with the old bit of a single man against the world, this time with ridiculous excesses, since Bourne defies the restrictions of geography, time, gravity ... and physical in general. . (Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building? Why not, it looks great). <br /><br /> All this magic of the &quot;real world&quot;: jumping from one country to another in seconds, to reach an unknown place exactly how, when and how it is needed, overcomes the improbabilities of special effects and superhero cartoons. And yet, only a clueless pedant would allow &quot;facts&quot; to interfere with the ecstasy based on the entertainment of Bourne&#39;s fantasy.']
