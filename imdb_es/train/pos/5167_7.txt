I have to say that the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was really confused about who was who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and wore a jacket. Then, when all the men arrived at the camp, it turned out that there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but he was not. I said where is Bill Paxson? Then, there was a boy with his girlfriend. He said he was 21 years old. This was supposed to be a 20-year meeting of the most memorable of the field director (Alan Arkin). Later, this same girl was interacting and talking about her experiences in the camp. That makes no sense. She would have been one year old. That said, the movie turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was the nice guy who was always being bothered. A man was a complete narcissist, and he ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-style field director, who admits that he has lost contact with modern youth. The best part was that none of the adult campers was successful in life. None of them had great careers. This seemed a very real life. The movie was compared to The Big Chill. In a way, it was not as exciting as the Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, although the beginning is not promising, the film ended up becoming a very good one.
