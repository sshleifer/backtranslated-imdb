I just watched this movie tonight, opening night. It was great!! I am a big fan of sports movies, and this was one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin, where she lives ... and she was supposed to buy you a drink once ... well ... she kind of put you standing up ... but she did not want to do it !: C) [is not that anyone is going to believe that ...]) Anyway, it's a great movie. Everyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see it. :DO)
