The photograph of this budget-supply production is surprisingly bad. The colors are muddy and brown and the photograph looks very eighties. The direction and editing are often lacking in inspiration and are also like television movies. * And * at first, the movie just seems to want to torture its viewers with spooky images of sex and violence. Hans Zimmer's score is also a typically simple and soft work by this overrated and untalented composer. <br /> <br /> But if you're willing to continue watching the movie, you're rewarded with a very moving family history, a kind of European. Version of the family of Edna Ferber epos Gigante. Although at first you wonder why Clara married this idiotic man, even his character has more depth and more background by which one can judge him. Clara delivers the spiritual lesson of the film, a grandiose and moving statement in the face of the terrible events in her country. Her daughter, whose lover is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of her international career, understands that lesson and, ultimately, tries to live up to her. The way in which the plot was constructed with the end reflecting the beginning was great. All the actors also do a great job. I was wondering "Who is the actress who plays Blanca?" All the time, but of course, it was a very young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> In general, this movie really made me want to read the book.
