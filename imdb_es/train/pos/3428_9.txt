I saw this movie tonight in New York at the Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what to expect, I did not read much about it because I knew I would see it no matter what. In short, it is very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of "anti-war" statements, which for me, left politics out of this. The soldiers spoke mainly of their awareness of toxicity in their training at the training camp, and how difficult it was once they returned to civilian life. It was really good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mej√≠a talk about the difficulty of surviving not only in the war, but also in refusing to let the command return when it was against personal morals. Make no mistake, this is not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says it has not seen it or does not live with the scars of war on their souls.
