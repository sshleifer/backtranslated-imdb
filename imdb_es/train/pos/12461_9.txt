An intelligent script by the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and the intelligent interpretations of the two male protagonists: ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or if it is the other way around) result in an attractive and entertaining thriller. <br /> <br /> Add to the competent leadership of veteran JEAN HERMAN and a scant but effective score by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it's easy to see why this film has an odd timeless quality. <br /> <br /> This is a story of friends or friends with two. Loners, both disillusioned and tired of the world, returning, presumably from Algiers. Like the other colonial powers of this time (after the Second World War until the 1960s), France had struggled to maintain appearances abroad. The loss of Algiers was a bitter blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (the original title) narrates the actions of our two (anti) heroes as they struggle to try, after their download. <Br /> <br /> It happens one thing after another, and the viewer really has to pay attention, because JAPRISOT is lean and economical with his script: if it is there, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that these two men struggle physically and psychologically for a long weekend. Their motivation is very different, their goals are different: their survival depends entirely on others. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different from the outside: the first, possibly a pretty boy, and the second an ugly, ugly one, adds to chemistry. <br /> <br /> That search creates a great story, which, in turn, makes it a great movie. <br /> <br /> So that he does not forget that there are women in this film, and faithful to the Japrisot method, they are also memorable, although not so complete; To say much more would be to spoil the pleasure of discovering your true nature. <br /> <br /> TOWNHOUSE, THE FRIEND HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM; AN ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 IMPROVED; ONLY IN English (not even subtitles for people with hearing problems); A RUNNING TIME OF 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but the music of DE ROUBAIX has a lot of power! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
