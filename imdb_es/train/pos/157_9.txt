['&quot;Gespenster&quot; (2005) forms, along with &quot;Yella&quot; (2007), and &quot;Jerichow&quot; (2008), the Gespenster trilogy by director Christian Petzold, undoubtedly one of the German film directors of creme-De-la-creme hour. <br /><br /> Broadly speaking, &quot;Gespenster&quot; tells the story of a French woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3-year-old girl while the mother circled her head for 1 minute in Berlin, and had never seen her before. Since then, the mother continues to travel to Berlin whenever there is a possibility and seeks, with the help of photographs dilated in time, for girls about the age of their current age. As we heard later in the film, the mother was already many times convinced that she had found her daughter Marie. However, this time, when he meets Nina, everything is very different. <br /><br /> The film does not bring solutions, not even partial solutions, and to the extent that it is quite disappointing. We are not equipping ourselves to decide whether the mother is really crazy or not, if her real daughter is still alive or not. The most disappointing is the end. After what we have witnessed in the film, it is an imposition for the observer to stay alone when the author leaves Nina alone. The simple act of moving away, symbolizing that nothing has changed, can be a strong effect of dramaturgy (for example, in &quot;Umberto D.&quot;), but in &quot;Gespenster&quot;, it is displaced. <br /><br /> As critics have been suggesting Freudian motives in this movie, let me try: why is it that similar people do not know each other, especially not the people that another similar person knows? This is a rather foolish question, of agreement, from the point of view of the Aristotelian logic, according to which the notion of the individual is sustained. The individual is a person who does not share any of their defining characteristics with anyone else. So, the Aristotelian answer to my question is: they do not know each other because their similarity is pure change. Everyone who is not crazy, believes that. However, what about the case if these similar people share other similarities that can hardly be due to change, for example, scarves on their left ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark below the right shoulder blade? This is the metaphysical context from which this film is made, although I am not sure that even the director has not realized that. Despite our modern and Aristotelian world, superstition, preserved in the mythologies of people around the world, says that similar people also share parts of their individuality, and that individuality, therefore, is not something erratic, but more Well diffusional, so that the boundaries between people are open, such and other similar beliefs build a strong spine of irrationalism despite our otherwise very rational thinking, a source of Gespenster of the most interesting kind.']
