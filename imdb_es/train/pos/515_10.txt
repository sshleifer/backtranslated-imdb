I remember the first time I saw this movie: I was in the office working during the weekend and the television was on because of the background noise. But gradually I found myself more and more committed to this film that I had never seen or heard of, until I was completely absorbed. A Matter of Life & Death (the British title, Stairway to Heaven in the US) is charming, compelling, capricious and moving, all in a superbly written, well-acted and perfectly directed package. It's a classic that really lives up to Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane and Chariots of Fire. WHY have you never received the same public notice and prominence of the video store? Fortunately, SOME expert critics have put it on their lists of "The 100 best of all time." There is hope: the 1940 Fantasy was not a hit until the 1960s, and the Wizard of Oz was a flop at the box office, but it became a hit on television. Buy it, rent it, look at it, demand it! You will not be disappointed!
