This movie was excellent, a little scary, but excellent at that. For those of you who have heard about the columbine and know the history, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. In the back of your mind, you know that people think about this, but you never realize how bad it is, and this movie makes you realize it. Seriously, it's so good. It also makes you think twice before making fun of someone safe. I read a book about the massacre in Colombia and it made me think, this movie worries me and scares me to death. On the negative side it's like a guide on how to kill someone for serial killers. I recently received a threat, and I could not believe it, but after this movie I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never really know what they are, so take it seriously and do not underestimate anyone.
