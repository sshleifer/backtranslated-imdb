['I recently searched for the newly released FLY AWAY HOME widescreen DVD and found an interesting title I had never heard of before: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough film caught my eye (he was responsible for fine films such as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the script was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This &quot;Special Edition&quot; was full of interesting sound material and the price was just under $ 10.00, so I tried it and bought it. WOOHOO! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan plays Archie Gray Owl, a real-life hunter in the 1930s, who came to love and respect the wilds of Canada and worked to help protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond film) gives a shady, warm and powerful interpretation, like Annie Galipeau, as the young woman who loves and influences her feelings for the creatures of the earth, especially the beaver. The good score of George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and the beautiful photography of Roger Pratt contribute enormously to the effectiveness of the film. And the extras on this DVD are something else! It includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real Gray Owl, as well as audio commentary tracks by Attenborough and producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other additions plus PLUS options for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM functions. GRAY OWL has been released directly to DVD in the United States, a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to the lack of interest of Hollywood in distributing something that is not loaded with much violence and sex. This is a film that not only informs and entertains but also leaves something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the end of the movie, and a new love and understanding for the beavers! GRAY OWL is a very good movie, it&#39;s worth watching! This is one that I hope to share with others.']
