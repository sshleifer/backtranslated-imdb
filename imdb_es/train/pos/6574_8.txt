This could be difficult for some people, getting used to the Hollywood production styles. The direction is not inspired, apparently simply a filming of the setting of the stage, and the quality of the audio is bad here and there (the creaking of people's clothing occasionally competes with their voices, etc.). <br /> <br /> My friends and I began to look without knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost discouraged us. It seemed very stagy and cheesy. Then we realized the tone of the content and really started having fun. <br /> <br /> It's very funny, despite the mercy. Definitely, give it a chance if you appreciate a great dialogue. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is adorable, of course.
