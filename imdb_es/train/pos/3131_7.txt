I really enjoyed this. I understood it thinking that it was going to be a documentary, but he revealed himself as a good piece of joke. <br /> <br /> I think this has been done well, almost like an extended TV show in a movie, but because the characters or the original actors are willing to have fun and have fun, this helps make it work an old way and great style. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the original TV series, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this. <br /> <br /> Q
