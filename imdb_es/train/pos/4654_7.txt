This is an embezzler, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates a British company, Texa-Conn or something, posing as a computer expert and security expert. She secretly learns to hack into the computer, while accumulating the admiration of her boss, Karl Malden, the enmity of her rival in the office, Bob Newhart, and the love of his inept secretary, Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> Some commercial details were a bit murky for these non-business oriented eyes, but they are credible enough and I have a general idea. Ustinov, the peculante Peter, establishes false businesses in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart, and uses the Texa-Conn computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz establishments. The foreign companies, of course, consist of nothing but himself, Ustinov, and the addresses are the attic of an abandoned artist in Paris, a hairdresser in Rome and a bakery in Germany. He simply visits them to collect the checks he has sent himself. <br /> <br /> I did not think I would like it during the first few minutes because it seemed rather slow. I expected something with a faster pace and more indignation, in the line of "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Hill Gang". But this film insinuates itself in your good graces as you appreciate the sober humor in the plot, the characterizations and the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It would probably be a bad idea to give away too many relatively subtle gags, but here are some examples of the most notable ones. <br /> <br /> Ustinov to Secretary Smith: "Let me have the assets of these companies." Smith: "Active? What are they?" Ustinov: "Little female donkeys." Now, nothing is made of this little exchange. There is a quick cut without delay for any laugh, which is appropriate because one's reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinov looks for that Paris loft. It is covered with cobwebs. The bricks are scattered around and a couple of paintings of the former occupant have been left behind. The owner does not speak English and Ustinov does not know French. Ustinov points out a children's painting of a naked woman and chuckles, "Ah, a fam-tal fam, huh?" The owner also laughs, responds: "Vous le prenez pour une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh - ANNIE, so that's his name!" Owner: "Oui?" Ustinov: "Entente cordiale!" (Mes amis, if I made a mistake with those genres, je m'excuse). Bob Newhart, as Willard Gnatpole (!) Has the affections of Maggie Smith and is supposed to drive her home, but tells him he is taking "the scenic route". There is an immediate sequence of suggestive road signs. "Caution." "Lay-By". "Yield." "Performance." Ending with the imperious "STOP / CHILDREN". There is another montage when the board of directors is about to discover Ustinov's plan: blurred ceilings, police cars, a farewell hug from Maggie, which ends with a sign: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe one more. I still can not get over Malden as boss, declaring decisively: "I never torment myself for the decisions", then I swallowed a handful of pills and washed them with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> The acting is indisputably good. It's the best role of Bob Newhart, for example. Not that he had so many, and not that his range was not limited, but it is perfect in this part. The musical score of Laurie Johnson obviously had a lot of effort. She seems to have written a brief concert for flute. Ustinov's passion is music and his establishments abroad are headed by false names such as Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. The false president of Stuttgart is someone called Schmidt, and he is an anomalous clinker. Maggi Smith is pretty, sexy, bourgeois and it turns out not to be as stupid as she seems. <br /> <br /> Lovely, in your quiet way, but do not expect comical fireworks.
