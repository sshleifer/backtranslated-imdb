Hoping to see another Nunsploitation movie with an evil Mother Superior who abuses and tortures her charges, Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than she had anticipated. <br /> <br /> She actually has a feminist story, although I do not think so. This term existed at the time when the film was developed. It certainly was not practiced. Women (and Jews and the poor) are very oppressed and locked in low places in society. Throughout history, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she can no longer sit and do something about it, although with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> The previous credit The sequence has Flavia as a young teenager near a battlefield. She sees a wounded "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few who is still alive) and tries to help him. Before she can, her father full of hate beheads the soldier and shakes his head in his face (great family dynamics, huh?). After this, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses an even greater injustice. Although the scenes involve violence, rapes and nuns, I would consider this more as a historical drama than as Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> In fact, many of the ingredients for a poor-quality piece of exploitation are there, but acting, camera work, plot and music are too good to keep it at that level. Most of the "nun" movies I've seen usually have the basic premise that: a good girl somehow ends up in a convent, where the Mother Superior is a supreme bitch who likes to spank people and / or make their lives hell. <br /> <br /> Flavia spends much of the first part of the film, passively questioning all the atrocities that occur around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes familiar with the strong spirit (but a little crazy, she likes to pee like me, but it is much easier for the boys), sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not shrink from fear like the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as their liberators (from the cruelty and near slavery of the abbey). In fact, it is a Christian, not a Muslim invader, who crosses the beloved sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> It is the death of Agatha that sends Flavia in her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her ... Her father treats her like a garbage. His Muslim lover abandons her at a very inopportune moment. I do not want to reveal too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened by the conclusion. This is a great movie, so do not be discouraged by its reputation (not deserved) as a trash epic. Also, how the hell could a movie go wrong with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli? I'm not familiar with the other works of Maria Casares, but Sister Agatha is an incredible character. <br /> <br /> I have read many excellent reviews of the launch of Synapse (USA), but I love my German X. Classified copy of DVD Kult. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but it actually has a bit more image information on all edges than the Synapse release. <br /> <br /> And there are also many excellent, wise or funny lines of dialogue (many of sister Agatha). <br /> <br /> "Why is God man? The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit? All are men! " -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are afraid, look at them, sister, they're afraid they'll take away their power!" -Mr. Agatha (with regard to Christians fleeing after the Muslims arrive) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going? Muslims can not do anything to you that Christians have not done! Ha Ha Ha ! " -Mr. Agatha (to a group of Christian women who flee) <br /> <br /> "Lord, bless these Muslims, for putting fear in these pompous Christians". -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Do you need the mere sight of a Muslim to make you $ h! T your underwear?" -Mr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing message: "Flavia Gaetani, who is not yet a Muslim, is no longer a Christian, was punished as a fugitive nun." The idea of ​​the film came from the events that took place during the invasions Muslims of Italy that culminated in what is still remembered as THE MARTYRD OF 800 IN OTHER WORDS "
