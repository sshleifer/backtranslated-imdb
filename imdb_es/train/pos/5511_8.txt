['Part II or formerly known as GUERILLA, is also a great achievement, but it is not as entertaining as PART I because this is where we begin to witness what could have caused the fall and death of Che Guevara. Once again, I am impressed by the cause and effect that both parties have in their interconnected stories. We are reminded again and again that the main character, Che Guevara is an Argentine. Some of the men in Fidel&#39;s army chose not to receive orders from a foreigner and now that Che has chosen to leave the consolation of victory to continue the revolutionary in Bolivia, he also does not receive much respect from his new army and the natives. , Just because he&#39;s a foreigner. <br /><br /> Regarding technical aspects, I think Part II would have been more useful if before everything else, right after the map was displayed, it would show some highlights of the previous release just to update the memory of its characters and what he himself has established. in doing so, so that the audience understands why their methods were successful in Cuba but do not work in Bolivia. Now it is clear in this segment, that Che is not as charismatic as Fidel Castro. In Bolivia, he is dealing with a group of soldiers whose hearts are not completely in it. It is said that the ingredient for the revolutionary is love ... well, they do not care much about their country, so it&#39;s a difficult sale. It is terribly painful and difficult for Che to get others to adhere to his vision. <br /><br /> I like a particular scene that illustrates Che&#39;s condition of deterioration, a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly Che tried to direct it, and then his genius seized him and, for a moment, he forgets who is a doctor , and becomes this desperate soldier who stabs his own horse. Your army is like a horse that does not want to be driven. But at the same time, the film crawls, is based on small cameos of familiar faces that will recognize only for a brief entertainment and, for the most part, is hit from left to right by one obstacle after another, but maybe that&#39;s the intention of Part II, if so ... then it definitely works. Applauding the cinematography that gives us a first-person view at the moment of Che&#39;s last breath. It is possible that this film does not answer the questions of why Che Guevara was so stubborn, why he was so determined to achieve it even when the odds were against him and why he deeply wants South America to have the same destiny as Cuba, but the CHE movie It&#39;s a story worth telling.']
