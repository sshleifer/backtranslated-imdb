I've seen this movie in the theater when it came out a few years ago and I really liked it. But I still wanted to see it again this year to see if it's still good compared to the movies that are released now, and I'd like to say that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you should not miss any minute of this movie. If the action is not followed completely, it will be lost and the end will not be understood. <br /> <br /> The ending is what makes this movie so good that you can not wait for it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the producer!
