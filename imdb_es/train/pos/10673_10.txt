Hello to all the people that have seen this wonderful movie, I am sure they would have liked it as much as I did. I love the songs once you've seen the show, you can sing as if you were part of the show singing and dancing. dancing and singing. The song ONE is a favorite musical song of all time, and the trumpets at the end with the mirror are so oh, you have to look at this one.
