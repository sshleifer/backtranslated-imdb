['&quot;GI Samurai&quot; sees Sonny Chiba and some other guys being transported back into civil war in feudal Japan for no particular reason, and a lot of carnage is produced. It&#39;s a pretty exaggerated trial of sword versus machine gun that ultimately produces some interesting results. <br /><br /> The plot essentially extends along the rails that could be expected from the title; the initial pranks of &quot;out of the water&quot; (&quot;what is this flying metal box?&quot;, etc., etc.), &quot;we are not better here&quot;, the discussions and, ultimately, a great battle. The latter is proof that the film is not taken seriously in itself, the carnage that occupies most of the second half when the samurai army fights against Chiba&#39;s platoon; a confrontation that one would fully expect from the title, but still manages to be overwhelmed with his inventiveness and extravagance. It is undoubtedly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and does not creep despite its extension. <br /><br /> Chiba has an abrupt performance as Iba, initially a good leader, but someone who is finally questioning his own moral, since the situation has an effect on him. This is undoubtedly one of its best vehicles of its excellent CV. In the final act, the two worlds have had such an effect for each other, you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers, since they seem to be asking &quot;were not we better then?&quot; But this is, perhaps, reading a little more than what is described can be described as two very entertaining hours of (almost) uninterrupted action.']
