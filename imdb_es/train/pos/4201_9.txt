Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by the nonconformist of the film Samuel Fuller, contains a surprising opening that establishes a double complication. Metro driver Candy (Susan Peters) collides with pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark dipped in cool Sinatra tones). She is not aware that she is carrying a valuable microfilm; McCoy does not realize that he is cursing him. Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents. Thus, the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledge. Candy is doubly monitored (Skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the overconfident little thief, is singularly unconscious, followed by federal agents; The federals, knowing everything, are, ultimately, helpless. They can not stop the "passing" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
