I already loved "How the the Grinch Stole Christmas" when it was released and I still love it, 5 years later. Still many people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never received much love at the time it was published. <br /> <br /> Sure, the movie is exaggerated and corny, but that's the reason why this movie is so lovely and fun to watch. All sets, costumes and characters are done perfectly in a fun way, without actually being ridiculous. It is a visually spectacular movie to watch. It is a film of the countryside at its best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this fun little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why the movie works and why it's so fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He really takes the film with his good and funny role. Of course, he is helped by the compelling makeup, which also received an Academy Award. Of course, if you are an enemy of Jim Carrey, you should not even think about watching this movie. This movie is really your movie and it makes everything work and it is very fun to watch it. Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans perform other fun and memorable roles as the young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good moral, but for me it is a bit silly. Maybe it's because I'm Dutch and we do not really celebrate Christmas so enthusiastic and big here, like in the United States or England. For me, the film was simply fun and entertaining, and the moral left me quite cold to be honest. <br /> <br /> James Horner's musical score is good and fun, even though it's Horner's daily average. It still works perfectly for the movie and helps make part of the scene work. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
