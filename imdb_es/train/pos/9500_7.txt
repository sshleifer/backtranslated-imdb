I saw this movie on television and I was fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a good movie and you can see it for the beauty of Africa and, of course, of Mccomb. At that moment I was thrilled to see this movie and, from then on, I am trying to get the VCD of this movie, but I can not find it. Huge African lions make their appearance in his film and we will be limited by the size of those animals and the grace of them. The entire section of the public can see this movie, especially children will enjoy this movie. But some scenes involving Mccomb force parents to orient themselves for this film. It is a pleasant holiday movie for everyone.
