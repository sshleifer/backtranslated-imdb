I was 10 years old when this program was on television. By far, it was my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was simply beautiful ... I just ordered the DVD (15 episodes). They did not have superpowers. They simply had superior human abilities (strength, hearing, sight). The 3 actors were very good in their roles, very credible. There was a good story in each episode. At that time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was supposed to be good, and the performances of the characters were excellent. There were no luxury things, like in other shows. They did not try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I recommend this TV show to anyone who likes good things.
