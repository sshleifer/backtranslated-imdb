I'm not tired of saying that this is one of the best political thrillers that have been made. The story takes place in a fictional state, but obviously it is the Kennedy assassination. A sincere and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man Daslow (= Oswald) and, although all the other officials want to close the case, he continues to investigate with his team . <br /> <br /> The script is written tight and fast and keeps the tension until the end. Only the part related to the Milgram experiment on authorities is (although not uninteresting) a little out of place. The final sequence, which explains who Icarus really is, partially filmed in slow motion and intensified by a soundtrack by Morricone, is the most powerful sequence I've seen in a movie.
