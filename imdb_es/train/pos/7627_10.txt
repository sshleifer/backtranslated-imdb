I remember seeing this movie a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to Graceland, everything went back to the flood. Why has not this had a video or DVD release yet? It is a sacrilege that this majesty of making movies has never been released, while other trash has been thrown. In fact, this is the John Carpenter movie that has not been released. In fact, I have not seen it on TV since the day I saw it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role for which he was born. The rest of the horror of John Carpenter brought this gem that I would love TV to play again. He is well acted and well executed in terms of singing. Crushing with pleasure most of Elvis' greatest hits. I think this was also the movie that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter, which led them to make several great movies (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, and Escape from LA. of someone doing a remake or his own version of his life, which I think not only would stain the king but also ruin the magic that this has.If this is not released, then we will be in Heartbreak Hotel.
