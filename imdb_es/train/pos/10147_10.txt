['Does anyone know the exact quote about &quot;time and love&quot; from George Ede, also known as Father Fitzpatrick in the movement, had to be you? Was he talking to Charlie and Annna in the church when they left? If I do not have to rent the movie. This was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /><br /> I met my only true love (my soulmate) and although I had the experience of knowing him when I least expected it, I was not prepared for that kind of emotional relationship. <br /><br /> Although we got married, I did not have enough maturity to give as much as I thought. I took pleasure in him and took his love for granted, and he endured it for 7 years. <br /><br /> Finally he left with resentment, but we are still hurt and angry and without believing in the way it turned out. I had some very difficult lessons to learn and now we have been separated for 3 years. <br /><br /> This movie meant a lot because I&#39;m still waiting to reconcile with my one true love. NOW I can appreciate that distinctive feeling inside me and Father Fitzpatrick&#39;s quote seemed true to me. <br /><br /> I know that when he has healed enough to trust me again, we will marry again. <br /><br /> NEVER COME COMPLACENT AND MAKE TRUE LOVE FOR THE GRANTED! It has been the hardest lesson of my life. <br /><br /> Also the music in this movie is outstanding and SIGNIFICANT! This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. It&#39;s worth waiting for TRUE LOVE, if it&#39;s meant to be, whatever happens, it will happen! Nothing is impossible, even when it&#39;s the second time! Thank you!']
