I really liked this movie. The story jumps from one side to another quite and it is not easy to follow. There is no resolution for the story at all, and you have left to wonder what really happened. Since I like that kind of movie I enjoyed this. I especially like the "dating" scenes between the boys and I was dragged into their lives. And, of course, any movie with Naked Staphane Rideau will get a couple of extra points. ;-)
