Riding Giants is an incredible movie. It really shows how these people lived back then only for surfing. Their lives were basically surfing, living, breathing and having fun. They did not care about money, jobs, girls or anything. For them the waves were their girls. I've never been on a surfboard, and it seems so hard, I do not understand how they can stay in them, it does not make any sense. This is an amazing movie and if you like surfing, then you really should watch this movie. If you are a surfer and want to discover who started sailing, how it came true, who is really famous or whatever, then you really should see it. It can be a documentary, but it's really good. -Tara F.-
