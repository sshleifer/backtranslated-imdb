The only thing that bothers me about this movie is that the DVD is very expensive. It's too much for my budget right now, or I'd buy it, because the movie is a good example of black cinema ... and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion produces excellent DVDs, but sometimes the price requested is a bit too high. That's the case here for a 80-minute black-and-white mono sound movie that is good but nothing extraordinary, from a cinematic point of view. <br /> <br /> The story is the story here (unlike the images, the actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) ends inadvertently with a microfilm of espionage in his possession after stealing Peters bag. (Say that three times!) Everyone, except Peters, is a credible character in this film: Widmark, the cops, the agents of the United States and the communists, and especially Ritter as "Moe", an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this movie. <br /> <br /> Peters does a decent job of interpreting the cheap floozy, but loses his credibility by "falling in love" with Widmark at the first meeting even though he is unpleasant to her. Only in the world of cinema! It's a shame, because that ridiculous part of history removes it. <br /> <br /> This is a black film average that means good, but not excellent, and certainly not worth buying at a price of $ 25- $ 35. For that price, one could do much better at the black cinema market.
