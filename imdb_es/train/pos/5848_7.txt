And I gave it a high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because he bloodied well. At the time there were so many OTHER programs that were related to toys / games, this program was unique because it had overlapping stories. As others have said here, he was ahead of his time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is the reason why the show was condemned. They have released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series so far. I hope more comes out. <br /> <br /> How does this compare when you see it now 20 years after it first came out? I do not know, I still like it despite the sometimes clumsy animation, and in my humble opinion it's just a flaw. The writing was almost first class and far ahead of the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I expect more DVDs or even a set of all the episodes in the right order ... The DVDs They are good, but I do not think the stories are in the right order, but despite this, the show shook.
