['The year 2000 was a bad year for Indian films due to the lack of quality and imagination of film directors. Apart from Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, nothing stood out. CCCC had a lot of setbacks due to the financing of the film and this without really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film in India and abroad. The only information given was that it was a thriller of suspense. The movie was released in 2001 and was surprisingly good. The main plot has to do with subrogation and is well managed. Salman and Preiti give a good performance where Salman does not take off his shirt ... they must be special effects! Rani plays Salman&#39;s wife, but is a slightly less demanding role compared to Preiti, who plays the prostitute, who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main drivers confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, that they have a solid chemistry on screen and off screen (apparently). Salman Khan, who is excellent, plays a serious role in the film as a successful businessman and it is a pity that he is being exploited as an aspiring comedian in his other films, as he is quite underestimated in the Mumbai film industry, in part due to the movies you choose. The character of Rani does not know that Preiti is a prostitute until the end ... this was hidden from her and the rest of the family ... the rest, you should find out, because it would ruin the film if I told you. The songs are all well illustrated, especially dekne walon and the title song. The other supporting actors make a minimal but fine effort like Salman&#39;s loving family. Abbas Mastan has produced a success and has handled the theme of the film with great tact. I say go and see it or rent what you prefer!']
