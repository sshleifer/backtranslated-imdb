Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of varying quality, but most of the films he made in his native country are undisputed masterpieces. This is the story of the alcoholic (and bisexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful and very strange rich woman. But the lady does not know that she is only interested in meeting the beautiful lover of the woman. Meanwhile, the writer is plagued by strange visions: at first they look like hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions. Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller, very original and provocative. I love movies that make you think they are about something, but then you realize that they are about something completely different. This is one of those movies; a thriller during the first half, and an almost religious surreal saga during the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography of the future director Jan de Bont. Highly recommended!
