These are the French and the Belgians doing what they do best. It is a peculiar narrative, visually inventive, stimulating and emotionally challenging. The director Jaco van Dormael takes us to the world of Georges, a patient with Down syndrome and his search for a meaningful relationship with someone, anyone. This is not done in a fatherly manner, but with a great sense of fun and also honesty. Georges' interaction with the guru of corporate management, Harry manages in a dazzling manner, moving from comedy to tragedy back to comedy with amazing ease. <br /> <br /> The Eighth Day offers a similar Hollywood meal as Rain Man or Robert, Oscar winner of Barry Levinson Forrest Gump of Zemeckis is well and truly in the shade. Sometimes, it evokes the humor of Milos Forman, Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest with nuances of Dennis Potter to a large extent. <br /> <br /> As the yuppie emotionally dull and desperately alone, Harry, Daniel Autuuil surrenders. another sublime performance more. But it is equaled by the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It's a movie with uniformly strong performances and many memorable pieces: the shoe shop scene, the auto show room, George's dance to Genesis's "Jesus He Knows Me", the scene of the conference, the scene of fireworks. If you have not seen it, there is only one thing to do. Rent it or attend a screening in a retro cinema near you and see what you have been missing. Better yet, buy this movie. Pure genius .....
