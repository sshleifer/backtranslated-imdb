This movie provides the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock. He, Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane are the central characters. <br /> <br /> When the Civil War closes, Lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would increase if people followed the advice "Go West, young," which, fortunately, the film did not erroneously attribute to Horace Greeley, as others did. But then, he is murdered, and some financiers speculate that they can enrich themselves by selling weapons to American Indians. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who interacts with a small child, while The Steamboat is loading on a pier along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife, which eventually gives the child, calling him "Arkansas stick", which was actually a different type of knife, although both were used across the border. <br /> <br /> Hickock Finally meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks like the photographs and paintings of the real man. Cody just got married and is taking his wife to the Old West to settle. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at their destination, they meet Calamity Jane, who is in love with Hickock. She looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill: "Is this your nonsense?" The line was the one that caused some problem to the Board of Hayes, since a definition of "mopsy" was a prostitute. Demille wanted the line, and one of her assistants pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's books about Peter Rabbit, three of the rabbits were Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit of bad virtue." It worked; the line remained. <br /> <br /> The Indians were becoming uneasy, partly because of the superior armament they got from the agent of the East financiers. Cody and Hickock were asked to help explore the area, so that troops could safely pass through a besieged area. Cody led the troops; Hickock went to see the activities of an Indian chief, who was an old acquaintance, and who was leading some of the hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> Calamity Jane is captured, and Hickock is captured trying to save her. They take them to the boss, and although neither of them would talk, the torture applied to Hickock breaks Calamity Jane's willpower, and she tells him the route Cody is using. <br /> <br /> The two are released, and Hickock joins Cody. and their forces, partly to alert them, are walking in a trap. With the help of Hickok, they stop the Indian attack. <br /> <br /> Hickock decides to go after the arms brokers, and finally takes them prisoner. While they wait for the authorities, Hickock is shot to death in the back while playing cards. <br /> <br /> There are numerous historical anomalies in the film, but it retains the flavor of the legend. Pretty good for the 1930s.
