This is something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup d'etat and a couple of Irish documentary filmmakers are inside it. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being openly slandered by the private media as a dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc. ., without repercussion on the part of the governments (as, for example, to silence them by means of bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods.). Oh, and they still claim that they are being suppressed, of course. <br /> <br /> See how the media rejoice over their role in the coup d'etat on television after the government was overthrown with the help of Rouge Generals (how much stupider can you get?). <br /> <br /> And see how the people of Venezuela march to the palace, holding the constitution in their hands and reinstating their elected government. <br /> <br /> This sounds like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it really happened, against the explicit wishes of the United States. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, filmed from the center of the action, acute and totally shameful for the main supporters of the coup: the United States, good, democratic, freedom-loving and benevolent (who still channel large amounts of money to the political opponents of Ch√°vez). ). <br /> <br /> Also very entertaining and exciting. 10 points.
