This is my short room of Joe McDoakes that I have seen and so far the most fun. In this, Joe takes voice lessons from an album that passes for Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, by the way), he asks Jack Carson for directions that confuse them both. Then he meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes), who speaks in his most normal voice, which is not far from his last Geroge Jetson and arrives on the set where he automatically annoys the director. I'll stop there and just tell you how funny I found everything and I was fascinated by the cameos of movie stars that are near the end. The final scene was especially eye-catching so on that note, go to YouTube if you want to see So you want to be in Picutres!
