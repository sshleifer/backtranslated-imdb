['I enjoyed this movie and I hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am in my fifties and I have many friends in the music business ... who are still trying to become adults ... no more fans, groupies, money, etc. ... and they are having difficulty adapting to everyday life ... when they see new bands, etc. they focus ... it&#39;s like they have to start over again ... this movie is a testament to what many of the old rockers of the 70s and 80s are going through now ... and that&#39;s where the film seems sad and depressing. BUT portrays the life of an old rock star, abandoned and lost, in a credible way. The young woman who arrives at her decrepit home reminds me of Hollis maclaren (outrageous) ... and she is a woman in a movie that you will cheer. This film is a must for people in the 50s who have seen the rise and fall of bands, people who knew members and saw them suffer as age progresses, and popularity wanes. This is an almost perfect movie ... but in a positive way ... because of the whales. YOU MUST SEE IT!']
