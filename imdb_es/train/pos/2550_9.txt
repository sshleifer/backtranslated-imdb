This is truly one of the "Golden Age" of Hollywood, the kind they no longer do. It is a unique and funny movie that keeps you guessing what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfectly chosen and they are all great support actors. This is the first movie I saw with Ronald Colman and since then I've been a fan of him. Reginald Gardiner has always been one of my favorite support actors and adds a certain quality to each film he is in. While he played a different kind of character here, he still added something to the movie that another actor in this character would not have. additional.
