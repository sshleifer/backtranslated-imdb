Sunday would not be a Sunday without an action movie, and when you want intense combat, you turn to Tom Berenger (Squad). <br /> <br /> Here he plays a sniper in the jungle and goes after the rebels and the drug lords. Life is a bitch, so she gets a kind of green office (Billy Zane) to help with the mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who stunned Anaconda. He does not do much better here, but Berenger makes the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Sure, it can be a little long, who wants to see walking through the jungle, but is it good? Tense action when the time comes.
