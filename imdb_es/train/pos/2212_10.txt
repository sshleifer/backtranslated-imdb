MY! Television is a great channel and Talk Soup is so fun that, in an instant, you can see how the episodes change. We want the funniest writings of the best writer of all time, Stan Evans ... The patron saint of the mindless masses ... He is a truly talented and talented writer, actor, comic, producer, director and creative consultant. Anna Nicole loved him. but he was not a multimillionaire $$$$ so he left it for a billionaire. Many superstars wanted to make movies with actor Stan Evans, who has a performance style "Humphrey Bogart" (Clark Gable). I should do many more movies. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or maybe with many other talented producers. We wish you a moment of FAME with a great fortune to win. Have you produced any simulations of U dramas? Or maybe some docudrama? A project about Bernie Madhoff would be a great television movie written by STAN EVANS. How many scripts have you written? Are you under $$$$$$$$$$$$$ billions of contracts with Disney? I should win more than $ 50 million ... I could also write a television movie about the late KING OF POP ... Michael Jackson. We want to see much more of Stan Evans in the movies and on television. Thank you. Elvis has left the building !!!!!
