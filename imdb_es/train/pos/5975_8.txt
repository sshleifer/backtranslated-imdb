Every film critic and metal head hated this movie, but I enjoyed it. I saw this when I was a kid on TV somewhere and I was surprised by the scene where Sammi appears on the stage and plays Trick or Treat by Fastway. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was typical of the '80s, the boy is pushed by the thugs and he recruits supernatural help to beat the thugs, but he goes very far and must be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Matt from Melrose Place chooses Skippy from Family Ties so that Skippy gets a record of Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to comfort him. and hell is lost, the climax is where Tony sings (synchronizes lips) and dances a metal song before the rudder hits the fan. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of mistakes and those things, but the music and the overall image was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
