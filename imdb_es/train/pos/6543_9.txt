I read all Nancy Drew as a pre-teen and I collect the books as an adult. I loved the effect used at the end (and a little at the beginning) of the film where the line drawings in the style of the books were transformed into scenes from the film. It was an elegant way to point out the connections between film situations and books. For example, the scenes with the seller of oriental antiques remind a lot of the scenarios that I remember from the books. I thought Ned was a perfect cast, and Emma Roberts was a wonderful interpretation of Nancy Drew of the 21st century. (Like Betty Crocker's picture, she keeps up with the times!)
