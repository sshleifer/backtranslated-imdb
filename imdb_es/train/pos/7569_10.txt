In a moment of our culture where the reality exposed as narrative is an overwhelming fiction as we know it on the small and big screen, "Apart from that" is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest, fresh and innovative in their presentation that I've never seen before. The usual spoon-feeding conventions do not exist in this movie, leaving a happy audience to sit and watch these real-life moments dripping one after the other on the screen. While watching the film, and even after contemplation, it's hard to believe that these incredible performances are really that. Every moment with the great cast of actors felt as if the truth was exposed in their daily lives. Even so, "Apart from that" it does not feel like a documentary or a television in reality, but transcends a category of its own, with its unique cinematography and direction. I hope to see this new category of narration continue with other films by the directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen.
