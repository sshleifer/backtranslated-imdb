This movie took me by surprise. My friend told me that this movie was a "movie for girls". Boy, I was wrong! This movie has a great family attraction, without sex scenes like other movies. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job in the shoes of Homer Hickam. The cast is also great. <br /> <br /> Science, maturity, family disputes, a great train scene ... This movie has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the score is quite pitted. The music of the 50 throws the film at the edge of greatness. <br /> <br /> The DVD is definitely worth its weight in carbon. The repetition value is great, I've seen it several times.
