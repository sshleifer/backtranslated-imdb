Since I'm so interested in the lake monsters I really dug this movie. This movie is worth seeing. If you like such horrible movies that are good, take a look. The effects are really good, so just think "Land of the Lost". Originally I saw this movie in the early 90s, maybe more like 89/90 in a local channel monster show called "Morgus Presents". I was not scared, but I was 8 years old and B felt more like an A. Years later, I saw it on a DVD in a local Circuit City and I bought it immediately so I could give it a 9 because it has a personal space in my heart. there with the Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good B movie fun for all ages.
