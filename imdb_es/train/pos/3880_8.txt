Well, to begin with, this was the most elegant Clausen movie to date. <br /> <br /> The man always has a sense for the characters with a bit of humor for them, but I think that in this film is added an unparalleled dimension to whatever he has done before. His work, in very black and white words, has been accepted by the wide audience but not so critical, and we have always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a different way of allowing the audience to know what Need to say. <br /> <br /> In "Villa Paranoia, however, for the first time, surprises with an invisible wisdom and respect for minorities, not only the ethnic people but also the normal people you know. 'the country', it's about the eternal problem of lack of love, but in a close and brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused, and besides that, he himself manages to play ab **** ** d! A real b ***** d, who wants the right thing but has no idea how to get there, and the people, therefore, suffer, bitterly. <br /> <br /> I must say that It's one of the best movies I've seen this year and I'm looking forward to your next one.
