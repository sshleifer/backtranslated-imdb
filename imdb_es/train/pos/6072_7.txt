Branagh and Fishburne offer excellent performances in this version of Shakespeare's classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I've seen him in the cinema or on stage. Some might say that this movie is too focused on the subject, but I do not agree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in the history of cinema, offers powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as Moor of Venice can be one of his best performances. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the simple subtraction of a series of important scenes. The character of Desdemona has much less depth than he has in the work. In this movie, it might not be added at all. One of the worst cuts made by Branagh in this film was the subtraction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the work shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child represented in this film. There was a series of subtractions that damaged the integrity of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you have not read the play or have not seen a film version of Othello before, I recommend this movie. The story, cut or not, is still incredibly exciting. The performance, as stated above, is very good. If some important scenes had been added, and Desdemona's character had been prioritized a bit more, this would be a great movie. In its current form, it remains an admirable version of the original. I give a marginal recommendation.
