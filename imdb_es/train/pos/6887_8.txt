This is a unique and bold film. He is energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performances. <br /> <br /> I love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look inside, ask questions and dig beneath the surface. Because of the nature of the film, it practically demands that the viewer also look inward. It may take some courage to do this. I can see how some closed-minded people can find this quite disturbing. However, I found it stimulating, much more than entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is truly an original filmmaker, with vision. I'm curious to see what he'll do next. <br /> <br /> Look at it.
