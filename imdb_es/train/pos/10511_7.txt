['&quot;Emma Woodhouse&quot; Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself, but painting, going with her friends in her car up and down, greeting the people of the city and trying to match everyone those he knows. I guess there were no movies, no television in those days, and the girls had nothing to do but gossip. I wish she had read a little more. I like Gwyneth and I think she&#39;s a lovely young woman. She has talent, and in &quot;Emma&quot; one has the privilege of listening to Gwyneth sing. I really want to see &quot;Duets&quot;, where she is supposed to sing. He is brave to speak British English with all those native Britons, including Emma Thompson&#39;s sister, &quot;Miss Bates&quot; Sophie Thompson (Four weddings and a funeral, dancing in Lughnasa). &quot;Mrs. Elton&quot; Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American royalty, being the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony Winner of the Blythe Award Danner (The myth of fingerprints). Hopefully it&#39;s for a long time. Good luck with us! I liked Emma and I also recommend it. It is one of those old stories that are still accurate in those days. Favorite scenes: Emma singing and playing the piano. I especially like it when she sings a duet. Favorite phrases: Mr. Knightley &quot;: Emma, you did not ask me to contribute an enigma&quot;. Emma: &quot;Your whole personality is a riddle, Mr. Knightley, I thought you were overqualified.&quot; Miss Bates: &quot;I left you speechless, I was speechless, and we have not stopped talking about it since then.&quot;']
