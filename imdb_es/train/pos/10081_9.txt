This is a beautiful, rich and very well executed film with a rich and meaningful story. Basically, it explains how an old master narrator needs to find an heir (masculine) to carry out his trade, but ends up without getting what he expected in his world dominated by men. The characters must deal with their situation and the old teacher must deal with the conflict between his desire for a partner and an heir and the traditional notions of him and society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and complex. The exploration of the characters, their lives and emotions is rich and compelling. The development of the character is strong, while the characters are complex and not one-dimensional. The film expertly exposes the elder's emotions and desire to find an heir, and convincingly shows how he and the child handle the situation. There is also humor, sometimes quite subtle, at the appropriate points. The film also examines the good and the bad of traditional Chinese culture, creating greater interest and depth for the film. <br /> <br /> The direction, the acting and the stage are exceptional. Added to the other strengths, this creates rich and compelling visual images and compelling real characters. As a result, the film evokes great empathy and feelings towards the characters. <br /> <br /> Some claim that the ending weakens the film, but I do not necessarily agree. Maybe it could have been stronger with a different ending, but any improvement in the overall movie would have been quite small.
