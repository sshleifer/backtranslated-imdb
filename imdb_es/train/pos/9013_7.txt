Although this movie has some weaknesses, it's worth watching. I chose it by the cast, and I applaud Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing different roles from the ones they took in the past. Both portray very problematic people, complete with warts, but make them sympathetic because of their humanity. The story is moving, but it is the performances that take off. The "Jane" of Bonham Carter is a remarkable achievement, whose search for romance opened my eyes to aspects of disability that I had not thought of before, but which were also interesting for other reasons. I felt that the film ended too abruptly, but better than an emotionally manipulative ending (see "Stepmother"). The real English environment was added to my enjoyment: it was England in the 90s, both urban and rural, without being depressing. .
