It is really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, sports and hockey players. This film is the second superlative Canadian film I've seen in recent weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), much better than all, except the best efforts of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is anything but that; He is an employee of the middle-aged Parsi bank in Bombay in the 1970s. This film sensitively explores various things that happen to him about his family, his friends and his work, and its effect on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating and, I suppose, accurate portrait of the middle class of urban life in India at that time. <br /> <br /> However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as you might expect, can not capture all the complexities of the book, but if you want to read a really good book and watch a really good movie, read and see "Such a long journey."
