I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that had never happened before: a Secret Service agent who was becoming bad and involved in a murder plot. Unfortunately, for the character of Michael Douglas, "Pete Garrison", they think that HE is the mole, but he is not. <br /> <br /> He's just a morally flawed agent who has an affair with the First Lady! Since he is doing that, he can not give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect he is number one when it is revealed that there is a plot to kill the President. <br /> <br /> "Garrison" is forced to take risks. but, at the same time, he keeps trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. Douglas does a good job in this role. I do not always care about the people who play, but he's an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is just as good (at least here) as the other SS chief who pursues Douglas until he is convinced he has told the truth. When he does, they both work together in the end to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. Thieves are interesting too, by the way. Also, never, and unfortunately, I will never see a First Lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger. <br /> <br /> This is simply a skilful action movie that entertains from start to finish. Are there holes in it? Of course; Probably some of them, and one reason why you see so many critical comments. However, here he is unfairly beaten. It just is not smart enough for the geniuses here on this website. My advice: relax, just go with it and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, it gets a bit of Rambo at the end but, otherwise, it has high ratings for entertainment ... that's what movies are about.
