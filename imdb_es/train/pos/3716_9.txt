I was invited to see Cracker Bag last night before a preview of Disney's Holes. I do not know who decided to show it, but I'm very happy that they did. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot of Australia in the early 80's, seen through the eyes of a child. The "conversations" between Eddie and his brother were very funny and, like the rest of the film, so faithful to life. Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia, as it reminded me of my own childhood (being the same age as the director probably helps a bit) and the audio multiplied the feeling. I just hope I can see Cracker Bag again someday.
