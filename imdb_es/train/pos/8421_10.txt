Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about the silent Hollywood and the former imperial general to the Tsar of Russia, who is there. Emil Jannings won a well deserved Oscar, in part, for his role as the general who, ironically, is part of a silent image as a Russian general. The film goes back to his days in Russia before the fall of the country to the revolutionaries. William Powell makes his big-screen debut as the Hollywood director who plays Jannings in his film. The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and an imitation of behind the scenes at Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg offers another classic, and is full of the great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
