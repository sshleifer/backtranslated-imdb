I do not care how many negative reviews purple rain gets, this movie is cool! Excellent movie, it has everything, excellent music (Prince of coarse!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad, very moving movie. I do not want to say much more, I do not want to reveal the plot, but I will say this: the film is VERY realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, many families similar to El represented in the film. I see this as very realistic and so real, it makes the film so much more exciting. My generation loved this movie as it grew, many of us love Prince and there is a lot to relate to any teenager who has had similar problems. <br /> <br /> That said, it's definitely not just a teen movie, I'd recommend it to all age groups. And not everything is so dark, the film has good music, scenes of the band's performance and attractive and funny scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
