A standout for Pacino's interpretation of the speech about the coffin of the dead child; Mark Antony of Shakespeare would be ashamed! <br /> <br /> Was Paul Schrader or was it Ken Lipper who should be congratulated for the remarkable dialogues? They are rich and smart and well worth their time if you like movies with good scripts. I found that the narrative of the story developed quite well until the postscript went off. <br /> <br /> There's not much more to talk about in this movie; even John Cusack has done better than this. Interestingly, the film is very oriented towards men, women are mere appendages.
