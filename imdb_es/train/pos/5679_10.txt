After the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time, instead of Tudor or Elizabethanad, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominee Rowan Atkinson) lives at the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but adorable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "faithful" butler of George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series, the wonderfully written play comedy Blackadder tries his best to become rich and powerful. Try to choose a man for a rotten neighborhood, try to sell a book, try to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, try to be a man of the road and finally posing as the Prince. This is a very good delivery of the popular comedy. Includes appearances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. He won the BAFTA for Best Comedy Series, and was nominated for Best Design and Best Makeup. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 in The 50 Greatest British Actors, Number 24 in The Comedians' Comedian, and Number 8 in Britain's favorite comedian, Edmund Blackadder was number 3 in The 100 Greatest TV Characters, and was the number 3 in The best comedy characters in the world, and Blackadder (the four series) was number 2 in the Best British Comedy. Exceptional!
