An unforgettable piece in which the fan of the most demanding horror film will fall with gratitude. Keep your Freddy and your Jasons: this movie is in the same company as "The Haunting" (the original). Lyrical and truthful, it stays with you until late at night, like those terrifying shows of CBS Radio Mystery Theater. A smart rental.
