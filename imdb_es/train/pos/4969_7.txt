['It&#39;s wonderful to see that Shane Meadows is already exerting international influence. LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: the vague class identity that works above but well below half, the deranged father, the abandoned urban environment, the adult sense. failure, the barely hidden fascism that sustains modern urban life. <br /><br /> But if Meadows is a formalistic expert, Mariage exchanges images, and her monochrome frames, exquisitely surreal and coldly composed, serve to distance the dirty and gloomy subject, which, like Meadows, deviates from the high farce to the tragedy in question of seconds. <br /><br /> There are longueurs and clich√©s, but Poelvoorde is incredibly insane, a common man with ordinary ambitions, whose attempts to perform them are dangerous; while individual pieces: the explosions of popcorn / popcorn; the best marriage sequence since the dead and the dead manage to snatch the epiphany of despair.']
