It seems that Patten is not the friendliest guy and seems to resent the additional work that will be the visit of Fanshawe; The large empty house provides an infinite amount of cooking, cleaning and maintenance.

They used to belong to a local man named Baxter, who seemed to have picked up bones and skulls from Gallows Hill, boiled them for one mix or another, Baxter had mysteriously disappeared one night, the late Squire had acquired his belongings, including a mask of a skull and some old engravings of the area. These engravings fascinate Fanshawe when they portray the Abbey that he sees through his binoculars, but discovers that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of Henry VII, so it would be impossible for Baxter to draw the sketches, however, they are signed. and dated by Baxter in the recent past, so he concludes that binoculars have a special power.

In time to help or save Fanshawe from his fate? The series of films of Ghost Story for Christmas made by the BBC sadly ended its first series of films in 1978 with The Ice House, which for the most part were based on the work of the great Mr. R. James. In 2005 and 2006, the series was revived briefly and, fortunately, A View from a Hill also marked a return to the work of James, whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers. Director Luke Watson being new to the series may have worried fans of the older films, but he returns to the era setting left by later films that immediately set the tone for a great Ghost story, his direction is assured while stays faithful to the The mood of the teachers works and gradually increases the fear factor to a frightening climax, keeping everything that the viewer sees to the minimum, thus increasing the tension and mystery. The autumn countryside offers a lot of atmosphere, the falling leaves and the low sun provide a disturbing scenario for the sinister events that lie ahead. It must be said that the cast is excellent and is perfectly distributed in their respective roles. The idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective, the use of a man-made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye can not see, may even have influenced Alex de la Iglesia in his film La habitaci√≥n del child (2006) of The following year, with which it has similar similarity. I had heard mixed reviews of this particular film, but I must say that I found it intriguing at all times and it even raised some hairs on my head and gave me some chills, something that does not happen much these days, I think. Any negativity that surrounds the film can only be attributed to its rhythm, which to my eyes is perfection, but for the modern public it will be considered extremely slow. There is a lot of time, even in its brief 40 minutes, for the development of the character and the expansion of the plot, and I must say that it is one of my favorites and, without a doubt, one of the best films of the decade .
