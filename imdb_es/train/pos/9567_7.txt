I saw the DVD of this movie that also comes with an excellent comment track (in English). It seems that in Cambodia (English subtitles say the character speaks Thai, but the film says Cambodia), a very violent evil man is educating the children to become killers who use starvation and train them to fight and kill . He sends Pang to kill some people in China and, during the murders, a policeman's partner is killed. Policeman Wai is a loose cannon that is worried about his father, who is also a policeman who was shot and is in a coma. Wai's boss is his father's friend and is concerned about Wai's erratic behavior. He does not know that Wai was the one who caught his father when dealing with drug traffickers, he shot him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and hides in a squalid dump hut where he meets a woman who came here to find his mother and keeps repeating that his father does not let her go (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand this, but saves her from it The father who seems to be having sex with her, maybe this is the reason why Cat III appears). Wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to their house where they are married and she gets pregnant, Wai follows him and joins the evil man (who is training the children) making a deal to fight and train so he can catch Pang. There is a great confrontation between Wai and Pang with the terribly battered woman, the main victim, and leaving Wai dead and Pang cutting off his son from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the next possible child to be raised as a murderer. This movie is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many violent scenes very brutal. The woman who has a long fingernail taken from her foot. Knives for the neck and torso. Guns fired directly at the head. And several very intense beatings. Maybe it's very intense and strong, but it's definitely worth seeing.
