** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Most of the movie that does not work is the Wendigo, and when your title character fails, your movie usually does not fall behind. The filmmakers' interpretation of the Wendigo form is interesting, and can be adequately threatening when filmed correctly, when the fleeing killer sees Wendigo in a flash in his rearview mirror, for example, and the tree shape was really very good However, as a monster character never comes alive. We do not receive much explanation for their behavior, and what we SEE does not match the story told in the film itself or with the Wendigo story that I have read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons why the monster fails is that you do not get enough to do it, in the movie. When this film is reduced to your bones, what you have is a thriller of suspense with a little supernatural element, instead of a movie about a monster. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is good, although a little cheesy; the filmmakers use the stage, the lighting and the time of day to convey the atmosphere and the mood quite well. The character of Otis is presented as truly dangerous and unpredictable, which makes him the real monster of the film. It could have been more effective to explain his behavior when he was possessed by the hungry spirit of Wendigo, which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend. <br /> <br /> I've heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason why the Wendigo does not do much is that, when the monster suit was built, it ended up being so heavy and uncomfortable (to mimic his posture on the helmets, the artist had to walk on the toes) that it was almost impossible to run, walk or act on it. Therefore, the many flashes of the creature stopped and the obvious acceleration of the creature is running. I emphasize that these reports are not confirmed.
