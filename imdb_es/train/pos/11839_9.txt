This movie was very entertaining. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is that Brian Adams does all the songs in French as well. The score is also encouraging and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of a combination of traditional animation, combined with computer-generated images. The result is really impressive. I watch this movie at least once a week with my children and we never get tired. The story is compelling and well told. <br /> <br /> I do not understand anyone who would rate this movie with less than 7. Definitely, a guardian in my home.
