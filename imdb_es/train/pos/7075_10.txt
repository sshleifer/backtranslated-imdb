The paradoxes of time are the trap of the devil for underemployed minds. They are fun to consider in a 'what if?' sort of way Filmmakers and authors have dealt with this over and over again in a lot of movies and TV shows that include 'Star Trek: First Contact', the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill's Excellent Adventure and Ted ',' Groundhog Day 'and Stargate SG1 tribute,' Window of Opportunity '. "All You Zombies" by Heinlein, was written decades ago and will still make people read that story for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the case of the excellent film by Terry Gilliam, '12 Monkeys', it is difficult to establish what the problems of continuity may be with respect to the elements of the plot destined to make us rethink our conception of the movie. The repeated presentations will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, seeing the film for the first time, will consider Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as "the continuing harrowing experience" that visited time travel. <br /> <br /> Unlike other time travel stories, '12 Monkeys' is not clear if Future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that the time can not be changed, but scientists intercepted a phone call he made from the airport AFTER being sent back to 1996, on his own timeline personal. <Br /> <br /> Even this could be interpreted as an event that had to occur in a single timeline universe, to ensure that the timeline is not altered ... Cole has to die before the eyes of his youngest child yourself so that the destiny is realized. If that is the case, time is like a fluid, always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces that work in it. It's hard for the mind to think too much about this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> If you can change the future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people to the past, as we see on board The plane at the end of the film, then that means that the future It CAN be changed by manipulating past events ... or not? The movie has probably led to many drunken fights in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians.
