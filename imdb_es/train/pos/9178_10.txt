I have to say that this was always one of my favorites when I went to see my grandmother. And it still is. It is very, very close to the book. The way it was filmed, and the players were excellent! I have to recommend this movie to everyone who has not seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hates television movies, but this was really great! I gave it 10/10.
