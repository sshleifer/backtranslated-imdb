"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of hit comedy and strange that has laughs and "huh?". But I suggest giving it a try. I think it is very overlooked. Not many people give this film a chance. It works Just think of it as a little parody of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does it well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. He simply makes his way from the great chiefs to a beautiful wife. And, of course, like many of the mafia films, someone wants him dead. 90% of the jokes laugh. Like, I said give it a try. Just take your favorite gangster movies and mix a comedy. You have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
