The stage and the actors make of this film for television the best interpretation of the classic story of Dickens. George C. Scott is very credible like the rest of the cast. His Scrooge is full of evil until the end of the movie. Then his character changes to one who is truly repentant. The English city of the nineteenth century chosen for the stage creates an environment that fits Dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film. It's a movie that I see every Christmas along with the real Grinch and It's A Wonderful Life.
