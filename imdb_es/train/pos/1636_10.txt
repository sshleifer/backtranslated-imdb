This is one of the best movies of the 80s !!! It stands out as a "turd in a punchbowl"! I can not believe Mad Magazine has reported it or whatever. And yet, they take pride in putting their name on a show with "Stuart," "Chinese lady who does not speak to anyone," and "UPS guy at speed." What's up with that? And, I LOVE Ron Leibman, he's cunning! Do you wonder why your name was taken from the credits? It was his funniest role I know. Of course, he's not as shrewd as he was in Norma Rae. But, in my opinion, this film is up to the national holidays of Lampoon. If you liked movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin or any of the other 80 movies focused on teenagers, you'll love it! Rent and you will see what I want to say !!
