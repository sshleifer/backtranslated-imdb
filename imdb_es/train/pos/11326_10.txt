I've seen the first 17 episodes and this series is just amazing! I have not been so interested in an anime series since Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on a game h, which I'm not sure if it's been done before or not, I have not played the game, but from what I've heard it goes very well. <br /> <br /> I give this series a 10/10. It has a great story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've seen. It also has good Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series yet, take a look. You can find subbed episodes on some anime websites, it's outside of Japan.
