['Tim Meadows has to be the most underrated of SNL&#39;s most recent cast members. What was initially a low-brow look at a sleazy gigilo turns into a very entertaining 90-minute race, though it&#39;s still down. Do not blow up this movie waiting for a beautiful cinematography or performances worthy of an Oscar. Enter him expecting bright nonsense with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell doing what they do best, making the audience laugh. <br /><br /> Leon &quot;The Ladies&#39; Man&quot; Phelps is a naive and nice radio show host who knows very little about anything except the wang forms. As a man with gifted talent, he wastes the wives of innumerable gamers who have come together to hunt him down. The director does an inspired job of guiding the actors in a comic quote that completely compensates for the lack of development of the plot. How much plot would be expected from an SNL sketch? While some scenes are a bit out of place, for the most part, Meadows phrases and absurd sexual comments hit the funny bone. For example, in one scene, Meadows is compared to Mother Teresa, but for bonin &#39;. Of course it&#39;s ridiculous, but not everyone in the privacy of our homes laugh at their advice to an entire city to &quot;do it in the butt&quot;? In another scene, immediately after a sincere kiss with the female protagonist, she suddenly remembers that her name would be a benefactor, a woman she slept with years ago. He stands in front of the woman who has obviously fallen in love with him and proclaims that &quot;the Man of the Ladies is back&quot;, for his obvious displeasure. <br /><br /> Billy Dee Williams hits the ball outside the park as the bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell, the repressed homosexual, completes the solid performances. <br /><br /> Watch this movie if you like adult humor. If not, stay away from extreme prejudices.']
