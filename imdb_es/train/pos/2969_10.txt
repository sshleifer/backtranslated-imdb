['This movie is about two guys who invented a sport in the place trying to get 2 to get the hot girl. BASEketball becomes a national sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but he is hated when he loses the NBA against another rival team. Meet the girl of your dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. The first time I saw this movie I wet my pants was very funny. A must for all comedy fans. If you like South Park, you will love this! Maybe not seeing with children is inappropriate for small children. some faults give him 6 1/2 out of ten, I give him 11 out of ten. I like Coop He Rock. I have to go, bye, thanks for reading this.']
