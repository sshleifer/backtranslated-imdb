This is a great film from the lost era of the reactionary drama made for television. My favorite actor of all time, Robert Culp, cleverly traces a path through tense liberal impartiality and faith in the system, conservatism and fear of crime, and homicidal psychosis. Teenagers are a collection of pure and malicious stereotypes, and the final message of this movie makes the Dragnet episodes seem even in comparison. But what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie, gradually increasing the fear and paranoia, as well as the feeling of the whole California environment. The cars are also great, as I remember. I give this movie a 10, and challenge anyone to watch this movie and not enjoy every minute. Remember, just because it's made for television does not mean it's not a great art.
