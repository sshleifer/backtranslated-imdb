And also an unexpected plot, for the time: there is plague in the city of New Orleans, and only Richard Widmark can stop it! The most characteristic themes of Elia Kazan: water fronts, working men, crowds, fugitives, people with blue necks, violence in an alley, are shown here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is quite effective as the freezing mobster who gets out for a great score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise, somewhat grumpy, but he can certainly be seen as his agent. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as the unconditional and good wife; I thought that she and Widmark were a credible couple. <br /> <br /> He himself always reminds me of something to Sinatra, in the face and in the calm and intense way, and that is understood as a compliment in any case. I had never heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire the performance of Widmark. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas; It seemed that he played this role many times, they form an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> The plague itself is a McGuffin, and you should know that it is not exactly how it was done. I've been in real life, instead of small scale, at least, right? -but I found that he carried the plot very well. <br /> <br /> Check this. It's good. *** outside ****
