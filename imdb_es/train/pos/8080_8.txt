['Well, I get used to reading comments about these films that do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous films. He was an intransigent villain, a villain with no apologies. For me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role in which his villainy is not undermined in any way. <br /><br /> The child who played Aryan was probably on his head with this cast. There I think maybe the director could have done better. But, to be honest, the best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an unknown heroine, a true theater veteran who is overqualified for each function that is offered. But I must say that I greatly appreciated your contribution in interpreting Virendra Sahi&#39;s wife. He can be given little to do, but he does it all with total conviction. I&#39;m sure she sailed over the heads of the majority of the audience. <br /><br /> So, if you have the habit of making do with the Bollywood average, you will not get much of this movie. But if you constantly look for something else, then this could give you something of what you have been missing.']
