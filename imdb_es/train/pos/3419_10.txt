After having "welcomed home" my 23 year old daughter in a year in Iraq, in the medical support unit of Camp Anaconda, I felt obliged to receive this DVD. I wanted to hear the feelings of other veterans to try to better understand their mentality upon arrival and not wait until something bad happened. Regardless of your opinion of war and peace, this film serves as a great start for all Americans to begin to recover from the emotional emptiness of our returning veterans. The main statement of the whole movie is "Act" on the problem. Incredibly emotional movie. I would recommend this movie to the vet to the entire veterinarian's mature family and ask them to move forward with a plan to listen comfortably to veterans returning from the Gulf War. <br /> <br /> Let's move forward almost a year later. My daughter has seen this DVD. He took into account his emotions and, in fact, he has committed to renew for another 6 years. His take on the time he spent in the arena is that he did something good. The local children of Balad received first-class medical treatment for several common ailments that normally can not be allowed with an escort and a translator. His look on his shoulder on his tour of Iraq was. "We changed some hearts and minds back there" Great DVD, you must keep an open mind and see all sides
