['This is a bit of a puzzle for many Lynch artistic people. They tend to try to write this as a kind of parallel project, crude and meaningless Lynch. This is how Lynch passes gas between his true pieces of cinematographic art. Well, it can be a fart, but it&#39;s one of those intriguing farts that you realize and you&#39;re ashamed to admit you enjoy. <br /><br /> Dumbland distilled beyond this is art. What can you do with aspects of modern life, but laugh about it? If you take it seriously you would go crazy. You get hooked on it, you smell it, you taste it, you feel its agonies, its irrational stupidities, and then you express it in whatever medium you choose. That&#39;s called art, and art is not stupid. But it&#39;s Dumbland.']
