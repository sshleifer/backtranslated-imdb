Although it was obviously a low budget production, it is worth watching the performances and songs of this film. One of Walken's few musical roles to date. (He is a wonderful dancer and singer and also demonstrates his acrobatic skills, watch the car wheel!) Also starring Jason Connery. A great children's story and very nice characters.
