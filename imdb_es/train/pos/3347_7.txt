['Robert Mitchum plays Clint Tollinger in this short but hard western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional tamer of the city, as in the case of when a city needs someone to save himself; He is the one who is brought to do it. The last concert of Tollinger is presented as an accident: walking through the city in search of his old adventure, he runs into a city where a local gangster from the west plays a puppet. But many citizens begin to regret the day they hired Tollinger, as their way of cleaning the city becomes very demanding (suddenly, High Plains Drifter seems less original). <br /><br /> Man With The Gun begins as an average film of hard men from the west, but it starts to surprise you more and more as the film progresses. What begins as forgetful and ordinary becomes dark and focused on character. The whole movie is very well shot and the cast is very nice. Mitchum is his excellent habitual self here in Man With The Gun; It is not one of your best performances. Mitchum still has his classic and effective rugged, high-speed on-screen presence and plays the action-packed, meaningful and shocking scenes of The Movie just outside the park. Man With The Gun is a nice Western Mitchum and worth the time.']
