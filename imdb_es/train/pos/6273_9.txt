I really loved this movie, yes, I know it was pretty unlikely, there's no way that Shelby's car could have stayed on the road, as well as the 540i with all its traction control and other gadgets, but other than that, the set The movie was well set. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast was also quite good, with the exception of the Brit Bad Guy, it was too "too much", do not you think? Anyway, great movie, great cars and great acting. On the one hand, I made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remote controlled garage that night. :)
