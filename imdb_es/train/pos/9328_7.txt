The Perfect Son is a story about two brothers of 30 years, one that apparently is "perfect" and the other that is basically a mistake, and often accommodates in drug rehabilitation centers. After the death of their father, the two reunite after a long absence and the usual rivalry between brothers reappears. It is not until the "perfect" brother makes the surprising revelation that he has AIDS that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to put his life in order and assume a certain responsibility. <br /> <br /> The movie does. a good job of chronicling the "return" of the younger brother, although at times it may seem a little exaggerated (overcoming drug addiction is never so easy). What makes the film more delicate is the treatment of AIDS, a subject that has become a bit of a pastime in movies in the last 5-10 years. And also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two brothers who were fighting before is very credible and well done. The two main actors were very competent, although not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> A solid first effort by director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose own brother died of AIDS. The ending is also well done. <br /> <br />
