This is a decent little movie made in Michigan, about a man who is obsessed by his past, with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and who has grown up not so well adapted. In fact, it's absolutely crazy, but try not to be too obvious. He also has an entourage, his own little demon and angel who follow him. The devil never says a word, but in reality, he does not have to, and he's Max Schreck, creepy. Let's say the angel rolls his wheels a lot on this, since Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like "releasing" the people he decides they need, mostly beautiful young people. This is a decent portrait of madness, and at some point you are alone to realize what is happening, but in general, I saw it from the beginning to the end very concentrated in the film because it definitely caught my attention. . It's a bit lacking in some areas, but nothing that I can really say. A decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer movies.
