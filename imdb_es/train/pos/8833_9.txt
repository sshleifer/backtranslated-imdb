I was intrigued by the title, so during a small insomnia attack (fueled by my curiosity ...), I stayed awake and watched it. Then I checked my TV listings and saw it again! There is a very obvious realization that occurred to me when I saw this film: despite politics, traditions, culture, etc., teenagers everywhere are practically the same. The characters of the children of Belgrade could have been transported, say, somewhere in the Midwestern United States during the same period and, apart from language differences, it would be impossible to distinguish them from any of the local adolescents of that time. Of course, they showed the same problems and concerns, with politics aside: music, sex, film idols, music, drinks, sports, music ... In fact, almost the same things that occupied my time growing up in the south of California in 1970.. <br /> <br /> This was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable. The characters, especially the young actors, were completely believable as well. I will not say that this was the Yugoslavian "American Graffiti", but I will say that it fits very well with other films from the 50s.
