The United States was still fighting against World War II (the film was released between the VE day and the VJ day). Any worthwhile study was making wrestling movies where the intrepid American soldiers beat the enemy or the Americans in general sang and danced. The Technicolor musicals were what the United States thrived on the depressing days when everything was rationed. Most of the musicals of the day were simply a group of musical numbers united with the best available plot introduced to complete the time until the next musical number! Now I have the feeling that all the people who are reviewing this movie were born after 1970. Depressing how quickly we forget. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been called "The search for José Iturbi", but now everyone wonders why. . Let me explain. From 1929, his arrival in the United States, until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the best pianists to decorate a concert stage. He agreed to make some movies in 1942, but Hollywood had pursued him for almost a decade at that time. Not only an excellent pianist, but also a successful conductor, Iturbi was a very familiar word for more than 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned from the beginning, and has anyone noticed that the other pianists were all children? Joe Pasternak, who produced that film and many other MGM musicals, attributed to Iturbi the interesting American youth in classical music. Grayson's who wanted an audition with Iturbi in the film was no different from real life at the time. Everyone wanted Iturbi back then. The joke among the soldiers was that "GI" meant "Get Iturbi" (he did many concerts at military bases). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra an excellent singer, but at the time of this film, Sinatra was only 30 years old and had only been under contract with Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already known as a dancer, but by then Iturbi had been a worldwide sensation for more than 20 years. <br /> <br /> And as for the lack of a plot, the Americans did not need the plot. They were tired of the war, they were sick with fear for their loved ones and worried about the future. They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would turn out well in the end. They needed music and smiles and joy and romance. This movie and similar ones delivered just what was needed. <br /> <br /> Sufficient conferences. Leaving aside the mouse dance, the best scene in the film occurs between Sinatra and Iturbi, and each of them "ignorantly" complements the other's music. <br /> <br /> If you have any interest in José Iturbi, the Spaniard who conquered more of America, along with De Soto, Cortez and De Leon, visit my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a summary of the plot, excerpts from movie reviews of the day and photos of this and other MGM. musicals of the 1940s, as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
