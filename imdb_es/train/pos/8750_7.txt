Brokedown Palace is the story of two of the best friends, Alice and Darlene, who travel to Thailand spontaneously and end up in jail after the drugs planted catch them in their luggage. In this way, the film had the potential to become a serious and moving film, like "Return to Paradise", but instead, the film chose to focus little on the situation of the girls and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale deliver excellent results, and the film is much more about the interaction between them: suspicion, jealousy, questioning and proof of their friendship and, ultimately, the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. . This film decides not to go too deep into politics or even into the harshness of life in prison (which is a little overlooked), and focuses more on these problems of friendship. <br /> <br /> There were some holes in the plot here, and some parts that just did not seem believable or realistic. We do not feel the real fear or despair of their situation as well as we could have done. And we have very little sense of life outside the walls of the prison, with Bill Pullman playing the supposedly sordid lawyer who really has a heart of gold. In short, this should, by all rights, have been a much darker film than it was. <br /> <br /> But in general, I enjoyed it. The performance was good, the soundtrack was perfect and the story had enough twists and turns to stay interesting. Worth seeing.
