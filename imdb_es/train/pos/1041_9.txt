Watch On The Rhine began as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman, who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still linked to Nazi Germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in August. 1939. Due to the fact that Hellman simply echoed the communist party line, the line did not change until a couple of months later. Actually, Lillian was months ahead of her time in this work. <br /> <br /> The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as the matriarch of the family and, most importantly, the villains George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. <br /> <br /> Lukas won a hat trick in 1943, winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and New York film critics for best actor. Probably, if the Tony Awards had existed, I would have won that too. The Oscar is even more remarkable if you consider who he faced, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper for For Whom the Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of his competitors was a bigger box office name than him. The nomination of Lukas is usually of the type that the Academy grants to complete a field. <br /> <br /> Jack Warner knew that was the reason why Mady Christians did not repeat his part of Broadway and the role of Lukas' wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was a particularly eye-catching role for her, but because she believed in the image and just wanted to be associated with it. It is the same reason why he did The man who came to dinner, a much lighter work than this one. <br /> <br /> Davis is the daughter of a US Supreme Court judge who married a German citizen in the days of Weimar. . After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas and his three children come to America, which has not yet entered the European war. Lucile Watson welcomes you and is naturally excited to meet her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> The fly in this ointment are other guests of the house, a longtime friend of Davis Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband, who is also from Europe, a Romanian diplomat and aristocrat, George Coulouris. Coulouris is a spendthrift and wasteful, and smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas's antifascist background. <br /> <br /> Your suspicions are very correct, it is the reason why the family has been the vagabond they have become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since then. His family loyally supports him in any decision he makes. Those decisions affect all the other cast members. <br /> <br /> Adding a little more to Broadway's work, including some charming fascist creatures, was Dashiell Hammett, who was another important person of Lillian Hellman. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a creation of Hammett with such disgusting types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever seen. to the screen like the Runmanian account without an account. It was a metaphor for his own country that enthusiastically embraced the Nazis and then repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lucile Watson was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou. in For whom the bell tolls. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film was lost for Best Film before that other antifascist classic, Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Although it is an article firmly planted in those specific times, Watch On The Rhine still has a severe antifascist message that can be repeated infinitely.
