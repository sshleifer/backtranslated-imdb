['If you are in the mood to have fun ... and want to relax and enjoy ... bade Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started quite well ... but it is Govinda who steals the program from her hands ... an incredible moment and a good transmission of dialogues ... it is inspired by Bad boys ... but it has Indian Masala. ... people think it could be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan is directing and Govinda is acting ... should not raise any questions ... other films recommended in the same genre (David&#39;s combo) Dhavan / Govinda) ... are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi no. 1, hero n. Â° 1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.']
