Simple, meaningful and offers an emotional punch. I regularly move through boring short films and it is always nice to find something that has a simple and enlightened message, without pretensions or indulgent directives. <br /> <br /> A child at school has to attend a lesson when his friend plays absenteeism and receives the most important lesson of his life, only to discover that when there are not enough copies to share, he has to share them with the school bully. <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films with children or actors of these children hold their own and is credible. The soundtrack complements the emotion of the piece very well and the plot of the film works well.
