We saw this in my Women's Health Issues class to point out how women are treated less than men in many societies, and I loved this movie. I plan to try to get a copy of myself to see. The story is very moving and I would recommend it to anyone. I'm a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite their qualification. This is a movie that I will show my children. The teacher in our class thought that the film was mainly an education about women, but this movie was more than that. It is one of those movies that will always remain in my mind and will be my favorite.
