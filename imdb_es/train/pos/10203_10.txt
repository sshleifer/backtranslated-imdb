I love movies and I own comics, comics are different from those in the movie, but I would still give it to me: 10 out of 10. It was amazing. If the movies were more impressive. I would have your babies. And I am a woman. Read the comics you will not regret. Yes, in this film, since Brian P., the artist for her died, we do not have such a good artistic work. I mean, seriously, do not get me wrong, these people did very well, but different versions for different people. Different strokes for different people as the saying goes. Any guy who does not go crazy over her is crazy, or does not like women, or you know she just plans crazy. If I could count on my fingers I fell in love and how many times I read the comics I would have no fingers, but there are always toes.
