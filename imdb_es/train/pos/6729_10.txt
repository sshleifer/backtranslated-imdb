If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have any interest in seeing the real, non-cartoon side of the United States, then the Riding Giants will hit more deeply than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is "unreal", an easy term, if there ever was one, but very appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning, it is a documentary 100% factual, but with all the drama of an opera, and the sense of love completely apparent, expert and wise instilled by the direction and narration of Stacy Peralta, this film expertly guides you from wave to wave while keeping you captivated by all that you are given the privilege to see <br /> <br /> This film is a symphony, elaborated just like Beethovens 9th, which begins beautifully with its prelude in Hawaii, which deeply drags human emotion into Santa Cruz and ends with rampage, triumph and crescendo in feats of Laird Hamilton, again in Hawaii. br /> <br /> Like classical music; As Beethoven's Ninth, Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
