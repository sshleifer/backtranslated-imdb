Many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been tried. That may be so, but the addition of the narrator and the landscape as Dr.Suess make this show a must see. With hints for adults throughout the series and a touch of childhood throughout the whole, the show is both reminiscent and stimulating. The investigative part of the program is not what draws the spectators. The twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise are what make loyal viewers come back for more. This is a success that ABC should never leave out. Bravo abc. LOST was getting old, a way to revitalize prime time. 9 episodes before the writers' strike left the audience wanting more.
