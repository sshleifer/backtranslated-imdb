This movie is simply amazing. It was a very delicate subject and the movie was excellent. This movie did not generate any controversy in India (to my knowledge) and its publicity also remained low. Initially, I thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the directors and producers in India used to change the subject even though it is very sensitive and adds a love story in the original story and ruins the whole thing ... most viewers in India would agree on this subject if you remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC, etc. <br /> <br /> There have been so many films in India that would have become a milestone or mega successes if the part of the love story was not added unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> But its treatment is quite similar to the film Pinjar (must also see). <br /> <br /> If you count, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for making a great movie ...
