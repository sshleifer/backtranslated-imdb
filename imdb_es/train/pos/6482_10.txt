I had just arrived at thirteen when I first saw this series and I'm watching it again, on DVD, more than thirty years later. The photos about the opening credits have never left me. It has affected my vision of the world and the peoples in it. My parents were with me long enough to have watched the series with me, and we always talked about the program afterwards. I loved studying history and the highest marks I got on public exams at our school! <br /> <br /> The voice and the delivery of Sir Laurence Olivier are eternal and perfect. I have the feeling that the people who lived it would feel that this is their version of the history of World War II. I can not imagine never getting bored watching him. Perhaps now a similar series of the Cold War could be contemplated, although it is difficult to imagine who could replace Sir Laurence. <br /> <br /> Buy it!
