['This movie is great Simply. It is rare that you find a comedy with levels, and this is a good example of that. When I saw this movie for the first time, while the credit rolled up, a friend and I looked at each other and asked ... &quot;Did you just see that?&quot; For those who hesitate, look at the levels. See the comparisons between Vick and the people in the club, the DNA! See the various characters, each push per position, and if you do not see anything else, see the connection between Vick&#39;s cure and the path through the movie. EVERYTHING IS IN THE HEAD OF VICK! The opening line on the world of Vick. The final scene with the camera entering Vick&#39;s head and into a whole universe! Completely quotable, wonderful cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!']
