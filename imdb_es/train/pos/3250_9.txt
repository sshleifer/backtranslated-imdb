Another for the Babes & Bullets crowd. The story is much sharper than any other musical I've seen: the cannons hide the legs of the females and are located generatively in the other in a way that is closer to the intelligent comments than we might expect for the stage. More effective than the contemporary 'drama'. It is difficult to identify with a woman who keeps a cannon going up her pants, as a legacy. Quite remarkable if you consider the context. <br /> <br /> Although the barrel of the leg provides 90% of the surprises, this film also tells how greed cancels all other considerations in the life of a group of yakuzas that chase a woman who keeps his leg in a hidden cannon / rocket launcher (thus, there are no group rain scenes or thongs) The hidden projectile launcher that is pulled out from behind behind the protagonists, seemingly out of nowhere, in Dead or Alive (1999) ). ), The torch taken out of the air by the heroine towards the end of the original Tomie (2000), or the harrowing scene of the flamethrower in Sunny Gets Blue (1992), all testify of a Cantinflas-esquire almost of the third world. Influence on contemporary Japanese cinema, of which I can not explain, but I can not complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see good quality movies of this essence made in Hollywood, it is almost extinct and with cheap garbage that pumps for a cheap emotion, it is almost laughable. This is a true movie and, although it is great in its entirety, the ending is a brilliant, if not despicable, scam of certain images of Sergio Le√≥n, involving cannons where the legs should be, and it is certainly appropriate!
