I watched The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse's Drive Class In Cult Classics (with Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie contains a lot of history in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, cyclists, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> The main actors do a credible job. And, I found that the intricately woven plot was believable and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the distribution of support, mainly motorcyclists, offers limited performance, especially when asked to deliver lines with more than a few words. . Maybe they used real cyclists, instead of actors. A couple of characters, in particular, were exceptionally credible. <br /> <br /> The musical score is absolutely right, for the times, the tempo and to advance the story. I found music a real pleasure. I noticed in the opening credits that the film presented the music of "The Food", I searched for them on Google; but, he could not find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey, who wrote, produced and starred in this film, liked the idea (of a capricious married man brought to the redemption through trials and tribulations and, a little help, of course) that he wrote, produced and starred in "Weekend with the Nanny."
