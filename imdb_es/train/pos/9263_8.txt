This is a totally charming and unexpected movie. Start by following a young person who hopes to participate in the qualifying football game between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the young person is a girl and girls (or women) are not allowed to go to football matches to "sit with men". What follows is a wonderful comedy, played with consummate skill by a small ensemble. The film explores the absurdity of the restrictions on women's freedom (and, in fact, the young soldiers who have to corral them). There are some excellent pieces, not only when one of the girls has to go to the bathroom and, of course, the stadium does not have toilets for women. The camera work is very simple and, in some way, this story could have been told as a play. However, it is the small scale that gives a special touch to the film. Great cinema? No, probably not; Great entertainment - sure.
