['The first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and configured as an amateur camcorder tape, with a digital timer in the lower part of the picture. It presents a woman kidnapped by a gang of men dressed in black who torture her for several days before finally killing her. The hapless victim is savagely beaten and thrown with raw meat before his nails are removed with pliers, his hand is crushed with a hammer, his eye pierced with a needle, etc. <br /><br /> In the most nauseating scene, the woman&#39;s captors burn her with hot water and shed live worms at burns. The series received much publicity when the American actor Charlie Sheen, believing that the series contained a real murder, tried to prohibit its distribution in the United States. An FBI investigation revealed that the films were just what they seemed to be for most viewers: sick re-creations with unpleasant but obvious special effects. Gruesomely starring acclaimed comic book artist Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this movie is a sure way to clear all rooms except the most tolerant. But, the gorehounds probably will not find anything special.']
