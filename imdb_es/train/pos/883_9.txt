I settled down to see "Read My Lips", a dish of Freedom Fries in front of me. The food was quickly forgotten when the director and co-author Jacques Audiard threw us a novel of suspense and suspense. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is the secretary of a company that develops large construction projects. In fact, she has some important responsibilities that usually do not fall on the secretaries and she is capable and ambitious. And frustrated by a male hierarchy that will exploit it but will not reward it. <br /> <br /> Work builds up faster than she can handle, they tell Carla to hire a secretary. Enter the ex-convict and general friend of Paul (Vincent Cassel). He lies about his abilities and, in fact, does not have any that a legitimate company may require. After a serious initial misunderstanding of Paul regarding Carla's interest in him, the two become allies. A peculiar friendship begins. In a trick that would have turned a real Carla into a great contender in "The Apprentice," she triumphs over her selfish male adversary at work with Paul's connivance. Get out of the rival. <br /> <br /> Carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid. With that she hears almost normally. Turn off the hearing aid to isolate yourself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. She is also very lonely. She made a heroic makeup effort to make it look simple, but she is really beautiful. She does not have a boyfriend. She takes care of children so that a friend can have a link (it's a French movie). Worse and humiliating, she agrees to a girlfriend's request to hang out somewhere while the married friend has it with her lover in Carla's bed. Not well. <br /> <br /> As Carla and Paul get to know each other better, the scarcely repressed larceny side of the not-so-former criminal emerges. By the way, there is a parallel story of Paul's relationship with his parole officer that perfectly complements the main plot and has its own ending of great surprise. <br /> <br /> "Read My Lips?" The ingenious Paul recognizes that Carla's ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the fun saloon trick she seems to be. <br /> <br /> A caper is developed from there. I already said <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a truly strange criminal couple. She wants love but will also accept money. He loves her, more or less, but business must come before a possible erotic satiety. Together, Cassel and Devos are strong actors who carry an unusual crime story to the end in a very convincing manner. <br /> <br /> Rent it or buy it, but if you enjoy a good crime story, look for "Read My Lips". And you may want to see it several times: I do. <br /> <br /> 9/10
