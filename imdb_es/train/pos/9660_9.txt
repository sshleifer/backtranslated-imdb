Only after a reflection did I decide that I liked this movie. And after reading the comments of all the other posters here, and thinking more about it, I decided that I liked it enormously. I love American movies, probably because they are very narrative. In general, they have a well-defined beginning, middle and end. "Presque rien", on the other hand, does not make such an attempt. I do not agree with other posters that say it is "too artistic". In every way, this film aims to evoke your sensory memories. Very often during the film you feel that you are there ... you feel the summer sun, the breeze, the heat, the winter cold, the company, the solitude, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> In every way, the director takes you to the life of the characters, which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them. After I finished seeing it, I felt the same. But after reflecting, I recognized that this was how the film had to be: the "story" is not the narrative, it is the emotions that you (the viewer) feel. <br /> <br /> The lighting, the landscape, and the angles of the camera immerse you in the scenes: they are rich, exquisite and full of details and nuances. Although normally I can not tolerate movies without a fully developed plot (after all, it is not a "supposed" movie to tell a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
