McConaughey in a horror thriller? I had to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot is told in flashback mode, and it is a family of three people, otherwise normal and happy, who goes through a very strange situation. I can not say much more without ruining the whole movie, I'm sorry. You just have to know that if you decide to see it, you will be surprised, at least. <br /> <br /> All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job directing those kids, and his acting is amazing. McConaughey's performance is solid at all times and fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges you to think. Dad is crazy? Is there a god? Are there demons? How far would you go to correct an error? And what is "correct" anyway? I'm still thinking. <br /> <br /> And therefore I recommend "Fragility". 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second or even the third viewing.
