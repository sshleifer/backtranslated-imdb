In general, a good film and better due to the fact that if the film had not been made, the story could remain hidden from the masses. Brosnan does a good job as the Native American with a hidden past and photography is impressive. For some, this may be too capricious, for others boring, for me it is a soft story, well told and perfect for the eyes of the family. Now that's not something that you get much recently.
