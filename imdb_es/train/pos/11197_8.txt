Another silent film of a love triangle by Hitchcock is not a mystery, but it is very English, very well developed and photographed. The soft boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits circus boxer "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his training partner, in part to keep the beautiful but fickle Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. There are many characters of character and grotesque at the wedding of Jack and Mabel, the verger, standing in the aisle of the church, recorded shock to see the men very tall and very low, the fat woman, the twins together that, of course , discuss which side of the aisle to sit on, and the wedding banquet is fun. The rest of the movie has Jack losing Mabel and boxing his way back to his heart, or something like that. It was another era in total, with the audience dressed at night and the boxers also disguised when they left the ring. The angles of the camera, the rhythm, the use of symbols, the cut, all very elegant and masterful. The camera work and the edition of the last boxing match is very exciting. The good appearance of Brisson is very used in this case; his smile is not as alien to what happens around him as it is in Hitchcock's The Manxman, so it's not annoying. But can boxers have such dimples?
