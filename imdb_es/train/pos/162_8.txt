For a "no budget" movie this is great. I do not know if the United States is going to like it, but we were laughing all the time. Some really fun things. Not really Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The actors and the music were shaken. The cars and gags and even less in your face made us explode. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I've seen some of the actors before, but never in something like this, one or two of them, I think I've seen them in commercials or something somewhere. Basically it rocked! Luckily I could see a copy of a friend of one of the actors.
