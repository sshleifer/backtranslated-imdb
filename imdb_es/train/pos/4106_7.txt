This is definitely NOT the intellectual film with a deep mission, so I really do not think there's much I do not understand so you're not Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. The humor is simple, quite funny and, sometimes, perhaps, not very morbid. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), for what the authors are. But it does not matter, the genre is really different and these two films should not be compared in this way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to teach you a lesson, he will try to make you laugh and there is a chance that he will succeed. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, it's not the ingenious one, but I enjoyed it. Some scenes are really worth seeing.
