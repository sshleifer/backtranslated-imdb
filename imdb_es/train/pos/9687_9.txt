A talking parrot is not a very imaginative idea for a new movie, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant and moving film that will delight the whole family. He manages to close the gap between sentimental trash and cruel cruelty during the separation of Marie and Paulie, and all the events in the film lead to an extremely satisfying emotional conclusion. The training with animals is well done: everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and should have been much more successful, although this movie was not a highlight of 1998, unlike Saving Private Ryan. This hour and a half will surely be pleasant and one that you will remember. Paulie's story is moving, sad, happy and interesting. From the moment he is first seen until the moment he joins his original owner, he will enjoy following him and watching him learn about friendship and the grim realities of life throughout the world. path. Do not miss out if you have some kind of heart or emotion. 9/10
