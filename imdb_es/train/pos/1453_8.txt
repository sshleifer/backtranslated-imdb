Well, there are many ways to spoil a political thriller. Usually, they are derivatives or too ambitious, often they present a conspiracy that is totally paranoid and incredible. But the City Council does not do anything of the aforementioned. The plot is skillfully crafted, the story is believable. As for the characters, I would say that this movie is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrayal of a charismatic mayor of New York is excellent and proves once again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors today.
