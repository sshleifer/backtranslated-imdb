Xizao is a rare little movie. It is simple and undemanding, and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy. The story is simple, and the theme of the old and new clashes is beautifully introduced in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the film, but it would not have been like that if it were not for the magnificent characters and the actors that represent them. <br /> <br /> The elderly patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of China. Days before the expansion. He runs a bathhouse in an old neighborhood. Each scene set in the bathhouse is a source of jelaousy for us, stressed and unhappy people. Not even hardened cynics can find fault with this wonderful scenario. <br /> <br /> Er Ming, the mentally disabled son of Master Liu, is the second truly powerful character in the film, along with his modern-day brother. The interactions between these three people and the various visitors of the bathhouse are incredibly detailed and sincere, with some scenes that accumulate so much emotion that it is beyond almost everything that is seen in the movies. <br /> <br /> With his regime In a critical message, this film was not only censored, but also received unreasonable coverage. It could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliber is practically impossible to find, even on the Internet (!), You can not help but suspect. <br /> <br /> So help freedom of expression and the movie. World, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you own the DVD, if there is one, share and share!
