I found this movie hilarious. The parodies in other popular movies of that time were some of the most fun I've seen in this type of movie. Give it a try. If you saw the movies that this movie is faking and you have humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and the others who watched the movie with me) felt the funniest part of the movie. (This is not a spoiler because I will NOT tell you what really happens) It was a scene with the "striking thing" of MIB. When they discover the device for the first time and do not know what it does ... and then later in the film ... it will understand when it gets there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film is that I have never been able to find it on DVD in order to buy a copy.
