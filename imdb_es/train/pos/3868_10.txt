A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it may not be for everyone. <br /> <br /> The camera works, acts, directs and everything else is unique, original, excellent in every way, and very different from the garbage that we are sadly accustomed to obtain. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, believable and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this film, his performance is unique, it is completely his, neither "British" nor "American" nor anything else he has ever seen. There is something fascinating about it. <br /> <br /> The natural, long and uninterrupted shots are wonderful, and remind us that we have become too accustomed to some restricted ways of filming and editing.
