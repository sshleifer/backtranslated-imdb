This video shook! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. Not only does it have class, but it makes some of the funniest observations about the history and culture that I have seen. Eddie is the most original and intelligent comic I've seen in a long time. Tell all those other stand-ups to leave the stage and let this "executive" reign!
