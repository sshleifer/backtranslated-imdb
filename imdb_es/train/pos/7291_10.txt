When you normally watch a short film, you are always afraid that the person who creates the film will try to pay too much attention to it. That is not the case with this. A great story about a young woman who has had enough and other mundane forces who try to help make things right. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps convey the complexities of the blurred line of right and wrong. <br /> <br /> Both the girl and the father give excellent performances in this wonderful short film, but Eric's performance is definitely the show thief in this story. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie for its complexity, performance and excellent throughout the story.
