In general, this film was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many future generations. Although the plot is not 100% accurate for the book, almost everything is correct. The movie jumps very far and some important parts are lost. I found the book and it was ready and I immediately wished they had made a movie (because I still had not heard about the film), but then I found it in a wastebasket at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what I had expected. In general, I give these films a 7 out of 10 for their good parts (relative precision and general sense) and for their bad parts (big time jumps and small but noticeable inaccuracies).
