Around 1986 I saw a movie by accident on TV one night. I was 6 years old. It was similar to my accidental viewing of the final scary of Do not look now in 1987. I went to Venice on vacation the following year with a silent terror, waiting for God that my parents would not find out that I had seen it. <br /> <br /> Would it have mattered if my parents knew that I had seen Les Valseuses when I was a child? I would probably avoid the subject with my dad even today, and my mom probably disapproves of life after death. I do not know if they would want to see it anyway. From the stalking and trapping of a woman in the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with satiated and glassy eyes, I'm never sure if this movie is a piece of insensitive garbage that ignores the sexual revolution or if It's a sexy and liberating movie to watch when you realize that you could never be so offensive. <br /> <br /> It's definitely violent. He has a violent vision of sex, practically without recognition of love. Even breastfeeding a small baby mutates into a sexual act of greedy exploitation. But the stage is very erotic and (so I'm so British) waking up! Do they suck their breasts for their own good? That is exploitation. So, why am I getting wood? <br /> <br /> The companions go in search of an older woman with experience, do they find an ex-convict, a maternal figure? I do not know. It ends in a truly frightening suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has the bowels of the cannibal Holocaust, and left eeuurrgghh! There is no motherly love for this film, quite the opposite. Mutilation of where the kids started. Why do they shoot the girl in the leg? Why does she come back to them? Should we punish women so that they learn what is right of men? <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of two films, one of which I wish I had never seen, the other makes me wish it were not like that. It is not such a hard world. Sweep Away / Madonna: what a pile of madness does not compute has never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes a slave of a man and it is possible that Madonna says that everyone respects Ritchie, I am so enraged that I can use the score. Once upon a time in America / God of Leona, why do the noodles do it? Destroy the path of joy that we have been following throughout his life. So close to finally finding love with Deborah. Now both are destroyed. Why sergio Why? <br /> <br /> There is no rape in Les Valseuses, but a lot of sex and nudity in abundance, of both sexes. Very honest, without excitement. No fancy hairs, no perfect Hollywood moves. Jokes, yes. But there is too much darkness, jealousy and cheating here to call it a sexual comedy. Forget about continuing to shoot a naked hairdresser in the leg because she will come back and you will connect her with the revenge son of your former swindler and she will learn how to get rid of him. <br /> <br /> Two things I can not stand are the rape movies and the prison movies. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God will not want to see it now! It's a brilliant movie!
