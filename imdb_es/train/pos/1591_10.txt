My mother and I have recently become addicted to this show, laughing at everything! I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I'm disappointed that I did not pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled. The line of the story is very funny, the characters really have great personalities (or, not so much, but they are still fun!). I TOLD every episode of what I like about you. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as the entire cast, never leave me bored while watching. There is inappropriate language for children and some sexual content, but with a guide for parents nearby, it should not have too many problems. There is some kind of relationship type of "Friends" that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.
