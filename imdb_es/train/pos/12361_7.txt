Bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political film, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but that seems more metaphorical than reality. Well, almost everything in the movie seems metaphorical. The revolutionaries, of whom we see and of whom we learn very little, may well be mafiosi. Out the old and the new. <br /> <br /> Andrea's father, a psychoanalyst, seems to defend the traditional bourgeois values ​​of always: morally straight, undisturbed, clean and orderly, completely ritualized. <Br /> <br /> Giullia, the girlfriend of a revolutionary, seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs a great cause for their support, but is unable to muster the kind of devotion that such a commitment demands. (I'm guessing here). Andrea, the teenager, seems to be the only boy in the movie who is not in some way restless "upatz". He is respectful of his father but also disobedient. He loves Giullia, or so we suppose, although he is not old enough to have learned to handle his reflexes optimally, but he leaves her to show up at school and complete his final exams. Their course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as "means". He is the man who is in the middle, who knows the meaning of gradualism, who can remain calm while those around him are screaming. <br /> <br /> Most of this is summarized during the oral part of your final exams when you are asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from "Antigone", which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularism and free will. <br /> <br /> That brings us, of course, not aware of - to Marushka Detmars. It reminds me of a New York cartoon from a few years ago. Two hippos are at the height of the neck, looking at a gazelle that drinks from the shore, and a hippopotamus tells the other: "I hate it." She is a good actress. (Let me get it out of the way). But so is the rest of the movie. She carries with her, in her speech and manner, the rich shine of absolute madness. And everything comes from the actress too, not from the director's help. Detmars is not crazy as Catherine DeNeuve was crazy in "Repulsion". The walls do not turn rubber and the hands grow. Instead, we see her animated, sometimes ALSO animated. And it gives us shocking shocks when your mood changes abruptly and becomes a threat to a looming storm threat. <br /> <br /> A critic described her as sensual, but that probably is not the word she was looking for. She is incredibly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair, her wide white smile, her impulsive giggles. And his eyes are like eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. The attractive parts are quite erotic, not so much because one of them is explicit, but because we have come to know the characters involved. (It's more interesting to spy on the couple on the next honeymoon than to go to a movie for the skin). Actually there is not SO much sex. There is only one scene of simulated sex, but the director lets her act in what seems to be real time. At least in real time for a child of eighteen. <br /> <br /> The young man who plays Andrea is also fine, which is necessary, because the film depends almost entirely on him and Giullia. They have to take it and they do it. If it were not for his performances, I'm not sure this is as interesting or admirable a movie as it is. It could easily have become a rather slow and boring romance. <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
