['All the people who sit here and say that the weak link in this movie is that the Ramones would probably say that Amadeus was fine if it were not for that irritating harpsichord. Rock and Roll High School was centered around the Ramones. How someone can see this and not get a kick from Joey Ramone eating bean sprouts behind the scenes in an attempt to keep it in condition is obviously a damp square daddy blanket. Mrs. Trogar, the white mice that explode, the patrols of the room ... instant classics. It does not matter the character of Riff Randell. <br /><br /> If you do not like Ramones, then you do not know rock and roll and you do not deserve to see a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.']
