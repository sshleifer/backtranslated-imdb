Emma is a horribly flawed film based on the classic novel by Jane Austens. I have not read the book, so I really did not know much about the plot, and still predicts almost the entire plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me due to bad writing or direction. Although the movie is for some reason very entertaining and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes that I did not like, but most of them were well acted and fun. Gwyneth Paltrow offers one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The film is also starring Toni Collette (Who is doing well, but it has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger (Who has also been better, but still very good here) Alan Cumming (With whom I have never been really impressed and is almost the same here)) and Jeremy Northam (the interpretation of Who is more of wood at first glance, but in reality it is quite subtle, even if it was not what I needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen's books, but it still being very entertaining and worth seeing.
