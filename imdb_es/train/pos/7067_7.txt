Although little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a pretty teenager with a cheerful personality and a highly admired operatic singing voice. This was his first major film in 1937, and it turned out to be a box office bonanza for the beleaguered Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> THREE SMART GIRLS refers to three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their invisible father for a long time. The faithful mother reveals that she will soon remarry, with the firm intention of undermining her gold-seeking girlfriend and returning him to her mother. Although the story is slight, the script is ingenious and the expert cast interprets it with a touch of skill. Durbin has a pleasant voice and an attractive personality, and such nice actors as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer complete the cast. An ultra-light fun for movie fans of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
