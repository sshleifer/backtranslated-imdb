This is a great movie! It does not matter the low rating here. I really have no idea where that came from, they must be discussing a different movie at that time. Because I loved it and it seemed like a little hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> His story was so original and charming. I really can not think of anything bad to say about that. Maybe it has to be "your kind of thing", but, I saw this with my sister and my mother, and we all get carried away by this. <br /> <br /> The performance was also very good, and that's hard to do in a movie like this. But I found all the characters very intriguing and friendly. <br /> <br /> I have always liked Dougray Scott a lot and I found his new "dark" role very interesting. It's really hard to get me to like a bad guy, but this time I did not have any problems with that. Moreover, he adored him. <br /> <br /> Everyone who loves a good thriller / drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should go see this movie, there's no doubt about it! However, anyone who wants to watch a movie with 80% bloodshed, should rent something else ... But I guess the title already says it. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars! Good job! <br /> <br /> xxx Enjoy!
