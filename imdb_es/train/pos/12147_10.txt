Return to The 3th Chamber is the comic sequel to the epic 36th Chamber Of Shaolin, in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became a monk and an incredible fighter. In this sequel, Liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after hitting his friends. Imitate the original Shan Te, try all kinds of tricks to get to the Shaolin Temple to learn and finally get some unique skills to fight against some bosses of harassment. It is a classic tale of martial arts, with the best production values ​​of the Shaw Brothers and the safe direction of Lui Chia Liang. The choreography is fantastic in everything, either for the comedy of fight or slapstick and the performance of Gordon Liu, as are the others, particularly the nice monk works perfectly for the material. The film is less epic or profound than some of the stars of other works and there are certainly more great, more violent and overwhelming Shaw Brothers films. But few have such a magical combination of slapstick, unique training and fighting, with a subtle but warm story of a useless guy doing well. Filled with cheerful joy, it is impossible not to give this one the highest score.
