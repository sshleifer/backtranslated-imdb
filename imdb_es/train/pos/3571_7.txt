I've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love her. This should be a favorite cult! The best line, "Your dress is very cool!" says the prince to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like the stepmother. I also like the cars and motorcycles of the fifties. The melancholic prince is a great departure from the typical braggart. Try to stay calm, but can not hide his love for the princess of the future. His shoe is not glass (more true to the original story), but Cinderella loses, however, but he recovers the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it does not show anymore and seems almost impossible to get. Hopefully Blockbuster or Amazon begin to store this soon.
