George Lopez is a funny man even without comedy. The first episodes I saw of this often made jokes at the expense of his mother. As I have seen this more, there has been more and more variety. No one in the cast is really safe from their wits now. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that as this season has progressed, George is becoming more comfortable with the role of dad in the family comedy. At first it was not, but it is getting more and more into a furrow. This makes both him and the shows more and more fun. They had added a couple of characters for George to play out this year as well. The father of his wife is getting more and more involved in the plot. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but it is not as important as the previous seasons. I think it's prudent to say that, given George's comic book feel, and the lack of good ABC comedies, George Lopez has a good chance of being here on ABC long after George W. Bush.
