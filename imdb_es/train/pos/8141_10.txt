I picked up the film uncovered and did not even know what it was, but when I saw it I laughed so much. Now it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the boys created a masterpiece. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor. Thanks Rusty for giving us something to laugh about.
