'Gray Gardens' (1975) is the strange documentary of the Maysles brothers of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy, the aunt and cousin of Onassis who live like pigs in a 28-room mansion in East Hampton, Long Island. 'Big Edie' Bouvier Beale, 78, witty and dry and her daughter, 'Little Edie' Beale, 56, (emotionally as 13) a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future, lives isolated from the rest of the world except for its many cats and raccoons in the attic. They have fun arguing all day, listening to the radio or singing to each other (they do not even own a television). It is amazing to learn about his fall from society and the viewer is attracted to these two very special people, although obviously dysfunctional. One of the best documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today.
