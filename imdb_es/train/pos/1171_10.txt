['I found this episode to be one of the funniest I&#39;ve seen in a long time. The creators of South Park have made the best parody of a Romero movie I&#39;ve seen. They have truly touched upon the underlying social commentary of Romero that he has made with each of his films. I would love to know what George Romero said about this episode, I&#39;m sure he was totally positive. Keeping your true vision of your zombie epics intact! Most of the parodies deal with the pure blood without making the viewer think like Romero tries to do with his films. I think if there was a zombie outbreak, we could worry about our property values before our lives as shown in this episode!']
