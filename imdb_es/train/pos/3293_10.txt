If I was ever asked to remember a song from an old movie, then it would have to be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" for its meaning, the way it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, the lyrics of Kaif Bhopali and not to mention film photography when the sailboat comes out against the black background and the bright stars. The other would have to be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was Meena Kumari's last film before she died and the amount of time she took can be seen on the screen. In each of the songs that are represented, he looks young but after that he does not. But an actor who did not change his appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her and especially his feet, after accidentally entering the cabin of his train and seeing them, leaves a note describing how beautiful they are. . <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if possible, should be seen on the big screen just for the sake of film photography and songs. The film stars Meena Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi's grandson has now begun to relive his grandfather's studio by making a comedy film.
