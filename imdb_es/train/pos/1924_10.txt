This show was great, it was not just for the children, what I thought at first, is for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was mainly about the fact that the father takes care of two daughters and his son, he unfortunately died in season 2, I could believe it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I'm dressed that they continued with the show, since that's what would really happen in real life and I need to mention The Goodbye Episode It was so well done, it must be so hard for them to film this, they I could tell they were real tears in his eyes. I am a 24 year old man and this episode made me cry because I know how they felt when my father died when I was also 13 years old, just like Roy. <br /> <br /> Season 2 and season 3 had a great comedy there also season 3 had some of my favorites, like Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still believe that the program was strong enough to continue, I was disappointed that it ended, it was one of the best, no. It was the best family comedy show since Home Improvement and it could have been next. <br /> <br /> I should never have finished, but I still love watching reruns every day.
