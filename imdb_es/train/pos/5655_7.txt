I watched this program because they told me that I remembered David Pench's Twin Peaks, a program I adore. The program quickly begins to introduce us to the main characters and, quite unusual, the pilot episode is for me the best of all, it is extremely dramatic and really brings out the bad side of the program, ready to progress during the rest of the season. My only most important criticism is that I felt a little disappointed by the program, probably not by its own fault, since it was canceled after only 1 season, it seemed to show a lot of potential and deserved a much better treatment than it received. The performance is excellent, and this show has some of the best characters (good and bad) that I have seen that are well developed in a short space of time. There is a strange cheese effect for the first 5 or 10 shows that are a bit too dramatic, but this is rectified as the season progresses. Well worth a watch, definitely something out of the ordinary!
