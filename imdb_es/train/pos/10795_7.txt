In general, the movie was pretty good, a good action plot with a lot of explosions and fight scenes, but Chuck Norris almost did nothing, except disarm the bomb and shoot some characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11, with a bin Carden terrorist sending a video to the president (Urich) and threatening to detonate him. Judson Mills had some great action roles, eliminating the Rashid compound and several butt kick roles, but Chuck Norris was missing. Judson took over most of the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) with Que on his computer. But, in general, he was realistic and did not lack action, but he only did it on behalf of Mr. Norris. I gave him the movie 7/10.
