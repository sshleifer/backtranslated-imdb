Like most of you might see Star Wars: Return the Jedi you can meet It's a good movie, but as you may have seen in the video It's possible that they have a party at the end and that they probably finish the movie with the party with no spirits or nothing But in the original (live TV) When they are partying But before I say more when Ben Obi-wan dies in the Imperial Ship or the Death Star, they saw him disappear and Yoda dies from old age or illness internal But because Luke killed Darth Vader (Real name: Anakin Skywalker) when everyone is partying at the end, when Luke or someone stops the spirits, Ben and Yoda stand before him and smile while another spirit appears. He is his Darth Vader but not as a Sith As The Old Usual Selve Off and he began to smile with Ben and Yoda. I think that made the end of the movie a bit interesting. But the producers or anyone should make a spirit of Padme And Mace Windu and other Jedi who were killed with Younglings Under There are weapons in the back ground
