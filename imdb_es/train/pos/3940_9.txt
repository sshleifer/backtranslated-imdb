['This film was not only a personal favorite of John Ford, but also the directors numbered Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his high profile admirers. Ironically, I just caught up with him through the recent Criterion 2-Disc Play, after missing a couple of tests of his original language on Italian television many years ago and again several times on television, while I&#39;m in Hollywood! <br /><br /> The film marked the first of Ford&#39;s nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also a quintessential example of Ford&#39;s American streak. A work beautifully elaborated and pictorially quite poetic, the sequences of the court (and the eventual revelation) in its second half are still quite complicated, in addition to giving the unconditional character actor Donald Meek a memorable role as the prosecutor. <br /><br /> Fonda is, of course, perfectly regarded as a lawyer, inexperienced but rigorous and a humanist lawyer who was destined to become president; Fonda would represent other fictional politicians in the film, especially in THE BEST MAN (1964), by Franklin J. Schaffner, and FAIL-SAFE (1964), by Sidney Lumet, and it is surprising now to know that at that time he was reluctant to accept Lincoln&#39;s role since, in his opinion, it was &quot;like playing God&quot;! <br /><br /> It is interesting to note here that Ford had previously approached Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), an excellent but perhaps little-known gem that, fortunately, has just been released as a DVD of Special Edition by the United Kingdom . The true criterion of stand-in, the &quot;Masters Of Cinema&quot; label of Eureka. In addition, I also have two other Abraham Lincoln movies in my DVD collection that I have not yet seen and, by the way, both were directed by DW Griffith - THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and they had No I only received a lot of movies that I had never seen before, I would have gladly given them a turn based on my highly satisfactory viewing experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.']
