GBS wrote its own adaptation for the screen of this Nobel Prize winning work, but did not live to see it produced (it won an Oscar in 1938 for its brilliant adaptation of its PYGMALION 1914 work). When Otto Preminger mounted (produced and directed) this production in 1957, seven years after the death of Shaw, he noticed that the British author Graham Greene made the adaptation and it was a solid choice. <br /> <br /> Following the example of Shaw's In his own script, Greene uses the material of the stage Epilogue to create a framing device to merge the two acts of the play (one at the beginning and one at the end of the story). de Joan) in a unified and more satisfactory whole. Where on stage the change of tone is muffled with an intermission, here it works just as well with a return to KING's bedroom Charles Balois (where the man Joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events that led to his current situation) , and more material from Shaw's Epilogue: the introduction of the shadow of Warwick by John Gielgud (the English "creator of kings"). <br /> <br /> The majority of the language is solid GBS, and the performances of the unconditional Shauvians (like Felix The Inquisitor of Aymler or Harry Andrews' of Stogumber) to relative newcomers (the film established Jean's career Seberg) are top notch. It is possible that some, only familiar with the many villains of Richard Widmark, see him play a fragile and a little silly Dauphin, but the performance, curiously superior, is professional, although it could be said that it is a mistake. <br /> <br /> The symbolism of the opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of the black-and-white footage serve Shaw and the story. Come in expecting quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
