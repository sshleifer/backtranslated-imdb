This was an excellent 2 part episode, although I had never seen the older ones, I never thought that the doctor would face anything that was paranormal, of course, extra terrestrial but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> This episode brings the things we fear most and how humans, in a futuristic time, would fight and defeat the evil of real life when most of the odds say it would be impossible. <br /> <br /> Being that it is a family movie, I am surprised that they have brought some things such as fear and faith, especially if it is also going to entertain American audiences. But who cares what the Yankees say, we rock! Doctor Who has shown his potential since the first episode of the new series in 2005, being first harmless and frightening, from fun to serious, from light to dark. I hope many old fans will soon say "The old Doctor Who has returned". <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
