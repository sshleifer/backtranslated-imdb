I loved this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying Helen Graham, a beautiful young girl who was hiding, along with her young son, from a mysterious past. As an anglophile who loves romances ... this movie was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours in nineteenth century England. I must also mention that Toby Stephens, who plays the very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is reason enough to see this wonderful production.
