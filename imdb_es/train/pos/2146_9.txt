['I just saw this lovely Japanese feature film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival at the historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. <br /><br /> Although this film, subtitled in English, has ballroom dancing as its heart, it actually shows the world outside of Japan how rigid family structures, employment (wage-earning) and recreation in modern Japan still exist. <br /><br /> The writer / director Suo Masauki [I follow the Japanese custom of presenting the family name (surname) first and the first name (surname)] uses the not-so-popular theme of ballroom dances to show the social structure of Japan. <br /><br /> [Also, I will not use the names of the characters in the movies when the readers of the world are not familiar with the Japanese formal names that they can confuse. I will refer to the <br /><br /> actors by their professional actor name as it appears on the Internet Data Movie Base.] <br /><br /> Recruits the help of his wife in real life, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in his first and, for now, only film. She is a dance teacher in her father&#39;s dance studio. However, his true ambition is to compete once again in an International Dance Competition that was disqualified in the past. No, I will not say &quot;why&quot;. Watch the movie <br /><br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. A veteran of around 25 films since 1979, he offers an excellent interpretation of something like a company man from the 1940s. <br /><br /> who has a lovely wife, teenage daughter, and just bought the house from her <br /><br /> nostalgia. <br /><br /> And yet, something is missing from his own inner happiness. Watch this movie to find out how he gets involved with ballroom dancing and secretly going to <br /><br /> lessons Most of the dancing characters are liberated from the traditional. <br /><br /> Japanese hierarchy of the social structure. They are friendly, warm and welcoming. Of course, this contrasts sharply with the structure of Japanese society with its philosophy of &quot;place for all and for all in its place&quot;. <br /><br /> The movie has so many fun moments. The almost 1,500 theatergoers broke up. <br /><br /> In spontaneous laughter during many of the comic moments. This proves <br /><br /> That comedy does not have a foreign language. <br /><br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is fun and bright just like Watanabe Eriko. They are two actors of funny characters. <br /><br /> One could buy and read a college textbook about the structure of life in Japan, or, you could watch this good movie and begin to understand how it works. <br /><br /> The people of Japan grow up in a rather rigid social structure. Watching the movie &quot;Are we going Dansu?&quot; It is a quick immersion in a deeper study and see others <br /><br /> Japanese movies <br /><br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It is funny, charming, it will make you cry a little and it will warm your heart. <br /><br />']
