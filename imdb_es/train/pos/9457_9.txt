How can you summarize exactly how you feel and how does this movie feel good and correct? For several weeks, this DVD jumped off the shelf every time I went to the store, having seen Steve Carrell in a couple of movies before, I did not want to defame my thinking process of him, so I resisted and resisted, until I finally grabbed him with a 'What the hell!' attitude! And how surprised I was! I only wish I had bought it before. After having seen him three times in two days, I still smile at the portrait of a widower who struggles with his three daughters, longing for what is missing from the death of his beloved wife, who meets an intriguing woman, enchanting her in such a way. A deep and interesting way (dare I say bookish?), Sheds a completely different light to life that makes her realize what she was looking for. <br /> <br /> The drawback that this woman is her brother's sister complicates matters - that they portray Dan comically shy and with deep displeasure, seeing his "someone special" bringing so much fun and enjoyment to the family as to the life of his brothers. You just start to feel for him. <br /> <br /> Then, when the blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper, that is the turning point in Dan's estimate of Marie! The look she gives him when he repeats his comment, about not liking Ruthie, the green-eyed monster! Unleashing an absolutely hilarious scene while the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most elaborate, since Dan begins to relax with respect to Marie. <br /> <br /> Other heartbreaking scenes: Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, confronted by his brothers, begins to describe what has just happened ... when Dan's face falls, he breathes deeply! <br /> <br /> His youngest daughter, Lilly, who makes the present to celebrate his love for Suzanne, his late wife, brings a bit of sincere warmth and a little gulp when Dan realizes what he has lost in the life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays the guitar and sings in the Talent Show ... his voice cracks a bit as he repeats the song. ... absolute gem! <br /> <br /> The acceptance of what happens at the end of the film by their daughters ... all three love their father and want to see him happy, they will not allow him to deny his love for Marie; Dan's desperation for not failing his daughters because he is his rock, his strength ... and tell him much more than that with a few words. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I'll leave it for now, maybe come back and add more comments here in the near future ... but I'll end up saying ... <br /> <br /> .. .. if you want to see a movie that's just very good, with comedy turns to lighten the drama, you never feel forced or rude, it presents itself as a genuine portrait of a man discovering a new life, not just with a woman But also with your extended family, then look no further. <br /> <br /> DAN IN REAL LIFE: 9 out of 10 for a cinematographic experience so well represented with a score by Sondre Lerche, which takes you intimately there without being intrusive, with a fine. Performance of the cast. I can not wait to see this again !!
