Let me start by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 o'clock P.M. One night, I could not sleep until around 3:00 a.m. <br /> <br /> This brief review may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say that this is the best episode I've seen. I'm not saying that everyone should feel this way, but I do. This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family, taking care of my own father, comatose in the ICU before it happened. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: it is a seller who is The identity has been confused with that of a man named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> When ten minutes had passed, I knew that Tony was dreaming or that he was watching some other show. It was not like the normal Sopranos and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks at the sky in a "helicopter spotlight" and we see through it, a doctor with a flashlight. We see this only for a moment and the sequence develops until we return to real life in a situation similar to the one I just said. <br /> <br /> Tony has come out of the coma just for a moment. Your boys take A.J. The home and Carmella, overcome by stress, break in the hallway: a characteristic moment in the episode. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode, we parted with the real world: the family that deals with the potential negative outcome of this comma, and the alternative reality of Tony, which is parallel to what is happening both in his mind and in the real world that surrounds him. <br /> <br /> Then comes the star point in the episode: after AJ finishes telling her mother that he is not in school, she enters to see Meadow sitting next to Anthony. <br /> <br /> He approaches Tony and says the best line of the episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In Tony's world, he enters a dark room of the hotel and lights a light. He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. Try to mark, but can not, as if trying to say something to Carmella, but could not do it physically. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits and looks out the window. A bright light that has reoccurred throughout the episode now seems to call it from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold I'd like to die", from Moby, marries perfectly with these latest images. and it helps create an emotional roller coaster of an episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: Watch the next episode. Find out what light is. It is wonderful.
