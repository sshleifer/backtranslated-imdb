['I&#39;m so glad I had the chance to see this weird little gem of a movie. I saw him at an independent film festival, so do not expect him to come to your city soon. During the movie, I noticed that about 10 people get up and leave. Too bad for them (here in the south, people do not like to have to read the subtitles). The movie starts slowly, but it&#39;s so rich in dialogue that I never felt bored. When the action finally arrives, I found myself stuck to the screen as if I was riding a roller coaster. <br /><br /> I also received a large sample of the titles of the chapters that appear before the chapters, especially those that present the characters as they appear on the screen. It reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when you face level bosses. <br /><br /> If this is the future of &quot;videogame / comics&quot; movies, then I welcome it.']
