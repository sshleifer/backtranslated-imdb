Herbet Clutter, his wife Bonnie and their teenage sons Kenyon and Nancy were very dear and respected in their small town of Holcomb, Kansas, but in the early hours of November 14, 1959 the four were brutally murdered. Rather unexpectedly, the crime caused an impression on the author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking and exceptionally well written, it became an international sales success and remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day. <br /> <br /> The film version of Capote 1967 is almost as remarkable as the book. itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the places of real life, it has a slightly documentary quality, frozen and distant, and the general cast is exceptional. This is the film in which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so. Like killer Perry Smith, Blake catches you between deep disgust and the impact of unexpected sympathy; It is a masterful performance from start to finish. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less good. <br /> <br /> Like Capote's book, the film begins with Smith and Hickock when they travel to Kansas and takes them to Clutter's house, only to suddenly get past crime to detail the investigation which ultimately resulted in his arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the film has always been the moment when we finally see what happened in Clutter's house; filmed in the house of Clutter itself, it is a thorny sequence, horrible and deeply disturbing. <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that it allows the film to become a little preaching. However, given the general power of the film, this becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong, and recommended things. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
