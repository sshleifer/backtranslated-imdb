This is an "odyssey through time" through computer animation, supposedly the work of more than 300 artists. Made in the late 80's and released in 1990, this was a cutting-edge theme for the day. I thought it was good and quite interesting in some places. <br /> <br /> Most of the short scenes did not make sense, only shapes that evolved into other shapes, but it was fun to watch them. This is about images, not about any kind of story. There were some strange sequences in which creatures of strange-looking men danced around with birds heard. Everything is animated by computer, which was new at that time. Even the term "computer-animated" was not well known. <br /> <br /> It is simply an opportunity to show off this new technology in small fragments of cartoon events with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. Without words, only photos with electronic music. Stoners must have really loved this. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful and intriguing 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "candy for the head". Because of CG's effects today, this may have lost its impact, but I think you would still be entertained with this.
