This was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a pretty accurate view of bulimia and that it's not about dieting, it's about having such a deep pain that you have to find a way to deal with it and choose it. Beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mother about the eating disorder, you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she feels. I also think that one of the best lines of the film is where Beth shouts the words: "It's not about you." to his mother Those words were so true and added a lot to that scene in the movie. I think that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.
