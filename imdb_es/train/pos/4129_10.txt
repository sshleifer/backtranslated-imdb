It's a show cooking contest, Americanized. It will not be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I could care less about cooking, but this show is simply entertaining to watch ... From the intensity put on the plates by the chef to the silly president. Truly a good way to spend time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You could criticize the program for having guests like Marc Ecko as judge ... But ... Meh. It's entertaining enough to see and, in general, the winner deserves the prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and I'm bitter. John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
