As a community theater actor who works hard on that but does not take acting too seriously, I am always amused by those who treat it as a great art. This film overshadows the "Actor's Craft" mercilessly while causing much laughter. <br /> <br /> A ham actor in the place of a movie looks like the dictator. When the dictator dies of a heart attack for drinking and overeating, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "the role of a lifetime" by the neo-Nazi chief of the secret service. He plays to the fullest, gets the dictator's girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa, and makes the tables of his captors beautifully beautiful. <br /> <br /> Very many traps by the protagonists, a lot of work by some unknown secondary actors, particularly the house staff and two members of the palace guard, and the funny little cameos abound. Sammy Davis Jr. clarifies himself, Jonathan Winters plays a semi-retired American businessman with something else, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and, above all, Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a silly movie, but it has many beautiful places (in Brazil), a comic script and good actors who do their thing and who seem to have fun and not go through the usual existential angst about what is just act
