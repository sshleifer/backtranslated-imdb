HLOTS was an outstanding series, it is what NYPD Blue will never be, in HLOTS the plots are real, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. With HLOTS back as a movie, Tying all the loose ends, it was good to have the whole gang again, even a few who died appear (we will not say how) The story was quick, emotional and full of spirit. The series had week after week. Homicide, life on the streets, network drama at its BEST !!!! 5 STARS!!!! Thumbs up and all that. Thanks NBC for giving us the last one we did not get!
