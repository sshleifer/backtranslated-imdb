['&quot;The Straight Story&quot; is a truly beautiful film about an old man named Alvin Straight, who rides his lawn mower across the country to visit his dead and distant brother. But that&#39;s just the basic synapse ... this movie is much more than that. This was the last role of Richard Farnworth before his death, and it is definitely one for which he will be remembered. He is a stubborn old man, not unlike many of the old men you and I probably know. <br /><br /> &quot;The Straight Story&quot; is a movie that everyone should see at least once in their lives. It will reach and touch a part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will.']
