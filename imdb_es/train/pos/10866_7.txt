['The CHOICE of Johnnie To has some good music in the opening credits, and also a good design of opening credits, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian mobsters solemnly swearing or saying something sacred; In fact, the whole movie is well punctuated. I have found information about A from Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and was anxious to see a To film. The one I started with, ELECTION, is exciting and interesting, and only moderately violent according to current standards: moderate and also essentially violent; The story of the schemes of an Asian godfather, uses a game of elements, violent facts of the life of the mobsters, the race for the scepter, true details, and it is expected that with Coppola we believe that some of the morally glamorous mobsters are Titled and nice and friendly. The performances are quite funny and colorful. <br /><br /> The CHOICE is well done in the pleasant and somewhat neglected style of the Hong Kong rate; The ending is bitter, real, direct and will scare the children.']
