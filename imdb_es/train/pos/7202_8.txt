Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years earlier), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two men kissing passionately on the screen and, frankly, I was surprised. I understood it in terms of the plot, and it did not really alter my sensitivity (not much), but it was the first time I saw it, at least, in a "conventional" movie. I thought it was a brave move for its time, and I was encouraged to try it, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as Superman with PG rating. Male bisexuality on the screen may have reached its rhythm with "Brokeback", but it is interesting to note this incarnation much earlier.
