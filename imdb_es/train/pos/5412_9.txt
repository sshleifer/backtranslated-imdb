As a Pokémon fan I really enjoyed this movie. Enter new legendary Pokémon (as each movie does) and add depth to the relationships between their characters. However, I do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to enjoy it (this includes most adults). Some of the lines were cheesy, but that can be something inevitable when the movie is dubbed into English. The animation was beautiful, although there were a couple of parts that did not look good. And although the villain is a little cheesy, I think the movies have done a good job of cycling between different types of villains, and I guarantee they are not all like that. Those who did not like it, I tell everyone what's theirs, but Pokémon fans will love it.
