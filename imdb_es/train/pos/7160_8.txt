A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be rewarded for its effort. The "holes" do not make the same mistakes one would expect from a Disney movie about teenagers with problems placed in a camp. For the first time the events are not explained in detail. The flashback scenes really have a purpose and present several mature themes that can surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a little disconcerted by the seriousness of the film. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to the story, this film also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional institutions. (An example where Caveman is prohibited from teaching Zero to read because they have to dig holes to build character, since learning to read will not contribute to that). "Holes" is a movie that is intelligent and beautiful. A must see!
