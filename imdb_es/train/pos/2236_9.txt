What I remember most about this movie is that it used to air on local KTLA TV (Chapter 5) during each Christmas season from the mid to late 70s, mainly due to the fact that the real story took place on or near Christmas Eve. . . It was always a bit disturbing to see the hell this girl goes through, being the only survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this young woman drawing leeches from her infected leg caused a great impression on this young spectator. It was not exactly the kind of Christmas cheer she was used to seeing at that moment. It's definitely not a Rankin-Bass production.
