Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people alive on a mission in Guatemala in the 70s. He also claimed that he had killed another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women and then set them on fire). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that portrays the personality of Aro through several interviews with people who came to know him and through some scenes performed by actors based on real events. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious, analytical work, which is not morbid at all. Such a horrible testimony about how a childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
