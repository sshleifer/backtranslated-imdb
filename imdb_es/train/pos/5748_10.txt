This film was excellent: the emotional power of the performances of Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart: this movie shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this film had left at the end of 1988, instead of Rain Man, Hulce would have been at least nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. Definitely a must see!
