Lately there's a lot of trash in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> A friend, he sends me movies from time to time, as a surprise, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> I lit it and I could not stop looking, it's a drama, but with a strange twist. Imagine if Romeo, as in Shakepeare, had a superpower. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should take note of the new Russian cinema, they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and CGI. Take a simple basic premise and tell a story, without a show. This looks a lot like an Asian movie with a dark Russian twist. Of course it is not perfect, but nothing is ever. You know what power is, but it is never explained, nor is it fully realized until the end. It becomes secondary to the emotion of history. I do not want to see a remake, since it's too good, the Hollywood system, as usual, would spoil it. The acting is first class in everything. The direction and work of the camera are far above most of the trash there is. Congratulations to all involved, and I will convert many people into this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find i, look at it.
