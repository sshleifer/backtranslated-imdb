Obviously, not many people have seen this movie, because nobody is posting more comments. This is not a movie to get lost. After all, he has won the George Peabody Award and the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield should have won an award for his incredible acting in this film. Eugene Logan, who co-authored this film for television, was also part of another film about humanity, or his loss, as a technical consultant for the Glass House film by Truman Capote. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will publish another letter that tells how Eugene Logan became the technical advisor of a film of such an amazing person as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this and I hope you find a way to see these two movies.
