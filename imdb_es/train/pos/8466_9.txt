Like TALK RADIO, THE BOOTH is actually a little predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened, THE BOOTH because, let's face it, the genre and the basic configuration). That is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. It means, in essence, that the filmmakers do not flinch at the end of the way they could have, say, an American version of this story. THE BOOTH moves inexorably towards its (lost) conclusion, but it is so beautifully designed at all levels that you can enjoy the trip the way you can take a family cruise on a very busy section of a road (very picturesque) . It reminds me of the creepy tale of Harlan Ellison, FLOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is, at times, almost palpable. It is worth a good long look.
