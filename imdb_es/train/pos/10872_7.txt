The election marks the second thematic film of the society of judgments directed by Johnnie To. <br /> <br /> To Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai wonderfully chosen as Lok and Big D, as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of the president of the society Ho Sing, a test society 100 years old <br /> <br /> While Lok is a man who remains calm at all times, Big D is not only impatient, but also believes he is on top of everything. Lok was elected as the next president for 2 years. To have total control of the gang, the newly elected president must be transferred with a Battle Dragon, which represents power and authority. Big D was not very happy with the results, since he was not chosen to be the next president after paying a beautiful figure of bribes to the council members. He ordered his man to get the Batuta before it fell into Lok's hands. <br /> <br /> While Big D receives the Batuta, Lok has other plans for him. <br /> <br /> This is one of the thematic films of the trial society where it does not take much bloodshed. Johnnie To puts the greed of human beings in the film, where bloodshed is commonly used in other thematic films of the judging society to show how the greed of human beings can cause death or the fall of one. However, not a single bullet is used, almost no gang fight is involved in the Election. It is the battle of the mills that makes the Choice stand out from the rest. <br /> <br /> Aside from Maggie Shiu, the only actress in The Choice with less than 5 lines to talk about throughout the film, masculinity governs the entire movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung, who were seen in To's previous film, were chosen as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold their lives to the gang, respectively. Together with some of the veteran actors who make their appearance in the film and the excellent script, it is the only HK film that represents the Cannes Festival 2005. <br /> <br /> The election has almost failed to any critic I want a different trial movie themed society.
