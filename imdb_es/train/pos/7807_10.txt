The performance of each actor and actress (in the film) is excellent NATURAL, which is what the film's performance should be; and the ability to direct is handled so brilliantly in every detail that I never tire of seeing it again and again. However, I am quite surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and directors, the Attenborough credits that baffle me: are not they proud to say that they have made an excellent and lasting film for the audience? I hope to get some answers to my puzzle from someone (possibly one of the "insiders" of the staff (insider) of the film).
