The 1986 television movie The Spirit was a pilot of a possible series. However, the creator of Spirit Will Eisner did not like the film and, therefore, no series was produced. I thought it was a very entertaining film and I captured the spirit (sorry) of the comic with a modern touch. I regret that it has not materialized in a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect spirit. Nana Visitor was a good Ellen Dolan and, of course, then she would go to Star Trek: Deep Space nine years later. Perhaps with the release of Frank Miller's big-screen version of The Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare jewel in Spirit's story. It seems that when Hollywood makes a movie of a character or idea already established, someone will inevitably look for previous versions of the property and release it to the video to earn a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas donned the Zorro mask, we were able to obtain previous versions of the masked hero on DVD, such as the great version of Alain Delon from the 1970s (although all the copies I saw were poorly edited). Here we hope that someone launches the television adventure of The Spirit on DVD soon.
