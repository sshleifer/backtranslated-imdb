This is an excellent but difficult to find trippy spy thriller from World War I in the inimitable Italian style of the 60s. This is a movie that should not be missed. It is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the cruelty of players on and off the battlefield. Apart from the battle scenes, some of the productions and special effects are primitive, apparently because most of the budget for this film was saved for battle scenes, but for movie lovers of the 60s it should not be a problem. The first time I saw this movie on television was many years ago and I had the foresight to record it on VHS. I still have the tape and I enjoy watching it from time to time.
