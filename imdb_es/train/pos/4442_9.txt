The Ogre is a film made for television in Italy and was not meant to be a sequel to Demons, since Lamberto Bava even mentioned it in the interview on the Sheirk Show DVD, but it was called Demons III to be part of the Demons series . The music in Demons and Demons 2 was rock music from the 80s, while this is more creepy music and while the first two were bloody horror. Demons III: The Ogre is an architectural horror, this is how Demons III is not a continuation of Demons, but still like this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle where the movie is played. The ogre is another reason why I like the movie. There are two other movies that are classified as Demons III and that are Black Demons (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demons III: The Ogre is a good movie as long as you do not compare it with Demons and Demons 2.
