My wife and I took our 13 year old son to see this movie and we were absolutely delighted with the fun of the movie. It has an additional appeal for children and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the film and, especially, the chorus of Hallie Kate Eisenberg, "children are very rare." It is comforting to see a film that shows, without apologies, that boys and girls are really different in their emotional and social composition. Children really do this kind of weird stuff and they usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers! We enjoyed the movie so much that my son and a friend of 11 years, me and my daughters, the boyfriend of 23 years, went to see the movie the next day for a day of boys. We had even more fun the second time and everyone was excited about it. It's clean and deliciously played by a pre-teen cast that resembles the TV classic "Freaks and Geeks." We all feel that it will become a sleeping success not unlike the "Freaks & Geeks" that did not survive their first season, but sold out their DVD release. See it especially if you have children and you will find that it stimulates conversation about fun and safety! Girls will love it for the opportunity it offers when they say, "Kids are so weird!" Do not miss it ...
