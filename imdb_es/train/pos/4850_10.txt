So your children are far away in a dream? Is the wife visiting the mother-in-law? Although you are at home. Is it a dark and stormy night and there is no football on TV and the dishwasher needs to be stacked? Now what are you gonna do? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> Go make an old cocoa (Frys is the best!) Take some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now, select and play Arthur Askey's thriller / horror, World War II, The Phantom Train, return to that comfortable couch and enjoy the night! <br /> <br /> The ghost train is a real British war classic! Arthur Askey with his side kick, Stinker Murdoch, entertains you and I suspect the cast, to a high octane, emotions and spills, suspense of espionage. It is set in ancient rural England during World War II. <br /> <br /> It centers around a heterogeneous group of people who need to spend the night, through circumstances beyond the control of anyone, in an old waiting room of a railway that they discover is being chased by an old man train. <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds perfectly and precisely, and it is a merit for all the cast, it is humorous in some places and, sometimes, really scary! <br /> <br /> (The story was written by the boy Godfrey of Dads Army fame and is smart) <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey is entertaining and is at home preparing his routines for you and Him cast, it also shows that you can act a little! However, the cast is never out of the picture, even the railroad doorman and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas. <br /> <br /> And when it's over, remember to stack the dishwasher!
