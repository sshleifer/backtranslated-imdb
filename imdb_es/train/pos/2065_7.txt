The fearful symmetry is a pleasant episode with some flaws. The first thing in the episode is that it takes place near the Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwestern Idaho. The 'Deep Throat' season takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in southwestern Idaho. I wonder if the air force bases are the same, but decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always an advantage. Ed Meecham, the zookeeper, reminds me of the bad-tempered old-school teachers. They must have liked the kids at the same time, you just can not imagine how. Just like he must have taken more care of the animals at any given time. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt I had some inconsistencies. If extraterrestrials are so adept at kidnapping humans and returning them safely, why can not they return the animal to the right place? And the aliens just had trouble returning the animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum. As if he were an expert in that. I also thought that Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not well done. Besides those nitpicks, I still enjoyed this episode due to the intriguing concept of extraterrestrials that extract animal DNA and human DNA.
