The Secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful and eye-catching animated films I've ever seen. Before watching this film, I was convinced that nothing could allow a race for your money and that it was a must to win in this category, but I found in Kells a serious competitor. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, the abbot of Kell. The Abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a little too strict and much more concerned about strengthening the wall around the city of an attack by the Vikings than by feeding the imagination of the child. When the legendary Brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) appears and takes the child under his wing, Brendan goes on a trip through the forest and meets a lovely nymph of the forest named Aisling who likes (and saves her lifetime). more than once). With the help of Aisling, he tries to save the city and help Brother Aidan to complete the mystical book that, according to legend, can turn into darkness into light. <br /> <br /> See my full review of The Secret of Kells at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-kells.html
