I loved this movie, and I am one of the older people who are not supposed to enjoy it, or so it seems. No, this movie is not deep, who cares? This kind of movies are never. But strangely, there is a message in it. Is that each of us has the potential to be what we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this movie. I've always thought she looks a lot like Katharine Hepburn. So, it's great to see that both Hepburn and Posey made films about librarians (Hepburn is The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an 8. It is not, by any means, a great movie for the cinematographic standards, although there are some good pictures. in that. But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
