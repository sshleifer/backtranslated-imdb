Tigerland is one of the best movies I've seen, and in my opinion, it even exceeds the full metal jacket, a movie of a similar nature. Bozz is played exceptionally well by Farrell, and is a character that remains in your mind long after the movie ends. The end is brilliant cut by Schumacher, with the song of melodic harmony and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave. What movie.
