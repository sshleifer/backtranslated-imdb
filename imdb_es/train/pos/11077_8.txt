First, do not go into Revolver waiting for another Snatch or Lock Stock, this is a different kind of gangster movie. <br /> <br /> I watched the gala the other night and this movie definitely divided the audience. It's the kind of movie where half the audience will be thinking. WHAT was that? That was horrible, and the other half will be thinking WHAT was that? That was cool. Personally, I like movies that I do not understand, that is, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, so I enjoyed Revolver. <br /> <br /> It was definitely not perfect. I saw the great turn that was looming a mile away, at least in part, and although sometimes there are some loose ends without explanation, Revolver leaves MANY questions unexplained for no reason. Also some scenes, such as animation, and the scene in which Sorter makes a killing (actually one of my favorites), although, incredible scenes to see, seemed to be there because they were incredible to see, not because they fit with the film. <br /> <br /> However, there were also many good things. I thought that the performance was magnificent of all the main actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (which was a pleasant surprise). This movie definitely kept my interest, with a great suspense scene, full of action, one after the other. When Ray Liotta was under the table wow ... well, you have to see it. The script was very well done, and the soundtrack, as in most of Guy Ritchie's films, was excellent. <br /> <br /> Although one step below movies like Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, there was still an incredible action movie, psychological and fast-paced, with many twists and thousands of scenes that you'll remember much later that the movie ends.
