Other critics have summed up this black movie well. I just wanted to add to the phrase "Whew!" comment a critic made with respect to the episode of drums of Elisha Cook, obviously fed by coke. This was a doozy, I must say. Cook deserved some praise for his frenetic performance. <br /> <br /> A little curiosity I suppose: Cook appeared as a bartender in the 1941 film Barbara Stanwyck, "Ball of Fire". He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara sang and the legendary drummer Gene Krupa was playing drums, with more energy. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's vibrant drummer in the most recent film, "Phantom Lady," was very inspired by Krupa's work, as Cook testified three years earlier? <br /> <br /> If you see Krupa in "Fireball", I think you will notice some clearly similar body movements. It is expected, of course, that the SE has not been influenced by any drugs at that time!
