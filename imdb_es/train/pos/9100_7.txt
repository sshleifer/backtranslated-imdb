['Spanish films are in one, if not Golden, definitely a Silver Age. Pi√©dras is another example of a film that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although the feelings are strong or almost at the level of life or death, they are not really melodramatic yet. This could happen. <br /><br /> There are different stories here, that connect. One is about the delayed girl, who does not dare to cross the street to the next block. One of them is about the middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetishist. Another is about the girl with drug problems that her lover abandons her. Another one is about the lady in a brothel who (almost) finds true love. <br /><br /> Definitely worth seeing. It is in Spain that filmmakers take women seriously.']
