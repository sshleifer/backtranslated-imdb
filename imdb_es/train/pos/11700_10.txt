['I have read most of the comments in this movie. I have seen this movie (and the whole series of prophecies) many times with relatives of all ages, we all enjoyed and only made us meditate on what we already knew when reading and studying the Bible about the rapture and the end times. No one was scared or traumatized as I read in some publications. The movie is based simply on biblical facts. I have seen many films of recent times &quot;Tribulation&quot;, &quot;Armagedon&quot;, etc., and this is one of the best in presenting biblical truths. It may not have many fantastic special effects like today&#39;s movies, but I think it&#39;s a good tool to witness. This movie and its prophecy series can be viewed for free on this higherpraise.com website, and judge for yourself. Blessings to all.']
