Any true wrestling fan should consider this Wrestlemania one of the best, if not the best, of all. It was full of excitement and surprises. One of the best matches of all time was between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin with special guest Mike Tyson. The show that Michaels put on was incredible, especially considering how his back was and that this was his last game.
