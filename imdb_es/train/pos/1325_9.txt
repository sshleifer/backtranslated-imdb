I saw this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and I was completely intrigued during the 106 minutes. I like documentaries, but I often find them dragging with about 25 minutes to go. However, Forbidden Lie $ went on, never losing my interest. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story of She refers to a Muslim friend who was murdered by his family for having a relationship with a Christian man. However, a few years later, some journalists began to make holes in the story, which led the public to believe that it was a fraud. The film covers this quickly but thoroughly at first, and from there we spend most of our time in Norma's company while trying to convince us that her novel is more than fiction. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broinowski has found a really fascinating woman to study, and she conducts endless interviews with Khoury while searching for the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life, worried about a violent reaction to the nasty portrait her novel depicts of Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and show us the facts. Broinowski, however, is not dissuaded, and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look inside the mind of a scammer. Naturally, what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow, and ultimately we do not know whether to believe Norma or not. Either she's a pretty unfair woman trying to survive, or a fantastic old maid. The network of lies, truths and half-truths that the film goes through is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses many sequences of interviews, as well as dramatizations to tell its story, and Broinowski uses these dramatizations to show us why people like Norma can exist: we want to be scammed. We go to the cinema every day and we allow ourselves to believe that what happens on the screen is real. Maybe I was just reading things too much, it did not come up in the question and answer session with Brionowski after the movie, but that's what I took away from him. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian. film, and you should receive an international release, and a prize pool if you ask me. Certainly, the best movie I saw in AFF07. <br /> <br /> Go see it, if you have the opportunity.
