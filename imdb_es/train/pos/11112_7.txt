Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with THE GODFATHER, add a bit of Roman mythology and a lot of low-profile comedy, and you have THE SOPRANOS, about a gang of gangsters operating from northern New Jersey. It's almost as entertaining as professional wrestling. I am not the biggest fan of this program, but I admire the very complicated Tony Soprano of James Gandolfini, a psychopath with an occasional flash of consciousness. I have also come to admire the contributions of people like Dom Chianese with a gravelly voice like the bewildered but murderous Uncle Junior, Tony Sirico with silvery hair as perplexed Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco as the duplicate and tough carmela. Soprano. The violence is sudden and graphic, the count of bodies increases constantly each season, but often it is the small moments that matter most here. Watch Paulie and Tony's nephew, Christopher (Michael Imperioli at the end of LAW & ORDER) as they get lost in Pine Barrens and spend a cold, cold night in an abandoned truck, both convinced they had it.
