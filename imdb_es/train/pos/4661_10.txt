I can only echo the compliments of the other comments here. It is a charming film with a factor of well-being that it achieves without crossing the line towards an insipid sentimentality. Naturally sweet - no added sugar. <br /> <br /> A small point: it seems to me that the slight objections raised about the fact that Ustinov's character, Pendelton, can enter and defeat the security of the system, ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius. wise in this kind of thing. Yes, the movie was quite illiterate for computers, but it showed Pendelton "studying computers" in his apartment, and I think the implication was that his gifts allowed him to simply cover the whole subject, practically overnight . <br /> <br /> There were some strange moments when he appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to prove Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I'm not sure if we were supposed to believe that Pendelton had cleverly slipped out of these situations, or if he really had enough knowledge to pass the tests; It was not clear. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I had to know enough to set up the fictitious accounts. Presumably, Wallach and Ustinov relied on their own somewhat confused notion of how computers worked in those days, and to understand in detail what they were talking about, it is necessary to know what their concept was. They knew there was something about the "procedures" that was important; they thought that 'intelligent light' could really control security, instead of simply indicating its state; they thought that the characteristics of the user terminal (dumb) would greatly influence what could be done in the mainframe itself, although, apart from things like the graphics feature, I do not see it myself. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I think they tried to avoid the issue of real computer operations as much as possible, and they did quite well. Allowing them a bit of artistic license, I do not think their efforts have flaws worthy of being noticed. <br /> <br /> CD
