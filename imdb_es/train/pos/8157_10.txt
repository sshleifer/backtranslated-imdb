R rating for strong language, violent content and some nudity. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> Fear Of A Black Hat is one of the funniest and most original comedies I've ever seen. It's basically a gangsta rap version of the movie This Is Spinal Tap. It's a shame that not many people have heard about this movie jewel. If you can find this movie anywhere, do not hesitate to buy it even if you do not like rap music. There are not too many comedy movies that I give a perfect 10/10. The only ones I can think of at this moment are this movie, Clerks, The World according to Garp, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Chasing Amy. This movie is a hilarious stereotype of gangsta rap. culture. The film is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional rap band NWH (N **** z with hats). Basically they are the stereotype of a rap group that makes many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta. Fear of a black hat is an excellent comic movie and I recommend it even if you're not a fan of the gangsta rap scene. It's a shame that this movie is not in the Top 250. <br /> <br /> Duration: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
