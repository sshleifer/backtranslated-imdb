This movie is one that I highly recommend. This is a child, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf) who was wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, a children's detention center. There, he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diameter. While there, he meets the other children in the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray, and ZigZag). All of them are digging, not to "build character", but to discover the treasure of Kate Barlow. Throughout the film (and the book), Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself and more about digging holes. I give this movie a 9.5, because I'm very demanding when it comes to books and movies (I want the movie to follow the book EXACTLY). But, he still did very well.
