"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial art movies I had the chance to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese peasant who comes to visit a friend of the city. Like Tang Lung from "Way of the Dragon." Wherever Sammo goes, the problems begin, therefore, he has to rely on his martial arts skills to resolve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly as Bruce Lee does and also releases his squeaky scream. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like looking at a fat Bruce Lee. There is a big confrontation near the end of the movie that consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to face each opponent one by one. Something like "The Game of Death", where each fighter has a martial art discipline different from each other. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that I really enjoyed watching and also the first Sammo Hung movies. 'You've seen. Excellent fighting scenes and lots of laughs. A rare classic Sammo Hung movie that I recommend to all fans of martial art. 8.5 / 10!
