An American in Paris is a showcase for Gene Kelly. See how Gene sings, acts and dances through Paris in any number of situations. Some purely majestic, others pure corn. One can imagine what Kelly was made of when he made this movie just one year before "Singin 'In The Rain". It is definitely one of the greatest of all time. It is interesting to note the parallels between the two films, especially Kelly's characters, the only main difference being that one is based in Paris, the other in Los Angeles. Some have said that Leslie Caron's performance was less than pure Perhaps Cyd Charisse, who was originally destined for the role, could have done better, however, Caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's brief role in this film gave him just what he needed, someone who does not look like Gene Kelly. Completing the role as the common man is not an easy task, however, Levant did it with as much class as with any other leader. <br /> <br /> The routines of song and dance are all perfection. Even the ballet too long at the end of the film makes it a better movie with her than without her. Seeing that there really was not much time on the screen to make such a loving relationship believable, Minnelli used this sequence to make it look like you spent four hours with them. Witty! <br /> <br /> I would have to rate this movie with Singin 'since it's very similar in story and song. Singin 'would barely get the nod due to the uplifting performance of Debbie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
