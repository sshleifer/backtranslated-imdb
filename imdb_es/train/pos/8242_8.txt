I saw FIDO in a movie channel and I must say that I have become an instant fan. The film feels like a comic that perfectly captures the appearance of the surreal 50s, you know the healthy decade in which they danced to Elvis while throwing nuclear bombs in the desert just for the fun of it. People were so naive at the time that it's scary and the idea that clean-cut people think it's normal to have zombies as pets really works here. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to this Canadian production, the sharp and colorful cinematography and the excellent cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the boy. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that this movie has not been a huge success. He deserved more recognition. It's much better than the things of Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team. Oh good. It's an instant classic though.
