I really enjoy this movie. Most of the criticism has been bad, but most critics think that a movie should be like a drama of ideas. This movie has a bit of drama, but the rest is pure fun and very entertaining. Forget that Julia Roberts is a Pretty Woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young woman and there is more to her than just that. Emma was very funny to see in the role of Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I think it will go very far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on the books, but the story is still good. There is also a good combination of actors from other characters and supporting actors such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan, not accredited. I'm surprised that Disney has not released this movie. Some people do not like this movie because it does not contain sex, violence and curse. This is a good family movie that is rare on this day in time. So take your family, see this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can not wait for the sequel.
