This film, despite its low budget, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've seen in my life. If you accept that the budget is low from the beginning, you can appreciate how good a story is, how well written the script is and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money. <Br /> <br /> All the elements of a great movie are here. The images, although taken in digital format, were beautiful in some places. The strange and dreamy feeling of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was simply amazing. It's such a trivial job, but not done pretentiously, and that's why I have a lot of respect for this movie. It is highly recommended for anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from many of the repetitive movies there are.
