I enjoyed this movie and had very low expectations due to all the negative reviews I read before going. I went because I was curious to know what all this fuss was about because some of the publications were very angry with this movie and the Koreans. Oh, and it's from Korea, which has published some of my favorite movies. I liked Host but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite science fiction / fantasy movies so you can get an idea of ​​my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> It was not confusing as everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles were great. There are some holes in the story, but it did not really matter. Somehow I disconnected things like that and stopped asking why a long time ago when I see the summer box office hits. The Korean legend was interesting, the things of reincarnation were different, and I thought that the main characters dressed suspiciously like Korean actors in other shows. Ethan's hair (Behr) looked so Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its peculiar sense of life, intense emotions and unexpected mood in the future, can contribute something. Diversity to the box office genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
