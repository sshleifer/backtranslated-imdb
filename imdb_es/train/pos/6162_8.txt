I loved this masterpiece and, frankly, I also found Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke) as silly and sweet of sacrifice. Angela Lansbury plays her character perfectly and I do not know why people think that this movie is distorted. It was magical and it was very fun to watch it. Each scene had a certain charm as you knew the characters better. You will truly see how this little reunited family learns to unite with each other, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles who was in "The Age of Not Believing." Mary Poppins may be more popular and appreciated by others, but this little gem will be the one I will always love and appreciate.
