Although written by Stephen King, an overrated writer if there ever was one, this is actually a fairly entertaining B movie. Vampiric and incestuous creatures that live in the house by candlelight and drain the life force of the virgins, the great cemetery scene, the heroic cats and the very beautiful virgins. The soundtrack even has the music of Enya, an idea that I found quite ... nice. I am sure that King is disappointed with this little movie, although he has poor quality dialogs and ideas, all of them from a real and tedious king potboiler. (Although the somnambulists, if they understand me well, is a script without any novel or short story). Still, those touches of sewer odors show that he did not use a ghostwriter after all ...
