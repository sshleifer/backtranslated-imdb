Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are approaching rock stars in the present future, but they still need more work on their instruments. In the future, Bill and Ted are in public popular history, but then an evil man (Joss Ackland) is willing to kill Bill and Ted by sending a cyborg appearance to destroy them. The Cyborgs are sent to the present present and actually kill the real Bill & Ted. Now, both are spirits and they have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) made an intelligent sequel with incredible visual effects. . Much more fun and entertaining than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) steals the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a good anamorphic widescreen transfer (1.85: 1) and a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD has the theatrical trailer and entertaining entertainment behind the scenes. This sequel was a blockbuster like the original, but it is also (believe it or not), one of the best sequels ever made (according to your point of view). George Carlin briefly takes his role from the original. Pam Grier also appears in a small role. It's a nice fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
