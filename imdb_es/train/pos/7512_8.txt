['First of all, I&#39;ve heard great things about this film, among which are the retro / vintage scene and the lovers of stockings who love Bettie Page and they did not disappoint me. Shot in very clean black and white with added color for the key scenes, the film gives a documentary touch to Bettie Page&#39;s early life and career. <br /><br /> There are many things that I did not know about. In the first place, the group rape took place, later, their first attempts to develop an acting career and then glamor photos, first with a chamber club populated by men who do not get tired of it and later with Klaws, Paula and Irving, who despite taking photos of bondage and fetishes, are presented as extremely nice and friendly people. If only the producers of modern pornography were like that, maybe a better pornography would be a consequence! For the most part, the film is not a diatribe against the evils of pornography, but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the 1950s for those who produce fetish and naked images of women. This environment was extremely repressive, perhaps in a good way because it meant that none of the &quot;saturation&quot; effects that we have today, when it comes to pornography, existed. It also seemed to be much less hard. The page appears as someone who enjoys his work and does not seem to be degraded by it. In many of her photos she is seen tied up and gagged (and trying to hold a conversation), brandishing a whip with an elegant gesture, which causes photographers to take pictures and be seen in initiation-style bondage movies, that look quite tame in comparison. With the hardcore we have now. <br /><br /> Page never became an actress and instead abandoned Pinup when she was in her thirties by &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. Her belief in God and Jesus never disappears, even when she is bound and gagged, she still insists that God has given her a &quot;gift&quot; to do &quot;this&quot;. When I see this film, I know Page more and I am amazed at his modesty, his beliefs and his behavior. She is unique in her class, compared to the identi-kit clone blondes we have today and someone who can really say &#39;There is life after porn&#39;.']
