This film is directed by Renny Harlin, the Finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and mouse in the mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to direct the action movie. Stallone needed this role to get back on track. Snowy Mountain is a very good place for the action movie and who is better to direct the film where there is snow, ice, cold and bad weather than the Finnish man. The action is good! The music in the movie is spectacular. The bad guy is John Litghow, other stars Micheal Rooker (Serialkiller's portrait), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). It is placed in a beautiful place and it is a very exciting movie. In general, good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember Extreme ääliöt: special edition for collectors, with good extras. Coming soon in Finland directly to the video.
