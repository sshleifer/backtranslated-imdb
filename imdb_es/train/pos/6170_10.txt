I saw this movie at the Taos Film Festival last year, and I felt overwhelmed. It is a rich and warm novel brought to the screen, beautifully acted and well directed. More than anything, it reminded me of David Lean's films, both for his ability to handle a complex story and for his ability to create powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels. The best movie I've seen in years.
