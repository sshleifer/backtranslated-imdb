The emotional impact of this movie challenges the words. It's elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic, all in two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures in his ability to act, his whole range. Who knows? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and I thought, this must be a coincidence for the blockbuster, Smith. Their performances in both films represent a completely different dimension to Smith, a refinement of the talent, the selectivity of the scripts, I'm not sure, but now I see it differently. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief. Do not look at the plot, look at the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love and sacrifice.
