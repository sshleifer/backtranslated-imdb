Stargate is the best show of all time. All the actors are absolutely perfect for their roles. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show, I highly recommend it. Although this program compares to Star Trek most of the time, it really can not be because it is completely different. I'm a Star Trek fan, but I would definitely rate this show well above any of the Star Treks. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not have Stargate on our TV, so if I want to watch it, I have to buy the DVDs and season 10 is not here yet, so I can not watch it for quite some time (which is highly depressing). However, this program is very good and you have to see it, but keep in mind that it is highly addictive. So in summer I Love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
