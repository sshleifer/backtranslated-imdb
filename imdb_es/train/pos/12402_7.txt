**Warning! Spoilers ahead! ** <br /> <br /> This short is the first part of two that expose the brief portion of "The Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix was formed. As we already know the story, the plot itself is no surprise; And the short is not as entertaining as it is informative. But this is how it is presented, as a file in the historical archives. The images are better than average, and the generally cold colors help the purpose of the short. <br /> <br /> A couple of problems. The violence of the story is a bit gratuitous and, combined with the occasional dose of political correctness (UN scenes), detracts from the direct narrative of the brief. In addition, you must see the second part to complete it. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix concept is brilliant and, despite some problems, this short still fulfills its purpose. It would not have fit in the original movie in style, content or flow. This is the perfect method to reveal the story. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: good information. It could have been said a little better, but it's still a solid 7 out of 10.
