The tighter the drama, the better the sister rivalry film will be. This little gem was promoted mainly as a comedy after its release in Sweden, so I'm glad to find out that it was not the whole case. The funny fragments of the fights in the small cities are there to enjoy, without a doubt, but the drama takes center stage, as the story progresses. And not only the family drama, it also raises moving questions about respect for differences in people's lifestyle choices. <br /> <br /> Great set of characters with many spectacular and moving scenes that add credibility points. And not only are they scattershot, but they keep everything in their place. It just makes me suppose that if Ingmar Bergman had done this (the drama would suit him!), The international attention would probably have been immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 from Ozjeppe.
