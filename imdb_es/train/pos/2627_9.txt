Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their own movie ... <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is a new and irreverent version of a classic tale. What classic tale, you ask? Why, 'The Lion King' of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there's one thing that Disney never lacks, it's narcissism. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean that this is not a good movie. Basically, it is the events of 'The Lion King' as told from the perspective of Timon and Pumba. And this is why you will have to memorize the story of 'The Lion King' to see where they come from. <br /> <br /> Anyway, on one level I was watching this and thinking. "Oh, my God, this is so boring ..." and on another level I was having a ball. Much of the humor is predictable. I mean, when Pumbaa makes two beds, one big for him and one small for Timon, within the first nanosecond, we all know that Timon is going to take the big one. But that does not stop it from being hilarious, which, in my opinion, is 'Hakuna Matata' in a few words. It's not what happens, it's how. <br /> <br /> And a note of caution: there are also some jokes about farts. Seriously, did you expect anything more in a movie in which Pumbaa occupies a central place? But, as the jokes say, these are especially good and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseurs. <br /> <br /> The voice talent that comes back is excellent. I'm a little surprised that some of the actors were willing to come back, and most of them only have two or three lines (if they're lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is particularly welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is also great. From 'Digga Tunnah' at the beginning to 'That's all I need', an adaptation of 'Warthog Rhapsody' (a song that was cut from 'The Lion King' and that frankly has improved a lot in this incarnation), the music leave with nothing to complain about at all. <br /> <br /> In the end, Timon and Pumbaa are amazing characters, and although it can be argued that 'Hakuna Matata' is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and diverse situations. then so be it. It is rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with. <br /> <br /> Am I starting to sound creepy? <br /> <br /> Either way, 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is great if you've seen 'The Lion King' too many times. Especially if you're thinking right now about "Do not be silly, there's no such thing as seeing 'The Lion King' many times!"
