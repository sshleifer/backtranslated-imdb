Chris Gerolmo was careful not to simply give us a kind of list of people killed as "Jack-the-stripper": he went into psychological characterization with convincing results. Perhaps due mainly to the excellent performance of Stephen Rea against Donald Sutherland with good empathy on both sides. Was the interpretation of these two parts? especially ?? that made the film more than a morbid description of the Rostov butcher's story. The supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, played their parts very well. Good direction Photography was also good. Needless to say, the fact that the film was filmed in Hungary was destined to produce a couple of aberrations, but, frankly, given the depth of the narration and the interpretations, we can completely forget this little triviality. <br /> <br /> For once, a movie made for HBO television has come out triumphant. Recommended, especially if you like to analyze features and forget some of the morbid scenes? Which, I hasten to add, is never exaggerated.
