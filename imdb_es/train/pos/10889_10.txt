What's up with all the negative comments? After having seen this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that will surely brighten the day of any lonely person. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could end up spending the holidays alone, I wanted to cry. You will have to see the movie if you want to know why. Also, although I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if you ask me, they were real snobs. However, this movie made me smile and feel good inside. Before finishing this, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has achieved a pure party success. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this good Christmas comedy that will surely brighten the day of any lonely person to any fan of Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate who has not seen it.
