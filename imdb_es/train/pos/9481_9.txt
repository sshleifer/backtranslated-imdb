Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not only in the year it was filmed, but also now. It is an art film that is not outdated even in the 21st century. The director maintained a good narrative ability and, therefore, made the story so fluid. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the film of the new French wave later: "Femme d'a cote" by Francois Truffaut, which is a similar theme.
