As an anti-soccer person, (on the surface) I reluctantly took my younger brother to see this movie, although he secretly hoped that it could be that the East is East II. The trailers seemed fun, so I thought I would try. <br /> <br /> It took me about ten minutes, but after that they hit me on the screen, and that had nothing to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too close to the front because of a crowded auditorium. The performance was fresh and vibrant, the characters attractive and the jokes genuinely funny. The whole audience was laughing with laughter every minute or so. A football fan or a non-football fanatic, sport became irrelevant to the fundamental principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a pinch of Sikh culture and you will have the formula of the best British comedy I've seen in a long time, I dare say it ... better than East is East. <br /> <br /> This movie trots along a pleasant rhythm, without stopping at anything longer than necessary or leaving nothing unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. Although it is not a characteristic movie of twists and turns, there are some pleasant surprises along the way and things do not always happen as you would expect. <br /> <br /> That said, there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically rather than used as script fills. I guess that depending on your particular predilection for happy endings, you could be delighted / disappointed by the end. Personally, if there was any other result, I would have written a very written letter to the script writers. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) had the best performance. . I never knew that people like that existed, but his realism with sometimes strange concepts has convinced me that maybe yes. The prize for the least convincing character (of the main characters) goes, unfortunately, for Kiera Knightley (Jules), but do not get me wrong, even she offered a great performance, it's just that someone has to be the last of the best and I feel Kiera, this time you are. <br /> <br /> Tip: Do not leave before the credits. Once the lights came on, I realized with horror that maybe I should not have seen this movie after all. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice. Oh, what am I saying, it was absolutely great and I can not recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and I'll add it to my collection of 3 videos. I am a student. I only splash if it's really worth it.
