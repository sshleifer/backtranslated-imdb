Henri Verneuil's film may not be as famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK, but it's certainly not worse and, sometimes, even better than these classic representatives of the genre. The action takes place in a fictitious western state where the fictional president has been murdered. After several years of investigation, the special government commission decides that the president was killed by a single gunman. But one man, prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand, believes that there is something more to investigate and so the movie begins. This film does not deal with some exact theories, but it covers the entire structure of relations between government and society in today's world. Such a film could be made only in the 70s, but it will never lose its relevance. In addition, it is even a little frightening how precise his oracles are. 10 out of 10
