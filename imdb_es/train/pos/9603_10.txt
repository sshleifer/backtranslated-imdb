I have a word for this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. The people in the theater sobbed. This film shows the difficulties Darius suffers from muscular dystrophy. The movie was very well made and really made you part of the movie. The film moved me emotionally because it made us remember that we are very lucky to be perfectly healthy, some people in this world are less strong than us. And sometimes we should give them help and help them, until the end. I would give them ten stars, they gave Darius once they did not ask for it, they did not do it for the money they made for a friend in need, Darius, the world should know, Darius went west.
