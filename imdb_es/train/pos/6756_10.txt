Otto Preminger, completing a noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, brought together his "Laura" leaders for this dramatic detective drama. Dana Andrews again portrays a police officer, but this time she has hardened, is cynical and her superior has accused him of police brutality: "You do not hate hoods, you liked to hit them!" Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises criminals, since his own father was a con man. He does not want to be "Sandy Dixon's boy", so he became a policeman, but his methods are harsh and hated. <br /> <br /> One night, investigating a murder, he unknowingly hits a suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) so hard that he kills him. A shaken Dixon does his best to hide it, with the intention of framing a hated bully, Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, the fault rests with Paine's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, departmental store model Morgan Taylor (Tierney) is separated from her husband, but remains involved in his game plans. Paine had slapped his wife, infuriating his father, who showed up at his son-in-law's apartment, but not until Dixon had left with the body. Without better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Harassed by guilt, Mark falls in love with Morgan and offers money for a lawyer. He decides to assume Scalise anyway, but leaves a letter to be delivered to the department in case of his death, confessing everything. In the end, he can not live with the knowledge of what he has done, and allows his superior and Morgan to read the letter. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes his love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this movie on DVD, after so many years of televised darkness. Eddie Mueller, a black film historian, provides the commentary and does a good job, but I think his claim that the public would not have grasped the meaning of the cast of the two protagonists, since "Laura" had been made six years earlier . In that sense, he is mistaken because they appeared in "The Iron Curtain" two years before WTSE and the movie was a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney were fabulous together, and Ruth Donnelly is a tremendous comic relief like the owner of a restaurant, Martha, stoking the flames between the detective and the lady. <br /> <br /> The nocturnal urban landscapes give the film an air of threat. Gary Merrill is great as Scalise, who had a criminal past with Dixon's father ("Your father loved me," taunts Mark). Karl Malden and a young Neville brand are also great. And Tom Tully is poignant and funny as Morgan's unjustly accused pop. <br /> <br /> A black cinema that can be seen with a fantastic cast.
