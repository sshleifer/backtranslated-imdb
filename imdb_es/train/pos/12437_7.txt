['As a fan of Peter O&#39;Donnell&#39;s greatest creation, I saw this movie on DVD without much hope of enjoyment; in fact, I expected to arrive in disgust at the remote control in fifteen minutes. But, on the other hand, I really enjoyed this production, and I especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and the director managed to tell the story of Modesty Blaise. They managed to avoid the trap of making a (bad) film version of the books that we are all so familiar with, choosing instead to focus on a period in Modesto&#39;s life that is only alluded to in novels. <br /><br /> As for the values of production (and I&#39;m not a student of cinematography!): Yes, the film was filmed with a tight budget and time and maybe that shows ... but does this spoil the enjoyment of the viewer? In this case I do not think so. Instead, they introduce us to one of the greatest literary heroines in the world and give us an idea of their abilities. <br /><br /> With regard to casting: because in unknown territory, the only people that really matter are Modestia and (perhaps) Professor Lob. For me they were totally credible. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wooden, and too thin to be a heroine of action, brought to the screen the poise and coldness of Modesty; his technique (when the martial arts were needed), but the most important thing is the personification of integrity that is at the core of Modesty Blaise&#39;s canon. <br /><br /> Okay, we all know that this movie was produced to make Miramax&#39;s claim about the character of Modesty Blaise, it was made quickly and economically, BUT ... for my part, I can not wait to see the next production of this series of these producers, always As they are maintained in the values and characterizations of the original stories!']
