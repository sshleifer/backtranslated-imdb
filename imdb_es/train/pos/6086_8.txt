I saw this movie about a year ago, and I found it completely funny about Laugh-Out-Loud. A true winner, in my opinion. He had the underline of a stupid comedy, but he also had a real plot. Like the hit comedy, Elf, in fact. He had some serious moments, interspersed between hilarity. When Stiller shot Black's horse, a rather sober moment, you found yourself laughing at his clumsy pranks. You can really find common ground there, since I'm sure many people have done something they did not want a friend to discover, so your friendship does not end. <br /> <br /> When I discovered how much. People did not like this movie, I was completely stunned. Those absolutely terrible films like Napoleon Dynamite had higher ratings than what makes me wonder about the sanity of people in IMDb. Follow my advice and rent it. If you do not find yourself laughing at least once, I will compensate you for the rental rate. = D
