Father of the Pride was the best new program to get to TV from Family Guy. It was another masterpiece of talented people in Dreamworks Animation. Like The Simpsons, the show focuses on a nuclear family (of white lions, in this case). It also contains many memorable characters such as Roger, the surly orangutan, Vincent, the Italian-American flamenco, the eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, the false patriots Snout Brothers and Chutney the elephant. The other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a great way, making the most mundane activities entertaining. The combination of friendly animal characters with a very adult dialogue and controversial issues (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the brilliance of the program. <br /> <br /> The fault of the failure of this program lies with NBC. They opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order (perhaps influenced by what guest stars they could promote) instead of the more logical production order. Several times, the program anticipated an additional half hour of dreck as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes of that were not enough)! In fact, it is a bad omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring program like this fails, while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the entire series was released on DVD and the program now has the opportunity to win a larger following. 10/10
