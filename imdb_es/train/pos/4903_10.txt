Inspired at least a little by Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, which performed during the war years at the Covent Garden Opera House, this film narrates the attempts of an elderly saxophonist to reform the (almost) all girl band with which he played As a schoolgirl towards the end of the Second World War. A few brief flashbacks to the original band on stage provide us with wonderful music and help complete the background of the band members and, in particular, the girls' relationships with the lonely male member: their transvestite drummer (who tries dodge the call). <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("The Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench become excellent main acts such as the recently widowed Elizabeth, and the connivance, womanizer Patrick, the drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as a leader of the band, who now plays the bar piano on the seashore, and June Whitfield shines as the trombone of the Salvation Army. The cameo appearances of other greats such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The film is a track of memories, with a star cast of what should be, by all rights, be a group of actresses. All I can say is that I hope you see me so well at your age. Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years of age. She certainly still has my pulse! As I watched, I was mentally reprimanding the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age. Then, I looked for these girls and discovered that they are all old enough to have been performing in the London of 1944 (although this might be a bit of an exaggeration for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like swing bands, you like nostalgia or you just want to see how well a woman can manage with almost three quarters of a century behind her, do not miss this movie. <br /> <br />
