This timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart. So many years I have waited to see this eternal story! I was not ready, maybe. It is possible that my sensitivity has not appreciated its power. So now, with gratitude, I welcome my soul with joy. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI has been long. His is now a legendary luminescence. But now I have finally discovered the valuable gifts of the splendid talents of LUISE RAINER. Oh, how many faces can talk like hers? Some have said that it came from their years of silence, and this may well have been, but his speech is eloquent enough when given an opportunity. She deserved her Oscar. <br /> <br /> This movie is in an epic in the most classic proportions. All the parts equal, necessary and perfect. Detractors can move away if they wish, but they would be avoiding a narrative that keeps a life for life. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD EARTH enriches one in a way that one does not expect. But not everything will come out of it with the joy I did. But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not tell me with mere technicalities regarding the race of the main players. These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with absolute perfection. But I dare a million new films to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with so much commotion, power, conviction and grace. <br /> <br /> If any modern artist would dare to re-film this masterpiece, I warn you that you will never approach the aromatic fragrance that still emanates from the core of this narrative. Time will not diminish this effort nor will progress improve its greatness.
