The comment of the person who said that Pat Robertson is bad and that his program is bad has nothing to compare what is bad and fair. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good! He does not even know that he fulfilled biblical prophecy! If you do not know God and you refuse to know him now, it's fine. He still loves you, but when you finally bow to Him, and you will, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone to hell, not even you! You will go there by your own decision and your expulsion will define it! May God have mercy on you and give you an experience in Damascus. The 700 Club and Pat Robertson ministry is one of the reasons why I'm still here. On the verge of alcoholism, adultery and probably death, God reached through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God he did! You have the right to say what you said, but you have no right to curse with your words. God, have mercy on you.
