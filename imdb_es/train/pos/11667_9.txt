The Secret of Kells is a movie that I've been waiting for years after having seen some pictures at Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I'm here to tell you that the wait was worth it. The cartoons are very stylized but they are not as annoying as I feared. The whole movie is a thing of beauty and great imagination, in particular I love the animated animated book where the small figures come alive on the page. The characterization is excellent, I love the voice of Brendan Gleeson as the abbot of stern and I especially liked the voice of sprite Aisling. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well made, a mixture of reality and fantasy. and it really attracts the viewer to encourage Brendan in his search for the perfect materials for the Book. Anyway, I am a lover of calligraphy and lighting, so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who have seen this and are not fanatics of the craft agree that it is a small movie lovely. I will definitely buy the DVD when it is released, and I would like to say, well done, Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this gigantic project. That they are many more. :) Returning here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and delivered them at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish you all the luck of the world at the Oscars, what a joy to see this nominee.
