This movie appeared in a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about that wonderful television series. I think this was a surprisingly good horror movie from the early '40s, with a very surprising sound and image for a 67-year-old public-domain horror movie. In fact, I liked seeing Bela Lugosi and his strange staff, including his wife, who needs fluids from the glands of future brides, an old witch, and his two strange sons, one giant idiot and the other comic dwarf (Angelo Rossitto of the monsters of 1932). I also enjoyed the young and daring journalist, which is a kind of stereotype, but it's still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent movie is its plot, even ridiculous and incredible for a movie. I do not want to spoil anything in this movie, so go rent it or, better yet, buy it for a couple of dollars.
