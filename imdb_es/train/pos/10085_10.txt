['I just watched this movie with my children (son, 10 and 4, 4.5) in the 3rd. Roger Ebert Annual Film Festival Overlooked. After the film, the children of the audience were allowed to ask questions of the Director, Tian-Ming Wu. He (through a translator) told several stories about his life and the making of the film. <br /><br /> Leaving the tangents aside, my two sons really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to paraphrase many of my daughter&#39;s subtitles, but much of the film is visually self-explanatory. <br /><br /> I will not reveal anything, but the bottom line is that this movie is MUCH better than 95% of Hollywood trash (especially children&#39;s movies). <br /><br /> Cheers. <br /><br /> pd There is a King of &quot;real&quot; / original masks who can / could make 12 masks at a time. The actor in the film trained and learned to make up to 4 masks at a time (then cut and change to 4 new masks).']
