Although this program has been off the air since 1973, after watching a DVD set that I borrowed from our library, I felt compelled to say something about it. <br /> <br /> I can remember when was the only show in color. on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there would be a small "Sunday Night Party" with friends to watch this on NBC on one of the few color televisions. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the story not so much for the names and dates, but how it influences us today and how the most inconsequential actions of the time can be so profound. One example: the city of Virginia, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world due to silver, got its name from a character called "Old Virginny", who, in the early days of the city, came out of a room. He fell and broke his bottle of whiskey. <br /> <br /> Old Virginny did not want to waste the occasion, so the precious liquid was seeping into the ground and decided to name the city "Virginia Town". The area became known as Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, had the reputation of trying to jump the call of all, and the area became known as Comstock Lode. <br /> <br /> I just watched an early episode dealing with these 2 themes. Other episodes related to the literary rise of Mark Twain, while a reporter from the Territorial Enterprise ... <br /> <br /> It was a healthy (and often educational) family entertainment. As someone else commented, each episode would actually be considered a movie in itself, with rich scripts and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that distorted the truth was the proximity to Virginia City and Ponderosa. Indeed, to travel from Ponderosa (all north of Lake Tahoe), one would have to ride his horse about 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) up the Spooner Summit to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) of the Carson Valley and then another 30-40 miles to the city of Virginia. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the Cartwrights would have some sore back tips when doing this regularly. But all writers should have a margin for maneuver with the truth. <br /> <br /> How I miss that program, even today.
