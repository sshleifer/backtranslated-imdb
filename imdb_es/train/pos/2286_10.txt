The people who produced this masterful film have rendered an excellent service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best work of fiction focused on human guilt and human responsibility ever published. Nolte takes the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., and makes it his own, being true to Vonnegut's representation of a man who has lost ALL (for and) for Love. <br /> <br /> There are no weaknesses in this Good adaptation.
