Several posters have quoted Renoir expressing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling on camera. The short answer is that we would not all do it, while the harsh reality is that only a few chosen ones can do it. At this stage of his career, Bergman could not be arrested; in 1949 he left Hollywood to take a photo in Europe, fell in love with director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but within a year, after doing this for Renoir, she returned to where she belonged and with an Oscar to kick Anastasia. This is one of the three films that Renoir made in color at this time and, in general, it is better than The Golden Coach, which is not difficult, and even with French Can Can. Renoir probably realized that with so much effort for her, Bergman could escape with a pair of leading wooden men and Renoir chose two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is really based on a real incident in French history, but Renoir is content to give it a little importance and concentrate on replicating his father's paintings once it has been created. In its pastel colors it resembles another film from the Les Grandes Manouvres era, which is not bad at all. In general, it's still a bit nice showing off a beautiful and charismatic actress.
