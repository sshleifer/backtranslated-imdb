The third and final installment of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most concrete of them all. The "training" is even completed within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's research on loan loans that are carried out by an order of blind monks. He also makes a historical comment about the proud refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where Hanzo's first film was simply a fun and bloody journey with little connection to his argument, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" manages to connect everything, and in the end he takes everything home. Definitely the perfect ending. Ah, yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there's a lot of unnecessary blood and violence (it's * Han * the Razor after all).
