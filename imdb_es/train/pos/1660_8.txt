I'm a fan of art, I like everything I like about art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This movie shows it, so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to paint something about art, especially naked bodies, but she can not do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the film she painted herself She was naked, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family did not let her paint naked men because it is against morals. Even so, Artemis could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems that the art teacher is also absolutely in love with her, so in the end he sacrifices his freedom for hers by lying. He said he raped her, but it was not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says she will suffer a lot, because in the trial in which Artemis, her father and the art teacher were, someone was hurting her artistic hands to tell the truth. I think this is a great movie about ART, and an artistic love, it's worth seeing. Valentina Cervi is great as Artemisia, she acts very well, I also like her performance in "The Portrait of a Lady" like Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
