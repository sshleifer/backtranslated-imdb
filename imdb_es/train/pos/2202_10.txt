I must have been only 11 years old when Mr. Peepers started. It was a must see for the whole family, I believe in Sun. nights Robbery repeated Rob was opening his locker (had to use a measuring stick or a pointer to measure the correct place in another locker and do other things, finally kicked the place where the door was opened) and took pins out of a new shirt (At the beginning of an episode, I opened a package with a new dress shirt and, for the rest of the program, I found one pin after another that I missed when I unwrapped the shirt, time was all and the pins laughed a lot.) I remember an aunt who drove a river like Jack Benny and always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientific. I would think and propose a "semipermeable membrane" or an osmosis that would tell you how bright it was. (You must have been there). Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on the screen. Why they did not continue the series from their point of view when Wally resigned (he feared they would pigeonhole him but by then it was too late) I'll never know. I saw somewhere that the 1st TV wedding (the biggest anyway) was Tiny Tim on the Carson show. Horsecocky. It was Rob and Nancy (if I ever had the affections for her) and I remember that she appeared on the cover of TV Guide and it was printed in all the major newspapers and magazines. A trip to the Broadcasting Museum in New York years ago was disappointing, as they had very few episodes at that time and could have left now. I still remember it as wonderful and wish I had been a little older.
