I was not a fan of watching this movie, but when my girlfriend called me and told me I had a free advanced projection pass, I went with him just to see Eva Longoria and laugh at Jason Biggs' antics. <br /> <br /> Overall it was better than I expected but not by much. This was like a hybrid of how to lose a man in 10 days and like heaven. A typical romantic comedy with its moments, I suppose. However, the film was quite short (around 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, develop the character's development and have a decent happy ending. The whole idea of ​​a ghost stalking her ex-husband was an interesting plot to follow. Eva did a good job keeping the sarcasm and Paul Rudd and the rest of the cast (especially Jason Biggs) kept the laughter at a smooth pace. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the movie just because I had a good deal of laughter to keep going, otherwise, I would have given this film a lower rating. Hey, it's a movie for girls and I'm reviewing this movie from a boy's point of view, it would be more of a fair fight if the women reviewed this movie and thought about it.
