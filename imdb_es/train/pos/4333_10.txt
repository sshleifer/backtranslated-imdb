I saw this in the preview, great movie, wonderful characterizations, witty and intelligent dialogue, the actors were fantastic, Peter Falk will be ready for an Oscar, Paul Reiser was charming, the photography was wonderful Reiser was in the theater when we saw the movie, and gave a vivid story about the making of the film; It had been a long dream to write a semi-autobiographical account of the relationships between children and parents, and more specifically between him and his father, this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining way. The fashion, cast cast was well chosen and gave the film a family feel. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an intelligent drama and wonderful performances.
