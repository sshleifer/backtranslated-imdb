One of the last classics of the French New Wave. For the director, the filmmaker Jean Eustache was inspired by the simplicity of the cinema of the early twentieth century; For the story, Eustache relied on the torments of his complicated love life. You can say so many things about this movie - observationally brilliant; I indulgently too long; occasionally hilarious emotionally exhausting ... etc. In my opinion, the complaints that can be compared to this movie are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths. Every film student, writer, or just anyone who is willing to handle a 3-hour movie without abrupt cuts, no exaggerated music video, no plot spin like a soap opera, and no banal dialogue should be a point to see this movie. Everything must be admired: writing (concise, intelligent, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone, simply, are perfect in their respective roles), and the simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer inside the movie) makes that this unforgettable movie. This is, without a doubt, a movie that stays with you.
