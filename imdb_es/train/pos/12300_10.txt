This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all the other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had so many followers in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version of the English version. It's a good story and a must for fans of Garbo.
