As a person who sought an existence as a "professional" person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and a Masters in Business Administration, my sanity always remained spasmodically in external indulgences in more artistic things. My post-graduate classes were always supported emotionally and spiritually by an interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding and artistic drawings that also included screen printing. <br /> <br /> I also stay healthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states such as Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Running, walking and hiking are close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds. <br /> <br /> In that context, I was obsessed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was also impressed by the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy, as well as the skills and smoothness of Director / Director of Photography Thomas Riedelsheimer. In fact, I could not separate Goldsworthy's art with the trajectory of Riedelsheimer's camera. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
