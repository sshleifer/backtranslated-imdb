MEN OF HONOR presents Cuba Gooding Jr., in what is probably his best performance to date. He plays Carl Brashear, a man of great courage and heroism. He is a poor farmer from the South, who wants to become a Navy diver, but he has problems because of his race. The director of the diving school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a peasant farmer who, however, grows to respect Brashear. The film is about how Brashear has to match the almost insurmountable odds, not once but twice. The performances are what make this film special. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, offers an impressive performance, his best dramatic work in years. Charlize Theron offers another solid performance as DeNiro's much younger wife. The film is based on patriotism a bit too strong (although not very close to the level it was in THE PATRIOT), and some of the characters are only one dimensionally bad (Mr. Pappy Hal Holbrook is just so bad) , but the movie is a rarity among today's movies. It is edifying and not cynical. A wonderful movie
