['This movie is definitely on the list of my 10 favorites. The voices for the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are brilliant as the daring feline and the inexperienced puppy, but the real highlight is Don Ameche as the old and faithful golden retriever. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children and adults. Funny and full of suspense, and guaranteed to make all animal lovers cry! (Tears of happiness!)']
