I like to see people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie that takes you to a disco called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas, because there is also an "MC Santa Claus". <br /> <br /> Even if it's an old movie, and even if I've recorded it on TV video, when the State Film Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on its own big screen, I went there to see it. It's much nicer on the big screen than on television. <br /> <br /> Although many people here think that seeing this on the big screen is a waste of money for the cost of the ticket, I do not agree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I got the money value to see this, since it is on the big screen, especially sitting in the front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video.
