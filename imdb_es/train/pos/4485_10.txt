['This is my favorite of the old Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons of the early 40&#39;s. The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is on the set of Tom &amp; Jerry Spotlight Collection 2, disc one, and shows the wonderful detailed animation of the first cartoons. The jokes of this are not all in the style of Avery, but more subtle and aimed at anyone who has stayed up late watching scary movies (or radio shows)! Tom is listening to a spooky radio show, and Jerry decides to play a series of tricks to scare him. The gag of nine lives is well made here, and I do not know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scared me when I was a child. When the owner of Tom wakes up with the uproar, Mom was not the maid, it was HIS house, she receives a big surprise, with a big laugh. Prepare your pause button, it&#39;s worth it!']
