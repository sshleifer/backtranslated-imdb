What a remarkable film is this that I have no words to describe. I do not know how it is that the rating of the film is 7.3 should be 9.3, but anyway no one else can make this film and Akshay's performance is exceptional. The second half of the movie makes you cry and the film really has an unexpected good ending that makes the film perfect. You should see this movie once, I think twice, it's up to you. Anyway, I love this movie and it's not only sad and funny, but it also gives you a good meaning and what you should do, so I think this is one of the best movies in the history of Bollywood. But I know that people have different options so that already. The only thing I do not like about this movie is music, the background music is good, but the songs are not good enough. I think music would be better if AR Rahman was the music director, but we can not do anything anyway. about that so already.
