I love this movie freekin! Walsh is a true master of the cinematographic form, his film sometimes, in my opinion, has been overlooked. But this movie is one of my favorites because it really gives you the feeling of the moment when the film was developed. \ <br /> <br /> All the wonderful characters that existed, the lifestyle, the way of dressing, the way they spoke, well, may be exaggerated, but it's good to know that there were times when two men tried to outdo each other with crazy acrobatics. <br /> <br /> I felt it was part of the story. wathced by many people and appreciated for this fact. <br /> <br /> Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I've only seen it on TV. But for anyone who wants a movie of life over that period of time, this is the perfect one.
