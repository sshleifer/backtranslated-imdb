Despite what others had said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I had been waiting to see it, but once I did, I immediately fell in love. Sure, it's weird, but that gives it more exciting flavor. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first films of Gackt and Hyde. They have not done much at all, maybe 3 or 4 tops each. So, give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at the beginning either. I think that they throw some strange situations there, but I see that to find the best points of this movie, the emotions shown and all that. Therefore, I have given, and I will always give, this movie a 10 out of 10.
