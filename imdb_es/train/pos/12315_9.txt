There are 21 comments since I add mine to this list and there is hardly a criticism. This is because this movie is great entertainment and has a bit of everything. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps a bit frightening for the younger children, but my 15 year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the Action, to the humor and even to the beautiful music. <br /> <br /> I buy DVDs only when I know they are going to be seen regularly and now that this is finally available in the UK, it is definitely being added to my collection.
