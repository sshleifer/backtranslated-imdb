Dirty Sanchez is the most extreme British version of Jackass in which the four children (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) do everything possible to hurt and humiliate each other. The reason why this program is better than Jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned, which makes the reaction much more fun. There are 3 series of the series, the first follows them and carefully observes their lives, for example. There is an episode about their love lives, jobs, etc. The second series sends children to try different occupations. The third continues his European tour. It seems that the boys are becoming more and more audacious as the show progresses through the series. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but trust me when I tell you, if you have a week's stomach, you DO NOT SEE, since you can see a good amount of blood and vomiting in each episode.
