['&#39;De Grot&#39; is an excellent Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, &#39;Het Gouden Ei&#39; became the great Dutch mystery thriller called &#39;Spoorloos&#39; (&#39;The Vanishing&#39;) in 1988. This is not as good as that thriller (although it is much better than the American remake as well called &#39;The Vanishing&#39;) but there are times when it comes close. <br /><br /> Especially the opening moments are phenomenal. We see a man, then we learn that his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from an airplane in Thailand. When he picks up his suitcases, it&#39;s pretty clear he&#39;s smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. It creates a kind of suspense that you would not normally have in an opening scene like this. Later, we see how Egon makes his deal in Thailand with a woman, and both claim that they have never done something like that. <br /><br /> From this point, the film is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, still as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a boy named Axel (as a child played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, more or less, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon, meanwhile, goes to college and establishes with a woman. Around this time, he sometimes meets Axel, but he really does not want to have anything to do with him. <br /><br /> The film is chronological in a certain way. It shows Egon and Axel as children, as students, young adults and in their mid-thirties. But once in a while, as I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps back. Every time we see them as children, it explains something that happens when they are adults. <br /><br /> Minor spoilers here. <br /><br /> The title means &quot;The cave&quot;, and it is the cave that gives the film its happy ending, although in reality it is not so happy. Like the beginning, the ending is tremendous. The central part of the film is entertaining and, in some way, distracts our attention from the first scenes, only to return at that point at the end. It is the edition that gives the film its happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic ending is also happy in a certain way.']
