['I really like this show. I can easily see how he achieved cult status. It is original and stimulating. However, for some reason, I never felt the kind of resonance I could have. It does not include the type of open door, the winter cold that was had from such an incredible premise. Every time I watch an episode, I find myself pressing and pressing to answer a question without a name and without form. <br /><br /> Before continuing, let me start with this by saying that what follows is my opinion and only my opinion. Different styles for different people. <br /><br /> I would have liked to have seen more scenes in &quot;American Gothic&quot; that were filmed at night. There is too much daylight in this show, and I think it had a tendency to counteract the suspense. We are not afraid of the light of day, after all. We are worried about what is in the shadows. The devil is not always in the details. What we are not seeing is often the most frightening thing. <br /><br /> Second, and this is the one that will probably lead to tar and feathers: Gary Cole is a tremendously talented actor ... a character actor. I&#39;ve followed his career since The Brady Bunch movies, so it hurts me to say that he was probably a villain like Lucas Buck. It is almost too petroichan, too nice to be the embodiment of evil, even by biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a narcotic. He is the heroine. He is at home in a kitchen lab next to a gallon of Drain-O. You keep coming back, although you know that the end will be madness and death. He must be like the last shark loan. He is a creator of books, but also of an indescribable condemnation. Of course. You have the money, and soon you will also have broken fingers; a severed hand, a decapitated head and, eventually, a condemned soul. Moving to Buck is an act of despair, and whenever it is near, there should be some immediate, environmental purpose, with interest compounded daily, in the air. <br /><br /> Everything is generosity, all the chains are united, and when you realize that, you will also know that it is too late. <br /><br /> Which brings me to three: they showed Buck too often. It is in most of the scenes, in fact, what may have made him lose the advantage. The sheriff would be like the mythology next door. He is the known apocryphon. Many would know about him, but only a few unfortunate people would really know him. It would be the subject of flashbacks and cryptic conversations, and the perfect person to make this exposition of the plot would have been the attached character that Nick Searcy played. <br /><br /> Fourth, the show could be very reverent, for a flaw, some might say, and this is characterized by the whistle of &quot;Meet Me At The Fishing Hole&quot; in the pilot of the series. I think we&#39;ve already established that what Cassidy and Raimi were shooting was the anti-Andy Taylor. We probably did not need to send the concept through Fed Ex. I picked that up in the first five minutes, so for me, the piano in my head was unnecessary. <br /><br /> These observations have to do with what, FOR ME, would have made a good show great. I also understand that the producers had their own unique style and that there were many hands on soup. In its eternal search for LCD programming, the network played a definitive role in the disappearance of this series. <br /><br /> The least that these jerk-off suits could have done was to air the episodes in order. <br /><br /> Be realistic <br /><br /> Either way, it is a great loss for fans of the genre as well as occasional spectators.']
