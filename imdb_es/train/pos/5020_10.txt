This is what a movie should be when it comes to capturing the essence of what is very surreal. It has this hazy nuance that is rarely captured in the film, it feels like a sequence of dreams and really transports you to a dark haunting memory. The children were extremely credible and I expect some things from them in the future. Very natural performance for the youngest, I do not know if Bill took them out of there or it was just good, but not less excellent. Bill noted as far as I'm concerned and from KevNJeff's comment about Mr. Paxton's poor performance, what can be done in that role. He played the role quite well in my opinion. This comes from someone who said that Hamlet was good (Ethan Hawke's version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. Great movie to make you feel really uncomfortable, if that's what you want? The cinematography gets a rating above the average too.
