That was fun! I never read those Chester-Gould comics, but you do not need to know them. Maybe there were some internal jokes that I did not understand, but what the eye does not see is that the heart can not cry. This is such an ironic and colorful film, and the actors are in a good mood all together. The setting is similar to that of the 'Batman' movies, but not as dark as gray. Well, the story is not so original, but there is a plot (which is not self-evident) and a more or less surprising ending. <br /> <br /> With this movie, you can play an interesting game, if you look at it with friends. Do not look at the credits at the beginning and then see who is the fastest to discover who the famous actors are with their makeup!
