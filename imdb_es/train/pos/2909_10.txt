I love Paul McCartney. He is, in my opinion, the greatest of all time. However, I could not pay a ticket for his concert at the Tacoma Dome during the Back in the US tour. I was upset to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as being there. Paul is still man and I will enjoy this for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. I'd like to hear all about Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Also Paul is not dead. <br /> <br /> The greatest concert DVD of all time. <br /> <br /> ** *** out of *****.
