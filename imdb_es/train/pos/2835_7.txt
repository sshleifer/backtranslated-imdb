I have to thank the Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors that I only paid US $ 1.4 and could enjoy such a surprising pleasure. <br /> <br /> Adultery? How common in our modern days. Eva grabbed her two sons and kidnapped Nick to chase Luis and Charlotte to Italy. She wants a rematch, but in the end, she also commits the same crime as Luis: she had sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this small independent production, Vivian Naefe dealt with the initial problems in modern marriage. A light heart How can one dare to treat marriage seriously in this time of fast food where people now have greater mobility in the physical, mental and technological areas? The marital commitment demands a price too high that most people would choose to succumb to the circumstances. Nick once trusted Charlotte, but fell in love with Eva after that kidnapping trip that forced him to experience great growth. <br /> <br /> Most viewers can feel happy about the end because Eva and Nick come together, well, this should be the biggest payback to the unfaithful act of their spouses. However, I want a sequel, I want to see how the four would develop after this exchange. Maybe they can exchange again, how can they be so sure of the unstable love relationship? <br /> <br /> Good acting and good scenery. The two small children actors should not be neglected, especially the child when he cries at the hotel reception in Venezia. And, of course, how can we forget the "beautiful, beautiful" landscape of the city?
