I wish I could laugh as much as when I saw this show for the first time. I have not done it since then. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that I find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show over and over again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultivated, he is touching, he is a man of the world. He is adept at talking politics and yet does not feel the need to "participate" in the political discussion. He is above that. I would compare it to George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try to convince people about his ideas, and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The funniest guy on Earth
