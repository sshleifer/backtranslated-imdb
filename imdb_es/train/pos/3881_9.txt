This movie caught me with the incredible opening sequence that tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective, so I was hooked at the time the title appeared. The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to reinvent themselves, but not in a complicated way like Identity or Usual Suspects, but in the way we all try to do the banal life in which we find ourselves in a bit plus. interesting. The scenes in the chicken stores are spectacular. At one point, Jorgen (who owns the chicken farm) attends a seminar to laugh, where he is the worst student. His discomfort at this allows him to see the depth of his longing to change himself. The movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries hidden behind the surface of the most common people I see every day. There is not much plot here. Guessing the elder's secret is easy enough, but the fascination lies in trying to guess what the other characters will do when they discover it. This movie attracted me in the same way that Sideways did, although the characters could not be more different.
