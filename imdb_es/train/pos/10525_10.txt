I have no idea how a Texan (the director, Douglas McGrath) and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow achieved this, but seeing him again will remind him of all the fuss over Mrs. Paltrow in the first place! It's been a long time since I left the woman aside and I still feel quite boring in her Oscar-winning performance "Shakespeare In Love," but she has all the rhythms right here: she's almost perfect like Emma Woodhouse. She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare, but she should be remembered for this. <br /> <br /> Of course, she is surrounded by a great support cast that includes Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson and others ... Jeremy Northam is very attractive as the love interest, even if the script is Stirs a little in your declaration of love to Paltrow (in the process, allowing all tension to drain from your relationship); Several years later, Ewan's hair is a little easier to take than in '96 and, personally, I find the presence of Alan Cumming in anything today. But the standout is, without a doubt, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; What this version needs is a scene in which Emma reconciles with Miss Bates, since she is the character whose destiny we are attracted to. It's worth seeing the movie (again, even) just for its performance. <br /> <br /> In general, this has aged beautifully with charm to save and more than enough subtlety to solve the British class system. It's worth renting (because Paltrow is unlikely to be that good again, but we'll always have Emma).
