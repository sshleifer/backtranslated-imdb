I gave this movie 8 out of 10, reserving 10 for, say, Amadeus, and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire more recently. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge in a film of this kind without understanding the life, mentality and soul of the Balkans that Kusturica presents masterfully. To understand it, you really need to be one of the Balkans. This is an amazing movie, much better and more contemporary than his previous films, which are boring at the moment, I think Kusturica is moving forward with this movie. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is an art in itself, each scene is artistic to the limit. The plot is probably a fairy tale, I do not remember now, but remember to read to my daughter who is going to sleep a similar story.
