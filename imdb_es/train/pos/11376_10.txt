This must be one of the best movies about serial killers I've seen in my life, and it comes from someone who absolutely loves the silence of the lambs. HBO has reached the jackpot here. This film is convincing from the first moment to the last. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many underlying themes that it's hard to say exactly what it is about. It narrates the search of a decade of the Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea offers a brilliantly secretive performance as the inexperienced forensic expert in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sutherland offers an even more immersive performance as his superior cynic and the only person in the Russian government who is willing to help him. Both interpretations are subtle masterpieces: Rea begins naively and does not want to compromise, while Sutherland begins detached and almost amused by the situation. Towards the end, Rea feels more tired of the world and beaten by the system, while Sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other movie, I would have said that Sutherland's performance stands out above the rest, but here he is even rivaled by Jeffrey DuMann, as the serial killer himself. DuMann brilliantly creates a character here that inspires empathy instead of the hatred we think we find: he is a monster, but he does not want to be, and we have the idea that he is so disgusted with what he does. as we are. He is tortured, ashamed, but also cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can take the incredibly dark theme (and it's * very * disturbing), then you should watch this movie.
