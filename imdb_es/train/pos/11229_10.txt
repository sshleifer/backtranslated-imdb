With the amount of actors that have working on the project, they have a wide variety of actors. Nice CGI spaceship in places BUT your green screen needs some work. Anyone who has heard about Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it and improve its handling. <br /> <br /> The stories are well thought out, there are many trek elements in this to keep it in the right context. BUT BUT the idea of ​​two guys kissing makes me go through the episode. I'm not homophobic, but I can not help finding men kissing entertaining (no matter the women). Anyway ... For a series of fans this is good. With a small improvement in its green screen, a brush performance and some guide classifications, this series is impressive. Anyway I recommend this series to those who have enjoyed TNG and DS9.
