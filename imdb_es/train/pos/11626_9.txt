This is an excellent fast-paced thriller by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), who for 85 minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying: the evil of human beings. We are much more likely to encounter the benign evil of Jackson Rippner than with Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly and even charismatic killer. The performances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, of The Wedding Crashers) are brilliant. Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is a small-scale action, not the wide sweep of the canvas, and it is no less convincing for these limitations. Cinematography is nothing special, although, of course, you can only do a lot with a camera in the confines of a passenger plane, but the dialogue is excellent, the story tense. There are no distractions, there are no secondary arguments that confuse the problem, which is in your heart a battle between the main characters. By keeping his focus and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven can take what is a minimal plot and turn it into an exciting fast-paced action thriller.
