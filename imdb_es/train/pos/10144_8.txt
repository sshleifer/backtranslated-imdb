But the fun is in the trip. <br /> <br /> I discovered that this movie is extremely nice, not only the two are extremely easy on the eyes, the humor of the support cast and the jokes actually made me laugh. strong several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliche romantic comedy. But the point is that it is a sweet story, the message about finding your only true love also sounds true in many ways. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is active and the performance is well done everywhere, and at the top for the comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth its weight in gold, the actress there deserves an honorable mention! For those who criticized him for being predictable: if you want a movie with twists and turns that keeps you guessing ... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy ... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky to find my true love in life, and it has been worth all the efforts along the way. <br /> <br /> Great Movie Quote, great movie for a happy scream ...
