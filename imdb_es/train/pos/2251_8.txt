['It seems to me that Alan Jacobs&#39; review is very accurate with respect to the film; however, I had the opportunity to rent the Blockbuster DVD with a comment from the BYU curator, Motion Picture Archives James D&#39;Arc. The then Hebrew Prophet J. Grant, SUD, approved that the film should include deviations from historical content for dramatic expressions and telescopic events. For example, the movie showed Joseph Smith in court. despite the great oratory of Brigham Young in defense of Joseph Smith, he was condemned anyway. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith was never convicted of anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when they arrested Joseph Smith for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed before the trial.']
