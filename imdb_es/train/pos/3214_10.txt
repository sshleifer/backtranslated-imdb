I fell in love with this silent action drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played this so well. Raised from childhood to know nothing but war and struggle, Todd (Kurt Russell) is abandoned on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers. <br /> <br /> The stage is ready and another classic icon of the action movies was born - SOLDIER. No Rambo, no Schwarzenegger, no Bruce Willis, no Mel Gibson, no Jason Statham; Kurt Russell is the owner of this role and made it completely his own: original, daring and too human. I miss the fact that sequels were never made. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com / ny5 / jbc33 /
