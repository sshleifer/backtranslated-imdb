['My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, I really expected a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? Was! But this movie had so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could enjoy. I know this was a very cheesy movie, but Uma and Anna were great and Steve was a great addition along with a great cast who seemed to have a lot of fun and that was what made the film really work. <br /><br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, that&#39;s the real name of my best friend) is not your typical average librarian, when Matt, your average man, invites her out, has more than he expected, asked G-Girl for an appointment, The superhero of the world! But when she finds out what a jealous and crazy girl really is and decides that it may be a good idea for them to spend some time apart, but Jenny will not have it since she has fallen in love with another girl, Hannah, and she will make Her life Hell, I mean, let&#39;s face it, he could not have chosen a better girl to break up with her. <br /><br /> The effect was cheesy, but you seriously overcame them quickly, the story and the cast made the story really work and I loved Uma in this movie, it was a big step forward for Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie that you should not take seriously, it&#39;s just a nice romantic comedy that I think if I could laugh at it, anyone could do it. <br /><br /> 7/10']
