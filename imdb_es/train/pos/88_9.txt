This was one of the best movies I've seen. The film is related to real life and how drugs can play an important role. Although this movie seems to be produced from a low budget, I found it exciting to watch it. <br /> <br /> It is possible that some do not like the story and say that the script lacks direction. However, when a person gets as deeply into drugs as these characters, there is no direction in life. I feel that this film is an accurate representation of what could happen to a person if faced with extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> The majority of the cast is a newcomer to the industry. However, everyone did it very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and adopt the appropriate character. <br /> <br /> I think this movie could be a good tool to use when it comes to a person or a loved one who is involved in drugs and seems to be spiraling. out of control. This movie could scare them enough to change their ways.
