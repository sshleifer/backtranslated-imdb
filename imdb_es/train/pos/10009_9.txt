The first time I read the story of Armistead Maupins, I was surprised by the human drama shown by Gabriel Nadie and those he cares about and loves. That being said, we have now been given the cinematic version of an excellent story and we are expected to see beyond the gloss of Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have really had success! <br /> <br /> With the right amount of moderation, Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and allows us to see his struggle with the problems of trust both in his personal life (Jess) and in the world around him ( Donna). <br /> <br /> When we introduce ourselves to the players in this drama, we remember that nothing is what it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young man becomes a life-changing event and helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to move forward. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that most people avoid this movie. . I'm just saying it because the average American will probably think "Robin Williams in a serious role? That did not work before!" PLEASE GIVE THIS VIDEO AN OPPORTUNITY! Robin Williams touches the darkness that we all must find and cross in ourselves to be better people. As in his movie One Hour Photo, he has become an actor and made another quality work of art. <br /> <br /> Oh, and before I forget, I think Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he's in. The protagonist of the 1940s is seen and present on screen. It is this opinion of the hackers that you could carry your own movie right now. <br /> <br /> S ~
