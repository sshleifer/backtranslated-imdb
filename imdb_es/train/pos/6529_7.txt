I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11 year old girl and b) we showed her Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she enjoyed a lot. Personally, I did not think it was as funny as the movies of the 1930s, but on the other hand, it was not the nauseating bit of fluff insulting the intelligence I feared it was. It was a harmless film, slightly entertaining. Although I am pleased that they have not tried to "update" Nancy to the "fashion" of the 21st century (Veronica Mars has the title of modern Nancy Drew), I think they made it a bit too bland, that they did not. Do not do enough to develop Nancy Drew: the movie could have been titled "Jane Doe, Girl Detective". I have to blame the script: I think that each actor did a good job with what I had to work on. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a script made for TV, not theatrical, script ...
