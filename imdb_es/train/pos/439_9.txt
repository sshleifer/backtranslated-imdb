The true measure of any fiction work is whether the characters grow or not from their experiences and emerge from the altered experience in some significant way (keep in mind that this change does not have to be positive or beneficial) in the end. <br /> <br /> By that measure, April enchanted is a resounding success. As a film in general, it succeeds quite well, excellent cast, well-developed characters that interest you, wonderful script and beautiful settings and locations. In summary the film is, well, lovely. Although all the performances are first class, there are three to mention: Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. It says something when Miranda Richardson does her excellent regular work and, nevertheless, is eclipsed by so many others in the cast. Highly recommended, especially if you are a romantic at heart.
