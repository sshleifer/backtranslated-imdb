This is the best Chinese movie I've seen and, in my opinion, much better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: it is a beautiful love story, an action movie, a comedy and a horror at the same time. And the most surprising thing is that he really succeeds in all this! <br /> <br /> This movie definitely reaches my top 5, and should be fun for all movie lovers. The action sequences have the traditional unrealistic jump and even flight, but the way it shoots differs a lot from the Hero's style and the flight always looks great and usually even makes sense (ghosts can fly) < br /> <br /> Watch this movie, you will not regret it. 10/10
