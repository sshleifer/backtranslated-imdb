It is not a brilliant idea to see Hundstage if you are not 100% sure of your mental stability, since this film will be subjected to severe tests, no matter how much string you are. I have to say that Hundstage is an art film instead of an entertainment movie, so most viewers would not have the level of "maturity" to reach their charming side. Something like Tarkovsky's films, but different in a certain way. I can not say that I had a lot of fun watching it. But it is an extraordinary and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the clich√© that Hollywood offers. Hundstage sticks a finger directly into your brain and scratches your mind everywhere. You can not just sit and watch it, you'll be using exclamations or looking wide-eyed throughout the movie. A movie that is similar to this one in style is Nachtgestalten, but it was considerably better and much less violent. This, for example, is not for children or for those who are mentally tender or in a bad mood. Most viewers would probably give a 10 or a 1 to this movie. I give it a 9 because I've seen the phenomenon of several stories in a movie in another movie and it was better. But this is an exceptional piece by itself. It's worth looking, but be prepared to see something disturbing.
