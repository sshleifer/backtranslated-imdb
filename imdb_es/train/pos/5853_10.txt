I really liked this Summerslam because of the appearance of the sand, the curtains and the overall appearance that interested me for some reason. Anyway, this could have been one of the best Summerslam in history if WWF did not have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now it's time to be a big fat man against a strong man, but I'm glad. the time has changed. It was a terrible main event just like every game in Luger is terrible. Other games on the card were Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening, this was the event where Shawn named his great bodyguard monster Diesel, IRS vs. 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart First take Doink then take Jerry Lawler and things with the Harts and Lawler was always very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka faced Bam Bam Bigelow and The Headshrinkers, and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger, this game was boring and has a terrible ending. However, it deserves 8/10
