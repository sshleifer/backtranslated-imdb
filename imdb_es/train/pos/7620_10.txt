Lost is the best television series out there. First of all, it has GREAT actors and a wonderful direction. Writing is a very controversial topic because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary, but after season 3 the writing became very complex. For example, who is Jacob? Why are there polar bears on the island? What is the fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people think that writers are lost and have raised many questions and mysteries. that they can not explain. I think these people are wrong. I trust writers. I think that if the mysteries are revealed from now on, all the charm of the series will disappear. Anyway, losing is undoubtedly the best television series. and will continue to be for a long time.
