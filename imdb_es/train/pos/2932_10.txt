I've seen my fair share of comedy and standing films, but this is so original, so fresh, it will make you wonder why you always walked and pass it in the video store. Murphy has some pretty obscene jokes, but this is too fun to pass. If only each movie could be so fun. It should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy" Murphy is a comical genius in this movie and will make you say "this is the guy that Dr. Doulittle made!" Talk about the man with the ice cream, the mothers who throw shoes, his aunt with a mustache, racism and everything you can imagine and those who could not. Please, if you ever see a comedy in your life, that's right, if only all the movies could be Delirious.
