I was lucky enough to see this film many years ago in England. I've seen hundreds of movies since then, but I've never forgotten this one. Although Sinatra was playing a not very endearing character, he was excellent on paper. Many people seem to think that they did not really come on the scene. his to his role in "From Here To Eternity" but, in my opinion, it was great in Concho. The other role that comes to mind is that of William Conrad. I had never seen or heard of him before this movie. Conrad plays an excellent role in this movie. I remember his deep, harsh voice and he uses it wonderfully to highlight the few words he speaks with a threat that sets the tone of his character. I also remember the music, which he presents to Conrad and he seems to surround him every time he appears. An excellent movie and my only disappointment was that I never had the opportunity to see her again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I see in the titles that the film is black and white, but when I saw that it was in full color, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt.
