['I totally agree that &quot;Nothing&quot; is a fantastic movie! I have not laughed so much when I watch a movie for years! And David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic at this! They really work well together! It is possible that this film is not attractive to some people (I can not say why without spoiling it!) But each one is its own! I loved it and I highly recommend it! <br /><br /> The direction is great and some of the shots are very smart. It seems like they had a lot of fun filming it! <br /><br /> Although in reality there are only 2 main characters in the film and not many accessories, the actors manage to make it and make the movie enjoyable to watch.']
