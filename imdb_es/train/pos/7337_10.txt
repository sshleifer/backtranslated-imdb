Good story and excellent animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious, and that's a good thing. Anyone who enjoys Conan the Barbarian or the Dungeons and Dragons game should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is clear, although it may seem that sometimes our hero is neutral. Most of the time, in fantasy movies, Elves are often portrayed as having fair skin and blonde hair, and elves and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone who is familiar with the work of Frazetta, Bakshi or even Tolkien knows that he is not racist. Anyone who enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie. It is not for small children due to violence and sexual innuendos. The casting was well done and the scenes and music are first class. I hope someone puts this gem on DVD soon. I consider myself fortunate to have a VHS copy in good condition.
