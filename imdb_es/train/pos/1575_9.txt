Van trotta rosenstrasse is the best movie I've seen in years. Actually, I'm not really interested in movies with historical backgrounds, but with this, my interest for that time gained! <br /> <br /> The only annoying thing about the movie were the scenes in New York, and the impression is that I had to "try to be as American as possible" ... which I think has absolutely failed. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the back really got to my heart. The German actress Katie Riemann deserved her prize completely. She is one of the most impressive actresses I have seen in my life. In the future I will see more of his films. very lucky for me because I am a native German speaking =) and only for a year in the United States, so as soon as I return I will buy some Riemann DVDs again. <br /> <br /> So everyone out there who has not seen this movie yet: LOOK AT IT !!! I think it would be too long to describe what this is all about, especially all the flash backs and switches of the times are hard to explain, but just watcxh, you'll be sneaky !!!!!!!
