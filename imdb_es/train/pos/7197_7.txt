There have been several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, eg. Alain Delon This role has also been played by prominent actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me the best of all time has always been Reed Hadley. This series gives you the opportunity to see an interesting west, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at the end. The series also has a good interpretation of several actors of films B like Ed Cobb, the ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, the eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a very good interpretation of Hadley like Zorro. He was quick, intelligent, he used his whip and sword well, and his voice was the best for any Fox.
