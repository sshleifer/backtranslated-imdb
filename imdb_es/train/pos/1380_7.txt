This type of films about young adolescents who struggle with their own sexuality were something unique and daring and daring a couple of years ago, but more and more movies like this were made in recent years, which makes it difficult for movies to really stand out. . <br /> <br /> This film also received little publicity, apart from the small film festivals that presented this little French film, as well as the big festivals that are always fans of this kind of small films on everyday topics that are not they drive too often in movies. The film premiered at Cannes in 2007 and also won some awards there. <br /> <br /> The film does not differ from the others, since in fact it presents few novelties once you have already seen some similar films. like this, but this, however, does not really mean that "Naissance des pieuvres" is a bad thing to see. The film is certainly a good watch, which manages its theme well and tells its story constantly and, therefore, also effectively, in a slow cinematic French rhythm. <br /> <br /> It is a coming of age film, which focuses on the life of mainly 3 totally different teenagers. Sexuality is a great theme within the film, which is handled with delicacy and subtlety. It makes the film and its history in general quite realistic, although perhaps a little predictable, since the film does not offer anything original enough within its genre. <br /> <br /> This type of French film will probably scare many people because of the reason they probably expect it to be very artistic, with deep layers and meanings. However, "Naissance des pieuvres" is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really do not have to be in Euro-teen films to appreciate this movie. It is a kind of sweet film and something sensual, due to its theme and visual approach. <br /> <br /> The film is also being realistic on the part of its actors, who do not have and have much experience in the film business but are authentic looking and feeling within their roles. The strong individual characters provide the film with some nice themes and good times. <br /> <br /> A good movie about its subject. <br /> <br /> 7/10
