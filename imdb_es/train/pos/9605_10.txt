Well, I was not sure what the movie would be like, since I had only seen a small clip, but I was thinking it was going to be good and it was right, I saw it twice the day I got it and well, it's my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan played the role of beth really well, she is a very grateful actress and the writer must have investigated a lot about bulimia, although the end is when beth is in the hospital I have 2 observations of Horus after meals because I was told that 1 house is fine and hospitals do not help the bulimics as I have been told, so I probably still be at home, although my sister and my mother would like to be hospitalized as to have bulimia, but this is a powerful movie. I recommend it to anyone with or without an eating disorder or for people who know someone with eating disorders, because it allows them to enter the life of a bulimic. Person and see the world how they do a little about a great movie and I recommend it to anyone and any type. of person
