In the process of trying to establish public empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), the filmmakers slander the North and the Jayhawkers. Missouri never withdrew from the Union and the Union Army was not an invading force. The Southerners fought for the rights of the State: the right to own slaves, to elect twisted judges and legislatures, and to employ a system of political booty. There is nothing noble in that. The Missourians could easily have traveled east and joined the Confederate Army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that history has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves the Bushwhackers, it is not because he has seen an error in his path, he certainly does not surrender to the virtue of the cause of abolition.
