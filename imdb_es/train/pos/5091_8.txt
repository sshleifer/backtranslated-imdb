['I looked at both parts twice. I enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very credible as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly surpassed Richard Chamberlain&#39;s performance. I admit that I would have preferred to see another person as the &quot;Lady in Trouble.&quot; Alison Doody should stay with modern pieces and not vintage. She did not look like the woman of the nineteenth century. The rest of the cast was excellent and followed the arguments very well. I&#39;m glad to see that actors of this generation are not afraid to try different characters and are not afraid to be seen as they get older. Age is inevitable, but do not hide from it. A man of 50 years or more can be much sexier (and Patrick really is sexy) than a green young man, no matter how nice it is. Hoorah so that the character lines accompany a great smile.']
