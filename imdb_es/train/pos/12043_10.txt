... On stage, on television or in a book, "The Woman in Black" is an exceptional ghost story. Other reviews have already said everything there is to say about this movie, but I thought I would also add my little late review. The film made for television has a deliberately slow first act, which narrates the main character of Arthur while he deals with his business as a lawyer in the 1920s in London. I can understand why this may not be attractive to all palates. However, for me, I love this British style of storytelling similar to any of the BBC's "Ghost Story for Christmas" adaptations of R.R.'s great work. James. In the second act, the ghost story begins when Arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss, to put in order the affairs of a deceased client. The third act unfolds relentlessly until it reaches a chilling conclusion ... As a Londoner, I have seen the play. I own the book, DVD-R and I also have the audio book on my iPod. What is certain for me, 'The Women in Black' in any medium is a ghost story with few equals. It is time for us to have a legitimate launch of the region 2 DVD.
