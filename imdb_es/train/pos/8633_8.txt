Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A teller in a bank, they all walk on him. Then his friend, a writer who does not like books, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss that he is resigning. He intends to spend the rest of his life making lots of money and sleeping with many women. And he manages to do just that. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the amount of deaths (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the movie, this would be a sham. There are numerous blows to marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a nice amoral rogue. Romy Schneider is at his most attractive. Definitely worth checking out.
