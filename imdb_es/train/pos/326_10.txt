"Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" is very funny. As at least another critic, I often laughed out loud. Yellow is energetic, playful, aware of himself, explorer. Do not wait for Bergman here. This film is about a young man from the early to mid-60s in Sweden and about the problems, read * contradictions *, that the nation and the world were facing. At times, Yellow seems to be a serious political-social documentary, with Lena, the main character, and other people who interview ordinary people and politicians (for example, Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this type of documentary. Meanwhile, Yellow acts as a personal documentary that explores Lena's life, her home life, her loves, her political opinions, her vision of herself. She is a complete person ?? Complex, defective, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And above all this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his team, documenting themselves documenting Lena. This is what, for me, really gives yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear in some very funny and somewhat amusing moments, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but that their presence is another layer of the film; They are filming themselves filming themselves. Does it remind me of a Bjork music video with the same quality? a music video about the making of a music video, infinite, with each iteration increasingly strange and more caricatured. I think Sjöman may have had something similar in mind. While "Jag är nyfiken? Yellow" is not a cup of tea for everyone, it is certainly smart, witty, refreshing, exuberant and authentic.
