I will not go into too much detail about the plot of this film, since other critics have covered practically the same terrain. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the movie a lot. Peter Falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> A small-scale film of 'road trip' with Falk and Paul Reiser in New York State in the fall is the scene of most of the action in the film. <br /> <br /> Very well written with an adult target audience in mind. A lot of humor based on reality and some well-performed dramas give the movie the feeling that it could be your own family. <br /> <br /> I really can not say enough about this movie, except that it's a shame that a lovely movie like that there is no more exposure, while other trashy trash out there. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Falk with a big lead man role again and he takes full advantage of it. It shows that his famous friend and writer / director John Casavettes was right in choosing Falk in many of his groundbreaking films of the 60s and 70s.
