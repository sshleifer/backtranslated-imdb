I have seen several comments here about Brando using a southern accent, some of which he felt was a mistake. When this film was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South. The laws of Jim Crow were still valid. Civil rights were in their infancy. Could this possibly have been a subtle social commentary, a southern man in love with a woman of another race? In the same way that MASH was a subtle criticism of the Vietnam War? Any ideas? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made that Myoshi Umeki seems "cold". Anyone who has been in Japan will understand. The Japanese, at least in my experience, did not tend to show emotion in front of strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who knew single women. The Americans in Japan were totally oblivious to this culture, and the overwhelming attempts to meet women were shocking to women. One of the traits of the Japanese was to smile when they were embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many US military took as a sign that their advances were welcome. Also remember that at the time represented in the film, Japan had just been defeated, and occupation forces were treated with reluctant acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible performance of what his situation would have been. Seeing his interaction with the American actors brought me several memories of my own experiences in the country. I met a couple of beautiful young women who, after convincing them that I was not the typical American man, taught me their language and culture during my stay in their country.
