George Raft as Steve Brodie, the carefree dance player who can never refuse to challenge himself, faces Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery), heavy and sentimental. "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, with kittens!) And the helpless Lucy Calhoun, an innocent from out of town with ambitions to become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this culture dominated by men, communication takes place mainly in the form of violence (one sees why THE BOWERY is a favorite of Martin Scorsese). Cigarettes that explode provide a current gag. "Swipes" enjoys throwing stones through windows in Chinatown, on one occasion setting fire to a laundry. (The simultaneous arrival of Brodie and Beery's volunteer fire companies leads to a fight, during which the building burns to the ground). Beery, coincidentally, exhausts a troublesome girl and hits anyone who disagrees with him, including Brodie, whom he defeats a night fight on a moored barge, to regain control of his living room, lost in a bet that Brodie I would not have the courage to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie makes the jump, but only because a subterfuge with a mannequin fails at the last moment). <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the frame with details, illustrating with pleasure the daily life of the loin; Waiting singers, stalkers waiters, whores from Suicide Hall were pushed to the Black Maria, tailors hanged the unhappy people from the street and forced them to buy suits they did not want. A small but admirable small film.
