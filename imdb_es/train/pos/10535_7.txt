the only word that sums up this movie is peculiar. It is a joyful romp through an existential concept. inflatable (in more ways than one) and a bit crazy. I would not exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema, and it does not seem as memorable to me as the first "cube" of the director's movie, but it's a good haven to watch a Sunday morning. The performance deviates from the respectable to the annoying at times, but I think that's how it was written. Made like a serious movie, it could have been great or very well to have entered into a state of pretension. A bit like "the matrix" meets "head" and "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
