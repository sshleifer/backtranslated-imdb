That's why I love this website! I saw this movie in the 1980s on British television. Over the years, I've wanted to know more, as it has remained one of the most extraordinary things I've seen in my life. With just a few key words to remember it, I traced the movie here, and a lot of information, including the fact that it's about to become an off-Broadway musical. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike the previous comment creator, I do not remember having found this movie sad, or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter remained in the mind as a testimony of great strength, honor and dignity. It is ironic that you think, considering the misery of their lives. Maybe it's because I live in Britain, where declining greatness has a language established in the lives of ancient money, where misery is often tolerated as evidence of good reproduction; I saw him as a rare and unique portrait of a huge spirit, a deep and deep humor, whose absolutely fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave him balance and respect. In a way I regretted that it was discussed as a 'cult'. Over the years, as it faded in my mind, it shone above all as an exceptional and exceptional television experience. It was an exhibition so deeply private that it seems strange to think that it becomes something as public as in a New York musical. But maybe somewhere, the daughter will have fun with such a result. It's her who will have the last laugh, maybe ... (They did a musical before you, Jackie O ')
