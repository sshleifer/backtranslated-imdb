Seeing this initial work from DeMille, I was once again reinforced that DeMille's principle is far superior to DeMille's end. His attention to the use of light within scenes is remarkable. Its rhythm is very good, which allows you to count a lot in the space of about an hour. It's a shame he was not as intuitive with the style of his latest sound films as he seemed in his silent films. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie in which I saw Cleo Ridgely. It was remarkable, quite reserved and, nevertheless, it transmitted a wide spectrum of emotions. <br /> <br /> The ending is wonderful.
