Halloween is one of those movies that puts you deeper! It is in my opinion, the most terrifying movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman of all time! It was so scary! What makes Halloween so special is that there were no special effects in which you can know what computer animation is like, this was on a low budget and it got a note of a note, but it managed to scare people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in 78. <br /> <br /> It is a boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 years and many years later he escapes from the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is behind him and will do anything to get him back, since he describes Michael as "... pure evil, the blackest eyes, the eyes of the devil". However, Michael is on a mission, to kill his other sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to take care of the children on Halloween, while her friends go out and, of course, we know the rules, they have them! But Laurie can have an opportunity since she is the virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween pays many tributes to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, the daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolutely fantastic movie that breaks the boundaries and makes you close the doors, close the windows and turn off the lights! "They'll catch you! They'll catch you!" Halloween, the latest horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
