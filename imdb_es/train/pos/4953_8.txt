['With just seventy-two minutes, this little 2006 comedy drama is really a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations. The story, which unfolds almost in its entirety at several non-descriptive points in South Los Angeles, is inconsequential, but like &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; by Sofia Coppola, the film is much more about two strangers who find themselves unexpectedly , they find a common bond and they go back to their enlightened lives for the transcendental encounter. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters. Finally freed from the wise sages and irreproachable authority figures who have become his specialty on the big screen, Freeman seems relatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star. Your character is driven to a low-cost grocery store in Carson, where you can research the role you&#39;re considering in an independent film. <br /><br /> Out of work for a few years, he feels embarrassed when he watches DVDs of his films in the bargain box, but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to see and even imitate the enervated staff of the store. Of particular fascination for him is Scarlet, a bitter worker from Spain and relegated to the line expresses where she is the model of efficiency not recognized. She has an interview for a secretarial job in a construction company, but her deep insecurity seems to overcome her chances now. Still resembling Penelope Cruz&#39;s Amazon sister, the beautiful Vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of the execrable &quot;Spanglish&quot; by James L. Brooks) offers a sharp edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. She and Freeman interact very well throughout history, which includes stops not only at the supermarket but also at Target, Arby&#39;s and a full-service car wash. Nothing happens that breaks the earth, except to show how two people realize the transient resonance of casual encounters. <br /><br /> Silberling keeps the process simple, but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in the vibrant cinematography of Phedon Papamichael (played &quot;Sideways&quot; by Alexander Payne) and the contagious music of Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto (&quot;City of God&quot;). There are fast cameos from Bobby Cannavale (like Scarlet, who will soon be her first husband) and like themselves, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, as well as some funny snippets with Jonah Hill (&quot;Knocked Up&quot;) as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons (the &quot;gentleman&quot; in &quot;Garden State&quot;) as a worship receptionist. The 2007 DVD is packed with extras, including a production documentary, &quot;15 days or less,&quot; aimed at film students and running a 103-minute marathon; six extended scenes; a three-way conversation between Silberling, Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target; and a couple of fragments that specifically advertise the DVD.']
