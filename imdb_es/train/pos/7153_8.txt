['My wife is a teacher and is very familiar with the story, having read it in several of her classes. However, it never sounded so interesting to me, and I bought the DVD thinking that this would be a movie that would not really be in my alley. <br /><br /> The first half of the movie has a lot of configuration and I found myself thinking I was right. It starts a little slow and I have to admit that I was a little bored, but curious enough to continue with that. Wow, I&#39;m glad I did it because it ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie. I would certainly see this again! <br /><br /> The casting was very good. Since I have not read the book, I can not guarantee the accuracy, but I must say that Jon Voight was really charming. You liked the characters you were supposed to like, you hated those you were supposed to hate, and you laughed at those who were supposed to be funny. <br /><br /> I can see how some people do not like this movie. It&#39;s tedious at times, especially at the beginning. All flashbacks can distract (although they are essential for the story). However, once the story begins to gather at the end, I think you have been given back the swords for your patience. When all is said and done, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10. <br /><br />']
