Actually, I think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a really bad movie. In fact, the film is very well made in many aspects and it is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit complicated, but that is the genre. The film has a noble atmosphere centered around a fatal woman. Like all the old classics of noir, this also has a script that twists you so you do not always know how to understand it at the beginning, and it can be an exaggeration if you think too much and try to understand it. Put all the pieces together. That is the genre. In general, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the spectator guessing and, in turn, surprised, without leaving the spectator. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is that it looks very good and speaks its dialogue loaded with double meaning in such a way that it becomes mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> The address is more than acceptable, because let's be honest. is - you have to keep an audience interested in the "she or she does not?" Ask for two hours. In addition to a twisted script and a funny interpretation of Stone, this is done effectively through the direction by creating a nude environment that is both dark and very austere and modern, with straight industrial lines that combine with the of Stone. sexy curves The frame is always beautiful: press pause anywhere and there is something interesting for the eye. <br /> <br /> The film is also based effectively on things that were tricks in the first movie and makes them something a little more real. , particularly sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" Here it is treated more practically, and normally, the sexuality of the film is used for a better effect. It is still exciting, but it is not as easily done for the shock value and the buzz as it was in the first. I will not say that it is not yet a trick because, let's face it, this movie is supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> And it's a fun movie. It can be an easy target, but if you look at it for what it is: a silly noirish, femme-fatale, twisty, sexy, did-or-she-don't-she-dunnit, you're bound to enjoy it (without game of words).
