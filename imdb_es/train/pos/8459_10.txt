I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really something else. The Gundam wing lacks all that stereotyped melodrama that you could think about when you think about anime, since the amount of jokes made during the 17 hours would only be two digits, Gundam Wing gets down to work. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is both a political thriller and an action series. Large parts focus on the diplomatic deals of a war, not just battles. Although the animation of the battle lacks extreme details in cases where it would only be a pain to animate, the individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art, considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, this episode 49 plus a series of films was picked up by the cartoon network in 2000, and then he was professionally nicknamed by them. The dubbing is simply impeccable. Not only do all the words that are said coincide, but the voices that are actually used make the characters much more credible. Many believe that it is better to watch anime with subs in English, but I simply do not have the determination to do so. <br /> <br /> Not only are the voices good, but the score used in the series is quite impressive. I'll just say that he left me surfing the net in vain to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what really hooks the viewers, and no, it will not hook you up like a first-time drama like Lost, which was only made for the purpose of hooking you up. The deep explanation of the plot would lead to many spoilers, since many of the characters do not even have names until a few episodes in the series. The rough idea of ​​the series is that the land and its now independent space colonies have difficulties in keeping the peace. Thus begins a war, which leads to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations. I feel that any additional detail would begin to reveal information, which is crucial to the plot. <br /> <br /> I'll finish here by saying that this series is great for anyone who likes anime, anyone who thinks that ALL the anime is stupid (they have good reasons to think so), and anyone who wants to enter the anime. A serious tone for it.
