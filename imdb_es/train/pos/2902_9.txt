I feel in movies like "Tiempo de valientes" and I want to talk about movies for hours. The admiration that this film caused me is beyond my limits of explanation, because I am watching the scenes of the film and I am looking for in my thoughts ideas for making films and dialogue innovations that could arise from something bigger than the mind of Damian Szifron . Br /> <br /> Looking at the environment, so uncompromising, so simple, I'm thinking; This man is a genius. It is not surprising that he created what is probably the best television show that has ever been seen in Argentina, and then a first film full of elements that some contemporary directors have not yet achieved. "The bottom of the sea" is the name and, woke up (a few years ago), my enthusiasm for our daily cinema. <br /> <br /> Starting your journey from the real life of the people, Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero never goes. Could in "The Bonaerense"; The life of the Federal Police Department. The Trapero movie was a trip to the mind and experiences of a man, not to the places he saw. Yes, there was a detailed training and many criminal situations, but Szifron is "there", it is more a detective story, like the ones we know and love, with the mysteries and the exciting music. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of humanity in his writings, and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters, Alfredo DÃ­az and Mariano Silverstein. There are many actors of great caliber in the film, but these two actors are those who can not do without the film. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective who has just discovered that his wife is cheating on him; and he has to work on a case. <br /> <br /> The second is a psychiatrist who is assigned the detective's treatment. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions, but the sheriff takes advantage of the time and suggests that he join Diaz in his routines: "It's nothing, the usual, there's no problem." But it is bigger than that, and it will display a part of the personality of the doctor that I did not know. <br /> <br /> The relationship developed between the two drivers can not be explained unless it is observed, because it considers such a complexity that shows how talented some men like Szifron are trying, today, to leave a signature in our history . Reaching points of incredible spontaneity, during a high-pressure situation, Diaz tells Silverstein: "How do we continue with our treatment?" And Silverstein replies: "No, I'm not your doctor, you call me for dinner, your friend" : we laugh because we can not help it. <br /> <br /> And we can not help laughing when Diaz crashes a car on the street and does not care, or when he enters. all the red lights on the street, or when he smokes marijuana in his police patrol and Silverstein can not believe it (but then he also smokes it because he's fucked up); or when Silverstein tries to be friends with Diaz's thieving friends. Diego Peretti's magic is what we received there. He, a psychiatrist in himself, gives a performance in the "Locas de amor" plan, but impresses with all its range. Luis Luque, on the other hand, is back on the road with a first class representation that reminds us of the great actor he is. <br /> <br /> There is a passion I have for this, and as I said, I could write about this for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way it works and I have to be precise and summarize. Although I have to watch many of the old movies and study them, I can assure you that "Tiempo de valientes" is the comedy that Argentina had been waiting for and that never arrived until now.
