What we have here is a situation. It is found that a man is in danger and people want to help him, in contrasting ways. In the end they are forced to let it go. You can not fix people. And although in several aspects Reign Over Me is conventionally Hollywood, that message is not. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane that has entered an almost psychotic state of PTSS since. This is what Charlie's meeting with Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who was his roommate in dental school and, knowing his tragedy, he discovers in the street and turns to connect. Charlie travels on a small motorized toy scooter, a rather capricious contraption to negotiate Manhattan traffic, with large headphones on a mass of unruly hair. The hair is the main support of Sandler to show that he is upset. And the use of music as an escape must affect all subway users who own an iPod. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a mess, but, paradoxically, Alan, stuck with a controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to envy him Charlie lives like a crazy child with a huge trust fund (insurance money) of the tragedy), and begins to drag Alan to "hang out", "eat Chinese", buy records or watch a Mel Brooks marathon in a house of representatives. Charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by an average owner, remakes the kitchen again and again, collects old vinyl from Springsteen, The Who, etc., and plays a video game called Shadow of the Collosus on a giant screen in a large empty. living room. <br /> <br /> Charlie's in-laws are deeply concerned about him, but also somewhat resentful, as we will see later. Alan has a new patient who is proposing it. Charlie's despair makes us see Alan. Trying to help Charlie partly allows Alan to escape from his own suffocating realities, but in part it only makes him more aware of them. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler make a strange couple, but that does not matter, because it is convincing that they could both need each other. Charlie is desperate for the company of a friend who never knew his family, because to escape his loss, he pretends he never had one. And what if as a roommate Charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had a terrible musical taste (without Motown)? Alan wants to escape from his orderly and fascinating life. He is under the thumb not only of his wife but of his dental colleagues, who dominate him, although he is the one who established the practice. They are white, by the way, and he is black. <br /> <br /> There is also the lascivious patient from hell, who seriously interrupts things in dental offices, but starts to look different when Charlie comes and realizes that she is a baby. Your libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any time. She is also attracted to the breasts of Liv Tyler, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who start treating Charlie when he admits he might need help. <br /> <br /> Sandler's crazy scenes are a bit too theatrical, as are many of the plot devices (in fact, this movie feels like a play at more than one point), but He has several monologues in which he expresses his pain in ways that are profoundly moving. <br /> <br /> Charlie's not only delirious and sad, but also dangerous and violent, and all these efforts to help him start counterattacking. The film is admirable because of the way it conveys the feeling that people can not be right. This is an interesting, sometimes moving film, and it is the first time it is on September 11 in terms of the suffering of survivors. But there is an element of comedy that sometimes seems insipid, many of the people are too drawn, and the too big interiors of Hollywood have a frightful decoration; Only the streets of Manhattan seem real. There is a court scene that is absurd, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who is too good to be true. Alan's family problem is solved too easily with a phone call. And yet, it's worth watching the performance: the control and subtlety of Cheadle, and Sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in P.T. Anderson's 2002 Punch-Drunk Love, although it's clearly a better movie, in fact it's much better.
