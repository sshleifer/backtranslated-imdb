I just bought the DVD and I must say that (after seeing Brazil and fearing a hatred in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. Besides being a fan of Monty Python movies, the genius of Terry Gilliam follows him in this sci-fi thriller, in which Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole, and also (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt, who interpreted the madness of Jefferey Goines. A must have it for sci-fi fans or fans of movies of any kind, as it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. <br /> <br /> in any way the plot, in the future, 1% of the world population survives a disease destined to end the human race, unleashed in the past by "the army of twelve monkeys". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease, so scientists of his time can find a cure. Before going further, James Cole lives in a clandestine society, and animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill humans. Anyway, when they return it in time, they actually send it to 1990, where they send it to a mental institution because of what it tells people about the virus. During his stay, he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who is then primarily responsible for eliminating the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe) who eventually joins with Bruce to save the world (since she sees that he is right in his explanations), is sent from his time to the past and then sent to 1996. where he questions his own sanity, but then breaks through to reveal a suspense quarter-final of the film and then develops to a somewhat shocking climax, where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus (it's not really Brad Pitt) and, on the other hand, he is shot by the police as the killer escapes.
