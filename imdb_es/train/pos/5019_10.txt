Hello <br /> <br /> My name is Jessica, I'm Italian. <br /> <br /> Some time ago I saw this movie: 'For the first time', with Corin Corky Nemec. It was the story of Micheal and Mary Margaret. I need to know the song title of the most important love scene in Micheal's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In Italy this film has not been programmed for many years and I do not know how to find the song. Thank you very much for who can help me! I love this movie! It is very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
