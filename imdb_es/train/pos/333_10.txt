In all honesty, this series is as classic (as television says) as is the original poem of world literature. Far from being openly exploitative, it is a beautiful and respectful representation of one of the texts that define Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was moved by the situation of Odysseus and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which was felt but was not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (It should be mentioned that the gods that appear here are not ridiculous CGI creatures that flutter on their ankles, or models of fads badly worn in bikinis, as in Homer's work, they act through deadly agents or, rarely, they are represented by classical statues). <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not available on DVD, especially given the vastly inferior and kitschy adaptations of the Odyssey that can be found in video stores.
