This has to be one of the most beautiful, moving and stimulating films that exist. It is a good family entertainment and at the same time it makes you think a lot about the problems involved. Every time I see the "ghost of Zac riding the bike through the puddle at the end, I can not stop crying." John Thaw's performance is so touching and it's a shame he is not with us anymore. Outstanding.
