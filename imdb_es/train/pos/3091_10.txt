['This show is totally worth seeing. It has the best talent cast I&#39;ve seen in a long time. The premise of the show is unique and fresh (I guess ABC executives are not used too, since it was not another reality show). However, this show was credible with nice characters and wonderful story lines. I&#39;m probably not in the age group that they hope you like the program, since I&#39;m over forty, but many of my friends also loved it (late 30s - mid-40s) and are dying by programs of quality with talented members of the cast. I do not think that this program was given enough time to gain audience. I think if we had more time this show would have worked very well. Once again, ABC is not giving a real opportunity to a show with real potential. With so many shows, opportunity after opportunity, it&#39;s almost not worth it! They need to give quality programs a real chance and the time to click and gain audience. I really loved the characters and I expected to see each episode. I have been watching the episodes in the ABC videos and the program continues to improve and improve. Although I think they owe us one more episode (Number 13?). We want to see what we can! Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if it is possible to save this program from extinction. It certainly worked for Jerico. Some things deserve to be saved and this show is definitely one of them. SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC AT: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html']
