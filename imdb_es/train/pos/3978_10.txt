['I have had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff&#39;s book &quot;I can not find my way home&quot;, which is full of information about the culture of drugs in the United States, covering the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff !! I thought he was an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. I especially enjoyed watching the movie clips from the hippie era and the stoner culture of the 70s. The soundtrack was excellent. Who compiled it definitely was in contact with the melodies of each era. Let&#39;s hope they are packaged and sold as a CD game. I would recommend it to anyone interested in how the 1960s experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie &quot;Blow&quot;), who allegedly was responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine that came to this country in the 60s and 80s.']
