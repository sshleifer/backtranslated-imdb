The musical innovator of Rene Clair. If you want to see where the songs first led a story, this is the place. This is the story of a hungry young artist who discovers that he won the lottery just when his creditors call. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in his girlfriend's apartment and has been given to a convicted fugitive, who ... oh, but that would be revealing. <br /> <br /> This is a light and sparkling. story where much of the dialogue is sung (most people think this did not happen until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's the kind of movie they do not do anymore, and they rarely did it when they did it. A movie of the first days that plays like a movie five or six years later sounds. Clair moves her camera so that not even Busby Berkeley was doing (although to be honest, comparing the two filmmakers is unfair, since Berkeley was essentially doing dance numbers on stage and Clair was moving the camera through the "world" real"). It is an incredible little movie. and it's a lovely movie that will make you smile. It's just a fun fun. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I can not say more. It's just a nice little movie and that's really all you need to know.
