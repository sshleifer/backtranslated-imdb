['In a 1950s alternative, where an outbreak of undead (caused by a mysterious &#39;space dust&#39;) has been contained by the use of special electronic collars, a lonely young man, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly), his friend. Zombie domesticated recently acquired from the family. <br /><br /> Fido quickly becomes a substitute father of Timmy, whose real father is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or his ardent wife, played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically marked as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!). <br /><br /> However, Timmy encounters a point of discomfort when his friend&#39;s rotten neck is put on in the blink of an eye, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbor. With the authorities on the way to Fido, the problems with a couple of local thugs, and his mother forming a bond with his undead domestic help, will Timmy be able to hold on to his new friend? <br /><br /> Fido is a refreshing and deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, a refreshing version of the whole zombie game. Take Romero&#39;s zombie verse and transplant it to the small town of the 50s in the United States is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to address the issue of the &quot;reanimated dead&quot; I&#39;ve seen . <br /><br /> Connelly&#39;s Fido is a film zombie worthy of being included in the Hall of Fame of the Undead, along with Bub of Day of the Dead, and Return of the Living Dead&#39;s Tarman; It is not often that I feel empathy for a traveling corpse, but the performance of The Big Yin is so good that I actually found myself encouraging the big blue bag of pus. The rest of the cast also offers commendable performances, with the young K&#39;Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Mrs. Moss who deserve special mentions: Ray, because, for someone so young, he gets a particularly safe turn, and Moss because she It&#39;s so damn delicious! <br /><br /> This is the third zombie movie I&#39;ve seen this week (the others are Planet Terror a bit disappointing and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead), and, to my surprise, it&#39;s also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be seen in the future. <br /><br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.']
