What a perfect example of "Less is more ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines, and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo, when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks, the facial expressions, the physical drama, the emotional gesture, everything is combined to create a stronger impact. This is one of the 5 best movies without which I can not live, along with the classics such as Road Warrior. If you liked this, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart", both starring Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was also in Soldier. The "Thirteenth Warrior", starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner", starring Harrison Ford.
