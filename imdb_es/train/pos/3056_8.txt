I had placed this on my TIVO for a rainy day due to the cast, some hard-working people in the industry, and when I finally saw it I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie has a flavor similar to that of Altman (mentioned in the final credits as a "thank you" person) using seemingly unrelated independent story lines that intertwine as the movie approaches to your climax. Macy is pure, clean and honest as a man who seems unable to escape his "destiny", Sutherland interprets and portrays how few can, Neve adds splashes to a deliberately toned environment, adds Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember Mission Impossible television?), Not to mention the constant John Ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good MOVIE. The script is ordered, the dialogue is free of clich√©s and reflexive (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Suspend belief and enjoy, this is a true time well spent.
