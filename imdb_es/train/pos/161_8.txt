This silly movie is very funny for younger audiences. Their heroes are a couple of dubious detectives whose attitudes of sophomorcy take them down very silly paths. Chasing the big murder case, you'll see these detectives do everything possible to solve the crime. Without nudity, but many sexual implications, nonsense ... everything teenagers seek. Low budget, but very entertaining. Classical cult potential defined.
