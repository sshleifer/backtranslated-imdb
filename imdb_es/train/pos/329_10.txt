Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story, in my opinion), this is the best of all. Almost true to the original story, with some minor deviations and omissions, for example the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumeo the piglet recognizes Odysseus disguised in his hut, the realistic acting and the stage and the authentic costumes contribute to Make this a truly memorable masterpiece, not a Hollywood B-flick of sword and sandal. Despite the fact that the dialogue and the subtitles are completely in Italian, if one is familiar with the plot, you can still get an idea of ​​what is happening and what the actors say (as long as you have a good Odyssey text) ). by hand). At least I did, and so much that it has inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the film.
