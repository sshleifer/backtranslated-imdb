An absorbing (though repetitive and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way to move forward or advance, where attempts to feel better by violating and leaving the one below you seem to be the only option. But even here, in this desolate desert of lost dreams and without a future, that does not work, and reaching something or someone to comfort and share, a simple act of charity, gives some reward, even if only the present. Supported by reliving memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Although there is little real violence on the screen, this is a hard and brutal film about the small mentality of oppression (politically and personally) that does not facilitate entertainment. Clearly, based on a work, with a small cast, a broader and wider relationship with the social and political environment in general could have helped the film reach a wider audience.
