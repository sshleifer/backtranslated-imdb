This was a great movie! Even though there were only about 15 people, including myself, it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mom even enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged women and about 20 years old there and they seemed to enjoy it. I love the part where Corky and Ned like to like Nancy and fill their cute lol. And when she gets her roadster and Ned is there. Yes. This was a great movie, even if people underestimated it hahaha. Go see it, I bet you'll enjoy it !! I really enjoyed it and my friend too. <br /> <br /> People were so hard on this movie and they had not even seen it. I bet the next time you'll give the movie and the actresses a chance. Everyone did a great job in my opinion. But if you have small children it is still appropriate. I will probably take my 7 year old niece to see her too.
