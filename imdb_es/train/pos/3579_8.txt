['The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama of the 80s. Considering the amount of people famous or soon to be famous in the film, one wonders how it could have been overlooked. This is a slow, moody, but moving story of a tragedy that happens to a family of farmers. The film is more or less an indictment of the stoic values of the Midwest and the suppression of emotion. The movie will not suit all tastes, but anyone who can appreciate the true human drama should be fine. <br /><br /> In the first moments of the film, we see two brothers who leave early in the morning to pick up some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they are lucky. While climbing up a barbed wire fence, the gun is accidentally fired and the younger boy shoots his older brother. These guys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course. The way for two men to properly pass through a fence like this with a pistol would be as follows: The first man climbs through. The second man passes the weapon through the fence. The first man then lowers the weapon and helps the other to cross the fence. At no time should any of the two men have their hands on the weapon and the fence. <br /><br /> Anyway, once they kill their brother, Arnold, 12, returns to his own world. He does not even run to ask for help after his brother is shot. Just go ahead and collect the peas and then tell your family about the accident. At no time during the funeral or the investigation, Arnold seems to show any remorse or sadness at all. Your family seems to avoid it. Maybe they&#39;re even mad at him for killing his brother. An intrepid uncle played by Frederick Forrest is angry with Arnold, even though the death of the older brother allows him to hit the boy&#39;s girlfriend. Arnold&#39;s parents do not seem to understand how to deal with their son. They really do not even try to talk to him. About the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather, who is played in the typical grandfather skill by Wilford Brimley. After a while, Arnold even moves with the old timer. <br /><br /> Nothing seems to make Arnold open until he takes a strange road trip to Reno Nevada to inexplicably look for his uncle&#39;s ex-wife. Once she knows her, she begins to emerge from her shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage at the start of the family&#39;s turmoil with the accident. From here, the film becomes a quick study of reconciliation and awakening. <br /><br /> The performance is disturbingly distant in most cases. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are the parents of perfect stoic farms. Forrest is good, but maybe he&#39;s trying to channel Paul Newman&#39;s performance on Hud. The cinematography is exceptional, too. If you like whimsical images about ordinary people, this may be for you. Some may even be advised to bring some tissues. 8 out of 10 stars <br /><br /> The hound.']
