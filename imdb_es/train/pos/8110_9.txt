['Incredible effects for a movie of this era. A manual of the uselessness of war and how war becomes a nutrient of itself. <br /><br /> One wonderful thing about this movie is that it is now in the public domain and available on archive.org. Without charge, it is not necessary to register. Watch it in one session and you will be propelled. <br /><br /> I plan to share this movie with as many people as possible, since I had never heard of it and I am a fan of science fiction. <br /><br /> I would like to see how others react to this movie. <br /><br /> Look at it. <br /><br /> Rate it <br /><br /> Tell us what you think']
