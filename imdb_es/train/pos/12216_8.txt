The film only entered the cinema in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after its official release, and after many illegal DVDs had reached the public. Apparently, the popularity of illegal DVDs led to the release in theaters, with audiences still to come. <br /> <br /> The film is a great epic, which brings Japanese culture to your home in an exciting way. In a sometimes humorous way, the story of a theater writer who writes a story for his theater is told, since Kabuki's regular plays are something he finds boring. <br /> <br /> At first, the audience might be a little confused about what story we are following, but when the story unfolds, we see that the love between a human human and a demon woman leads to a great story for a new piece of Kabuki theater. <br /> <br /> The audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to have really happened in Japanese mythology and traditions, but that does not matter. <br /> <br /> The way in which history is told with love for the theater. The expression, the vivid colors, humor and tragedy make this a great trip on the roller coaster of Japanese cinema, as well as theater. <br /> <br /> Let yourself go completely when you see this movie, try to see it. in a movie theater instead of on your TV at home. <br /> <br /> However, there is a critical point: the soundtrack is sometimes a bit annoying. Although most of it is good music, there are some moments in the movie that I think should have chosen more dramatic music. But maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose also for the lighter moments of music.
