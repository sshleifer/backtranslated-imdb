The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Actually, this episode is exactly the same content as the pilot version of DVD. That said, episode 01 provides a very important background to the very popular series "Battlestar Galactica" (both the original version and the new version of 2007). It applies significantly more to the 2007 series. Like the latest trends in science fiction, this series explores life or the "virtual" environment. In addition to this, we are given a lot of information about the Adama family line, as well as its relationship with the undisclosed creator (in the Battlestar Galactica series) of the Cylons. For the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular theme of "virtual" life and (as expected) the early life of the colonies and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed this episode. Although it was not new material for me or for anyone who has already seen the DVD release of the Caprica pilot, the series looks very promising. As is the case with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a perch on the cliff to make sure that a public (follow-up) (science fiction community) follows them. I will definitely continue to seek resolution and development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
