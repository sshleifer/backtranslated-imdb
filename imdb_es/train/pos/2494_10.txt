These first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and were not very funny and had a dramatic element in which Bill (the mother) struggled with all the usual problems of life, but that element was a little depressing and did not It mixed well with the elements of the comedy that is probably the reason why it was abandoned. After that, it soon became one of the funniest comedy series ever made by the BBC. The chemistry between the characters of Bill and Ben was very funny and there were always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series. The Christmas specials were fun and a real Christmas gift. <br /> <br /> The show stopped when the main actor Gary Olsen died playing Bill, which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films like Up 'n' Under and a very funny man RIP <br / > <br /> This understated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and should not be repeated so often. Although it appears on UKTV Gold from time to time, but must be repeated on the BBC one or two to show This brilliant comedy for a new audience.
