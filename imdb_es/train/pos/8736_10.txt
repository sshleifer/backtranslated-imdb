You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty will probably not disappear in the first, second or third visualization, but you will be attracted to the characters that are so simple but intriguing that you can find them. really taking care of them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a bit childish due to the medium. <br /> <br /> Disney continues to firmly hold the title of "The World's Greatest Animation", with "The Life of an Insect" is one of his greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments are the delicious "shots" added at the end of the film. The DVD has two sets of these output jacks where, as I said, the VHS cassette has an alternate tape version. The DVD also includes "The Game of Gerry," which is a small and charming little PIXAR that was also shown before the movie in theaters. <br /> <br /> Is this by far the best insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", which to be fair is quite good, but lacks something in the animation and in the development of the story and the characters. If you look at the main voices of both films, "Antz" is largely broadcast with the big name of "movie" stars with a few familiar stellar voices of "TV", where "Life of an insect" is everything otherwise, loaded with "TV" stars Kevin Spacey as the only outstanding exception. But the difference in quality is clear and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks can not be blamed or surprised, however, when you face Disney, you have to work hard for yourself. This is the kind of movie that almost makes me wish I had children to share it with. However, do not think for a second that this is just a movie for children.
