"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I've ever seen. The name of the film can be translated into English as "the bearer of the sword". The main hero (Sasha) was born with an exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword that emerges from under the skin in his hand. At first glance, it may seem a silly superhero of the movie without meaning about unreal events and feelings. But it's not about mechenosets. It can hardly be called the antihero. I think he's just a person who lost meaning in his life and faith in good, justice and love. In his life he has never met anyone who could understand him and love him (except his mother). Each of his steps is stained with blood; he avenges everyone for his gift that became a condemnation for him. And suddenly he meets her. She does not need idle talks and explanations. She loves him for what he is. She does not care what he did. The fact that he is with her is more important than anything else. But he soon discovers his secret: he kills two people (his ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her before his very eyes. Even after that, he could not escape his feelings. They try to run, but it's hard to hide. Finally they have a serious car accident. He is caged she is in a psychiatric hospital They do not know anything about each other, but she believes that he will save her. He overcomes many obstacles but finally finds it. They run again but they are not invulnerable. She's hurt, she needs to rest, but the police almost catch them. He does not know what to do, they drive to a corner, and then his sword begins to cut trees, helicopters around, but there is no need to do so, because she is already dead in his arms, and he is the lonely person in the whole world of new.
