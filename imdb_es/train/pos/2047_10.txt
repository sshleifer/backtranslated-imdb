['This movie caught my attention. At 29, I remember the 80s and my father working in a factory. I thought, if I also worked a lot, if I had pride and I never gave up, I could also have the American Dream, the house, some children, a car that everyone could call mine. However, I have noticed that, without a degree in something (unlike my father who resigned in ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can not get anywhere. <br /><br /> I would like to know if someone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It&#39;s made for television, and I just saw it an hour ago. I can not find it anywhere! I would love to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, relatives and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that Americans would once work to feel honor and that we are proud of what we do. accomplished!! I think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things that are being done abroad ...']
