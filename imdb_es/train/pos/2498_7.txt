I picked this up on the "Danger after Dark" set and saw it solely because of my interest in the performance of Hyde and Gackt. I expected a corny horror movie that was a great gore-fest and with very bad dialogue. Which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in the United States. Instead, I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters and the way Sho (Gackt) develops through the film as a person. The acting skills of both stars were surprisingly good, considering that they are not professional actors, and the director did a wonderful job with all this, establishing it in the future minus the flying cars and the holographic billboards. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other film I've seen him in is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this film he seems to be exactly the opposite of Shogo. Toshi is brilliant, exuberant and hyperactive, and serves as a kind of comic relief with his antics. Shogo was the big tough guy on the island that he killed without thinking about anything. Therefore, be careful with your performance. If you are familiar with Battle Royale, you will be very surprised. <br /> <br /> But the summary that is on the back of the box will not leave you surprised. , because this is not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. That the character of Hyde is a vampire is almost a fact in the background with what is really happening in the foreground, and you will love the last scene. It is a really moving image in some points, the photography is very well done. It's definitely something to pick up the next time you're in Blockbuster.
