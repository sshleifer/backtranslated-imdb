This is a great series of Canadian comedy. The film tells how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay- (Julian) and the main author of the show and their friends Rickie and Bubbles play it over in what is a real-life satirical look at the caravan parks and the inhabitants of said garbage bells. . The movie will tell you why Rickie and Julian start making their most advanced forays into the crime world. WHY and the reasons behind it all would be a spoiler, so I will not give the real reasons behind their brightest adventures. His friend and partner often (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole show is brilliant and missing the film will not affect the way the sit-com looks a bit. It is a comedy with a capital C and a bright satire in the life of the trailer park and small-time criminals with little ideas but big dreams. If you ever have the opportunity to see - buy - steal this program, get it. You will be happy to have done it. And my American friends --- they will separate you too. 10 of 9. Brilliant. TV how television should be.
