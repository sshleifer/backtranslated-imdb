THE VAN is a simple picture of adolescence made especially for the trip that does everything possible to make you feel comfortable, providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny Devito has a small but abundant role as a car wash manager and almost steals the show! All potential customers are well acted, the characters are complex and the address is quite competent for this type of image. An international release of the crown.
