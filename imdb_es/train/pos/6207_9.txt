I just watched this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans will not be disappointed! And if you are not familiar with the work of this director ... it does not matter. This movie can definitely stand on its own. I have to go to the second screening ... it was amazing, I need to see it again, and fast! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. The dialogue is very intelligent, and Parker Posey's performance is outstanding, as he stars in the main role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the last feature that takes the world and the characters introduced in the film Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most outstanding stylistic characteristic employs the usual use of the inclined (or Dutch) angle, which can often be seen in Hartley's earlier works that appear in several short films, available in Possible films: short works by Hal Hartley, 1994 collection -2004. and in The Girl from Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie more accurately on September 11th. Textually, Fay Grim's adventure in this story is a backdrop against the changed world after September 11, 2001. Without going into big spoilers, I see this work and the world of stories as a courageously political and original portrait of the geopolitics that is rarely. if ever, in the foreground in post-911 traditional fiction film until now (see Syrianna: from side note: Mark Cuban Exec, Prod in both films ... the most interesting, to say the least). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those very attached to the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this film is hilariously shy and self-referential. That said, the character of Fay Grimm begins in the film, exactly where he was when Henry Fool finished, but at the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience have changed and expanded throughout the course of the narrative. What can be expected for the future of Fay and the Fool family ...? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
