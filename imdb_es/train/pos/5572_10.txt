['This movie was hysterical. I have not laughed so much in a long time. I mean, it&#39;s not &quot;Good Will of Hunting,&quot; but was it supposed to be? In fact, I entered the advanced projection, I expected much less and I was pleasantly surprised. The comedy hits hard and is fairly constant. Amanda Peet is hot and awesome. All the audience that I designed it with seemed to be enjoying the movie as much as I did.']
