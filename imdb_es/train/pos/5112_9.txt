This movie has it all, action, fight, dance, bull riding, music, beautiful girls. This film is an authentic look at Middle America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. A lot of oil money, lots of women and lots of nonsense. Too bad everyone has gone now. The film is essentially that another boy knows a girl, the boy loses the girl, the boy recovers the girl, but is redeemed by the actors and the music. There is absolutely no movie with better music than this movie, and that includes American Graffiti. It's a movie that I see again and again and I never tire of it. Every time I see it, I'm young again, and it's time to go outside. The only reason I only gave you a 9 is because you can not rate a movie with a zero, I do not think you should rate a 10.
