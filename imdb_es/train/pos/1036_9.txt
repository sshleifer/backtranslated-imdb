Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films made during the Second World War. Paul Lukas certainly deserved his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brightly as the great actress and beauty that she was. I would recommend this film to those interested in that era and, of course, to the fabulous films of the late, great Mrs. Bette Davis.
