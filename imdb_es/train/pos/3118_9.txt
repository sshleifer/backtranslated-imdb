['Having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of the Bourne films, I was a little reluctant to see The Bourne Ultimatum. <br /><br /> However, it was a very exciting experience and I did not have the problem of not understanding what was happening because I did not see the first two films. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it reached the interval! I do not think I&#39;ve ever seen a movie so exquisitely made and exciting, especially an action movie. Since I usually avoid action and suspense movies, this was great news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most fascinating films, it draws attention from the first second until the last minute before the credits come out. <br /><br /> Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I&#39;ve heard a lot about their excellent performances at the Bourne 1 + 2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. I hope to see more of your movies in the future. <br /><br /> The maneuvers were handled with style, each one was done brilliantly and I was impressed by the impression of this film. Well done.']
