I love this movie. It was one of my favorite movies. The action never stops. The whole movie was done very well. The end is really good. Besides being full of action, they even have a surprise for you. When I saw what the movie was about on the Internet, I was not sure if I wanted to watch this movie, but I have the feeling that I am a big fan of Luke Perry and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I gave him a chance because this was a very good movie. It was very original. Whoever has thought about this movie receives an ovation from me. The performance was great. Luke Perry did an excellent job once again. I give this movie the highest rating.
