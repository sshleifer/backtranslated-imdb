Rating "10/10" Masterpiece <br /> <br /> Some years ago, I heard Spielberg comment that he would remake the film here and there if I had the chance. Well, Mr. Spielberg, I suppose nothing is perfect, but this movie, along with Schindler's List, is the best. Even Oprah acts well in this case! <br /> <br /> What impressed me the most was the realism of the story and the drama. Things like these happened and are still happening in the world.
