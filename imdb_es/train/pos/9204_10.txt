The story of Hare Rama Hare Krishna came to the mind of Dev Anand when he saw the hippies and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu, where he visited after the protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He had little heart because his film had been opposed and some had burned the posters of Prem Pujari. But the life of the hippies rekindled a story in Dev's mind to turn it into a movie. <br /> <br /> This was perhaps Dev Anand's best management effort. The movie was a super blockbuster at the box office and Zeenat Aman, as Dev's sister, had a tremendous impact. <br /> <br /> This movie was Dev Anand's call to the nation to maintain its moral values. <br /> <br /> It is an Indian family based in Montereal and the brother's role is very affectionate for his sister. But the parents fight and separate leaving Prashant (Dev) with his mother and Jasbir (Zeenat) with his father. He is repeatedly told that his mother and brother are dead and that he finally believes that he will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> She is mistreated by her stepmother and runs away from home. Dev becomes a pilot and discovers that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies. <br /> <br /> To meet his sister, Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz), who later marries him and also Janice, who is actually Jasbir with a new name and a new identity . She has forgotten her childhood and also Dev. <br /> <br /> Dev has to get her sister back among all the other events that include her suspected thief in Kathmandu and people are after her life. <br /> <br /> This was a well-directed and acted story, both by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz. But the music of Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman, but Burman Da did not want Dev to make the film. He was very close to Dev and his previous movie Prem Pujari, although he was good, but he had opposed himself in Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter theme, since he thought that the cult hippie movie could rekindle the wrath of the people against Dev. But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was really a success. <br /> <br /> R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing to the award-winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie.
