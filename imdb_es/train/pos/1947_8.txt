['SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. I would have liked to see the crew adapt to life on earth after their return. I suppose the writers anticipated this problem by &quot;loading&quot; some sequences of Voyager on earth at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that timeline has been eradicated, so everything is debatable). I liked how Admiral Janeway died for the crew of Voyager. As fans, we can have our cake and eat it, making Janeway make the ultimate sacrifice and keep living. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older self who had conversations were strange and how easily they could have crossed the line into the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) succeeded.']
