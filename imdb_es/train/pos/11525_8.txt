This movie is amazing for three main reasons. It is aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved that. There is a theme of striking colors throughout the film with extraordinary costumes and picturesque ensembles. A photograph that seems very expensive (and probably was not) completes the appearance. I always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits / loners who come together and become a family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s but not this one. This group of actors really portrays very defective characters, but extremely nice. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the truck and the theme of the movie Road, I could not help remembering my favorite movie from last year's Little Miss Sunshine ??). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and I got a little bothered by the performance of Til Schweiger at times. The opening scene, all the scenes where they ruin their tricks are very funny. There is a mixture of humor and emotion throughout the film. I really like the end. And, of course, it is the subject of the magician. A good magician is making the audience look where they want, to create an illusion. What happens is exactly what a film director does and that is why they call it a magic movie.
