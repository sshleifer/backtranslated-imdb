['I&#39;ve seen a couple of movies about eating disorders, but this was definitely my favorite. The problem with the others was that people with eating disorders towards the end simply improve automatically or accept the fact that they need help and that&#39;s it. This movie I thought was more realistic because in this the main character of Lexi does not automatically improve. She improves and then has a problem. I think that this film shows more than the others that I have seen that improving not only happens, it is hard work and it takes time, it is a long road to recovery. I think this movie shows all that very well. There should be more movies like this one.']
