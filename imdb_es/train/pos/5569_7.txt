The next film by Cheech & Chong (1980) was the second film starring the duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. The adorable burned smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building looking for ways to get more smoke and simply rest all day. But Cheech is "responsible". He has a job and a stable girlfriend. One day, Cheech wants his monster to get going, so he tries to get Chong out of the house. Another problem also arises, Cheech's brother "Red" (Cheech is another role) is in the city and wants to be with him. Declaring that he could kill two birds with one stone, Cheech pawns Chong and Red. What kind of adventures do Chong and Red get into? Will Cheech get his freak? How long will Chong last without smoking? Just watch the NEXT CHEECH & CHONG MOVIE to find out! <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong takes over the reigns of direction for the sequel. He received some experience when he did non-accredited work in UP IN SMOKE. Fun but not as good as the first movie. But Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
