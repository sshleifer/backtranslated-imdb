Last night I saw this as a late television movie by sheer chance. The movie's propaganda said something about the effect of the mother staying with her daughter and continuing her romantic journey. While tuning, the carpenter works hard in a new conservatory, played by Daniel Craig no less, so the plot was immediately evident. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the love interest of a mother of the same name for the carpentry is also the boyfriend of the daughter, so they are brewing problems and there are not too many surprises. But I was surprised by the convincing performance of Anne Reid and I was hooked. The address allows you a lot of space to look in the mirrors and adjust the scarves when you exude sadness. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes were fascinating and broke the taboo. Should not the bodies of older women remain hidden? Not here and we give ourselves a delicious awakening in the Mother's sexuality. Even more surprising are the drawings that made (SPOILER!) Once discovered confirm your daughter's suspicion that something is happening here. <br /> <br /> Cathryn Bradshaw since the daughter did not convince me as much as the rest of The Cast, but that could be me. With his waves of pre-Raph locks I kept waiting to see Julia Sawahla, whose most intense face would have better adapted the confrontations to my mind. Bradshaw has a happier, more round face that did not have the anger that arises as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> The end is weak. If the goodbyes for the Mother when she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent, maybe we could see some close-ups of those who say goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. Regardless of what she has done, she is a recently deceased widow who goes to the solitary house she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found that the lack of sympathy is alarming. For a film so full of emotion (and I warn you it's like opening champagne, you'll never put the lid back) the end is a cold contradiction.
