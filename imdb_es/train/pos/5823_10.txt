At Micro Phonies, the puppets are the best. In this short film the trio are handymen working in a recording studio. They end up watching Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) singing the voice of spring. The voice is amazing. Curly in drags is heard by Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe calls Curly Senior Cockroach. The three stooges end up going to a party where Curly goes to disguise. They play a disc of the voices of spring and all goes well until Moe destroys the disc in Curly's head. They end up using the lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes them and unplugs them. Alice Van Doren catches the child screaming and hides behind a curtain to help them. Everything is fine until the baritone wonders how Curly sings without the help of a phonograph who discovers Alice behind the curtain. The three henchmen are revealed as frauds, but Alice's father discovers her daughter's talent and agrees that she should become a singer. The puppets are thrown out of the room. Excellent.
