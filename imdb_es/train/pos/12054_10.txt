The first time I saw this movie here in the UK was in December 1989 when Central TV aired it. I still have the videotape, although worn out (over the years, many friends and family have borrowed it and have also cooled off with it). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember coming home that night, having a Christmas drink, turning off the lights and seeing what was advertised as a 'Christmas Ghost Story'. Even now I remember certain scenes that still wrap my hair around my neck ... <br /> <br /> I have seen some comments about the film that say that it is not this and not that ... I think those people are scared to on Friday the 13th and similar, they stalk and rammel, which are laughable. This is a 'traditional' ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effects ... no swearing, no blood, no free sex scenes, no chainsaws or weapons, etc. How refreshing! It is atmospheric. If you like horror chilling, well written, well acted and with a genuinely frightening environment, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; Only last night I saw the original Haunting and that is an excellent movie. Very atmospheric again, and so is the woman in black. The end of the film differs from the book, but it's still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you'll like it if you like traditional ghost stories ... Then ... turn off the lights, light the fire, close the doors, have a drink ... and enjoy ...:)
