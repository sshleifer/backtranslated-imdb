I never saw this movie and I enjoyed the singing and dancing of Cagney and the other cast members, namely: Dick Powell (Scott Blair), who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler, (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent, who writes musicals and eventually devotes himself to producing Prologues that are shown among movies shown in theaters during the 1930s. Chester has problems with people trying to steal their ideas for their shows This is a very entertaining movie with lots of comedy and lots of laughs. Joan Blondell, (Nan Prescott) gave a great supporting role that was also very young and pretty. Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just started with his long and successful film career. Enjoy.
