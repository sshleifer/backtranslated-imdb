When the Grinch came out, I was excited, although I thought it was going to be a lucky movie and it was. Even though I had a bit of a nightmare before the Christmas touch. You know a little dark and creepy. I loved this movie because it helped fill people with the Christmas spirit. So especially the Grinch saved Christmas. And what happened then well in Whoville, they say that the little heart of the Grinch grew three sizes that day. HAPPY GRINCHMAS!
