The last tribute to a great film actress. The film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen. How great poetry is timeless. The direction, cast, script, music, lyrics, in fact, all the rules for making movies are chosen perfectly to suit the message of the film. The Muslim society in India has never been presented with such respect, nobility and reality. The script is memorable in the hands of Meena, Ashok, Raaj Kumar, Nadira, etc., to name a few. impressed by the real aspect of Kamal Kapoor. The lasting legacy of the filmmaker Kamal Amrohi's subculture. A very beautiful film about a controversial issue that makes humanity see and face the reality of the marginalized in the world. "In ka naam? Pakeeza! Haan Pakeza." Such performance is unprecedented in this era of sex, dance and pornography.
