Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what this movie was about, these names were enough to attract me. Magnificent, talented and popular, these are the artists to whom we must pay attention. <br /> <br /> Ok, where do I start? We already know what the movie is about. Five beautiful girls that a "romantic" serial slasher points to, a boy that everyone rejected at the school dance 13 years ago. Its trademarks include subtle death threats disguised as Valentine's cards, chocolates infested with worms and a bloody nose. Your weapon of choice: well, take an ax, a knife, an electric drill, a bow and arrow, a hot iron, etc. Well, basically it's a horror movie with a nice sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror movies should not be Shakespeare, but I will not go there. I love horror movies, but not all. This one, I adore. It's up there with some of my other favorites. It's fun, sexy and scary. The killer's mask is childishly spooky, and watching Cupid shoot a bow and arrow at a victim is really strange. The performance is first class: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are very funny. I really wanted to see much, much more of Katherine Heigl. I am one of your biggest fans and I would love to see her doing some important work soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress, and Jessica Cauffiel can play the blonde role she perfected in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were good too; Hedy Buress was a hoot ('bleedmedry.com') and that younger version of Denise Richards looked very scary to her. <br /> <br /> Highlights: Each scene of death had a particular distinction. The most spooky is the opening scene in the morgue. The hottub scene, though ridiculous, was well done. And the audiovisual labyrinth was sinister. The soundtrack is great, with spooky music and some fine alternative melodies. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I felt that the killer had not shown up enough, we barely saw the mask and he did not show up at all. during the climax. I also thought that the climax was really out of focus, but still fun. <br /> <br /> The turnaround at the end was not such a big surprise, but I'm very glad that the filmmakers have decided to save us all that. "explaining the murderer's routine". <br /> <br /> I do not like to tell people what movies they should watch, but if someone asked me to choose a horror movie that I thought was really worth seeing, then Valentine would be. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
