I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see him again as soon as he finished. The cast was excellent, the plot was entertaining and entertaining, and it was a nice movie in general! I would rate this as one of the best thrillers I've seen! The girls there were also very nice, especially Denise Richards. She was very intrepid during the movie and gave OOMPH something to her character!
