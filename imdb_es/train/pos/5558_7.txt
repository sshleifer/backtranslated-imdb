This story is familiar in Tom and Jerry's long-running cartoons, especially in the 1940s, with the only difference that two cats instead of one are threatened with eviction if they do not catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an unnamed friend ("Butch?") Who lives in the house with him, so this really annoys "Mammy Two Shoes" who can not believe they have a mouse despite TWO cats in the house. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the one who catches Jerry can stay while the other gets the boot, so the competition is underway! <br /> <br /> Even though it's a familiar territory, I still enjoyed this because the caricature had enough original gags to make it entertaining. Not only did you have the cats competing against each other, but Jerry in the equation, so there was Enough gags that you would definitely recommend if you are a Tom & Jerry fan.
