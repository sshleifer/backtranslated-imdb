I remember seeing this movie years ago, I think, BBC2. I would very much like to see him again. Does anyone know how I can get a copy? As a reminder, it was an especially powerful film, in particular, the scene that stands out is that of horses with gas masks. Apart from that, I really can not remember much about the story, that's why I want to see it again! I have tracked the network but I can not find a copy, which is unusual in my experience, there may not be a DVD or VHS of this movie on the market. I would appreciate any help anyone can give me about this. Thank you very much in advance for your help. Best regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
