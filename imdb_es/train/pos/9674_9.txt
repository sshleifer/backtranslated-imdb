I did not give this movie a perfect score to be honest compared to great classics like "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaurai". However, this movie is so wonderful that it is a real pity that the overall score is so bad for the general IMDb voter. However, the IMDb voter is geeky, and "Paulie" does not qualify for that. <br /> <br /> The only criticism I could suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did not play the perfect stutterer. I'm sorry, but to ask a 6-year-old boy to beat Dustin Hoffman because Rainman is asking for the impossible in making films. <br /> <br /> Overcoming that little complaint, the film has the best of many movies: Buddy road trip, board games, hero as a friendly party animal (party bird?), Disney humor for young and old, etc. What do I not like? Tony Shaloub uses his role as a pair of comfortable jeans. That's normal for him, it seems. ("I'm Russian ... I LIKE long stories.) I do not like mangoes, but I almost want to go out and buy one, watch the movie and that will make sense. <br /> <br /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin makes very appropriate appearances in the film.The roles are well suited for what we all know about them.I've always found Jay Mohr a bit viscous, and his role on the screen also fits that ... The only surprise for I was discovering that Jay was also Paulie's voice, and in the end, even that works well, bringing together Parrot and anti-Parrot as a team and creating a magic of their own. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to find a movie for you and the children that is not insulting or boring to either of you, "Paulie" is a perfect candidate, however, I will admit that a happy moment influences my review of "Paulie." I was on a road trip during a The heat wave of the car went out, half of them restored We cooled down (like our hotel) and I said: "Let's see a movie where there is air conditioning in operation. itioning. "So we did it, so for 100 minutes they refreshed us, we had fun and they gave us a moving experience." When I saw it recently on a VCR in less emotional circumstances, I realized how good this movie was made. <br /> <br /> It's a sleeping movie that you will not regret seeing.
