This is another great movie that I was lucky enough to see on the big screen for the first time (thanks to Rick Baker and others). At the end of the 80s, I was relatively new to the genre and I was only really new about the three big JC, SH and YB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid the money I earned with so much effort to see this in a "Triple bill of Classics" at the old Scala. I should not have worried, this movie took my breath away. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and you have not seen this movie, do it NOW!
