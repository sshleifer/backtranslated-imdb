I have loved this movie all my life. It is also such an intelligent story, with many classic allusions. eg The ship that disappeared decades earlier was called Bellerophon. Well, in classical mythology this was the man who killed the Chimera, a legendary beast composed of two or more creatures. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly the same chimer and his monster id. <br /> <br /> I like movies where writers have clearly credited their audiences with a minimum of intelligence, unlike most modern box office hits that spend $ 150 million on special effects, but around $ 1.50 in a script. <br /> <br /> Regards
