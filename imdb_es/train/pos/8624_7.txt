What is the best way to start a review of a movie like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I have just seen this film directly and that the images are still etched deep in my brain, and I do not think they move soon. <br /> <br /> It's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea of ​​what kind of movie this is, even if you have not seen it. Otherwise, let me warn you that this is not a gem of a moderate budget that has been lost for some years to the "Near Dark", nor is it a low-budget B series movie. What is low budget art, presented in a simple but moving way? The idea is a simple one: seven stories that revolve around and end in suicides interspersed with images of a decomposing corpse. It sounds simple right, even boring? It's not. Words can not really describe how powerful this movie is when you get to the middle; It virtually attracts you whether you want to go or not. <br /> <br /> I could give a tour here about the technical pros and cons of the address; perhaps note that the scenes are obviously filmed in Super-8 cameras and that sometimes they are unstable. I could point out that some of the sound effects are out of sync in a way that rivals any Fulci movie, but at the end of the day everything seems to become insignificant. <br /> <br /> So far as the extreme films go, I have seen the most difficult ones, and yet, Der Todesking touched me in a way that few have achieved, despite not being particularly bloody and having very few scenes that I would consider "free". In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last story. I will not ruin it, just to say that the emotional agony of the character practically drips from the screen and makes you sympathize, if you do not long for its end. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not the best movie ever made, and in many places it seems coarse and maybe a bit amateur, but despite these flaws, Der Todesking is an experience I would recommend to anyone he likes the challenging cinema. If you are someone who likes comfortable or "nice" movies, or just want to win something brutal and meaningless, this is not what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy it or not, it is one you will not quickly forget.
