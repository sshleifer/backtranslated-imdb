In the colonies we are not very familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost skipped this movie (he had his TCM preview recently) because of the negative comments here about his appearance on "Ghost Train", which he hoped would be completely annoying . Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and its synchronization when writing a line suggest what you would get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. It can not be compared to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual comic relief providers that appear in movies of this genre. One can also feel the thread that unites Askey with British comedy 30 years later; at least, from the American point of view, it is clear that it has more in common with the Monty Python company than with any of its counterparts here. As for the rest of the movie, the more films you have seen, the more likely you are to guess the ending, but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and it is worth waiting for your next appearance.
