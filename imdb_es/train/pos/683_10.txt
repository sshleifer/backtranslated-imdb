I like ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that can not be explained. Now I have seen many of them. As special effects have more and more control over today's movies, sometimes to find a real gem, you have to roll back the clock to the time when writers and directors really had to use their heads to create ghost stories. good. Now, this very rare pilot episode of the Ghost Story television series called "The New House" was one of the most terrifying movies I've seen. It was once in 1972, ... I was only 9 years old, ... but nothing since then, not even compared to that. With all the remake that is happening in Hollywood, someone should do this "as is" without more special effects than the original. This episode was terribly creepy as hell. I'm lucky to finally find it on DVD today and it's very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 Ghost Stories that even came close were the ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling." I wish someone would make more ghost stories like these.
