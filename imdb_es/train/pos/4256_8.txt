What a lovely movie! Very comforting One can not help but fall in love with the character of Gigi. He is adorable as a child and becomes a sensitive artist. The whole movie revolves around him. Live in a wonderful world? living all my life? Curiosity, desire and anticipation. There is an older brother who tries to steal his glory, but he really remains in the shade all his life. The father is very stereotypically Italian and so is the mother. Did he want the father to come and meet the mother in the last scene? And make them cry and laugh. I also wish there was at least something that redeemed the older brother. His personality seems to have been completely destroyed. Passion and burning? That is the key to life. And looking through the camera? Focusing on small details and savoring the delicate details of life.
