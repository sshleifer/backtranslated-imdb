Here is another movie that does not really need a lot of recommendation. It is a classic comedy, very funny and entertaining and, of course, inspired a successful television series that many would say was even better (I enjoy both, personally). <br /> <br /> For some, it's hard to heat up Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were weaned on the television show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe vice versa). But what we have in both cases are four good actors who in real life looked so much like their film counterparts who managed to make these characterizations of their own. It is the humorous material of Neil Simon that is key, and where the laughs really originate. <br /> <br /> For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it is the story of a neurotic and fussy fanatic (Lemmon) who is expelled from a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and installs in the Manhattan apartment of his careless and irresponsible friend (Matthau). Putting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls creates some very funny problems.
