A great gangster movie. Sam Mendes has directed this beautiful film that shows another camaraderie of father and son. The brilliant star cast that stars alongside Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) has done an excellent job. Also acting as Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. The tasting is too good. The plot is pretty good. You will enjoy the movie. A great representation of the gangster of the 1930s. Established in the 1930s, it will surely stand out as the zenith of all the gangster films of that era. The soundtrack is quite good and suitable for the movie. A great movie in the whole that shows what a father does to protect his son.
