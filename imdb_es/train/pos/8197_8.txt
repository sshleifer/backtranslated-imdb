**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Continue, Make my day!' <br /> <br /> The fourth image of the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who is rumored to direct most of the Magnum Force) and brings the violent society of the first two films. However, the film still lacks impact and credibility. This film premiered at the beginning of the 80s, the time of Regan and the young republicans. The premise of a raped woman who takes revenge on her rapist does not appeal to this time frame. This plot would have been better for the Enforcer, which actually would have been a good movie. What Sudden Impact needed was a plot on Wall Street but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
