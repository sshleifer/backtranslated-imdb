The other night I pulled this arbitrarily out of the library, having no idea of ​​the cult or influence of the movie, or that it is currently being presented as a musical. (!) Most of the comments here are specific, they are touching, funny, sad, and yes, a bit exploitative despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The extended edition of Chriterion is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that disappeared, you can also hear it in the old movies of Jackie O; People do not talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the house fell into disrepute, at least Old Edie seems to be aware of what is happening to some extent; Could not she see the spectacular house disintegrating? <br /> <br /> However, the theme of the film is the life that the two women have built for themselves now, an act of real-life Tennessee Tennesse Williams. Well worth your time.
