I have never danced flamenco before, but somehow I feel that this movie was perfect. The colors, the brazen dances, the gypsies and the rivals together made a film that seemed to have ended too soon. I have seen other films by Carlos Saura and I agree that this film may be his best production. I feel that the best features of their previous films were put together and aligned to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors to reveal the activity that takes place behind the cameras. While watching this movie, I felt as if I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, watching comfortably the dancers hitting a wooden board with a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fits like a glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this movie in the United States in the next few years. I recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the sustenance of other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list.
