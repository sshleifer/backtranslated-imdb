This film shows the people in the middle of the 2 hottest days of Austria. It shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples. It shows the inability of people to communicate or talk with other people. <br /> <br /> At the screening I attended, people were going away in the middle because they could not see the movie anymore. That's right. Because the movie is not easy to see. It has a very depressing message and there is no moment of mercy in the movie. It is a very cruel movie, not for all tastes. You can not talk about terms of enjoyment of this movie. It catches you in your throat and never lets go and in the end you simply feel out of breath due to its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can not "recommend" or "not recommend" this movie. You must make your own mind based on what I said above. Just keep in mind that this is not a regular movie and is not for everyone's taste.
