I read some terrible things about this movie, so I was prepared for the worst. "Confused, Muddled, horribly structured." While there may be merit in some of these allegations, this movie was not as horrible as its average DVD programmer. In fact, I really had aspirations. He tried something beyond the typical monster / slasher nonsense. And for God's sake, there are some interesting things that are happening. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Barbeau is a miracle to behold. She takes the film directly on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it is a masterpiece. UNHOLY finally collapses under the weight of his own ambition. There are too many (unexplained) subplots that try to coexist. And the plot of the plot created by time travel is never really addressed: for example, if Hope knows that her mother is bad and will eventually kill her brother, why not just kill Ma in the first sequence of the movie? It seems he would have conquered a hell of traveling to the future to do it. <br /> <br /> Even so, I give UNHOLY points for trying. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
