Vertigo co-stars Stewart (in his last turn as romantic protagonist) and Novak raises this, the other "Christmas movie" of Stewart, to a level of entertainment above the middle level. The chemistry between the two stars makes it a very moving experience and more revelation can be drawn from the film if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for private pain that hinders many people's relationships. In short, a nice fun with legendary stars, 7/10.
