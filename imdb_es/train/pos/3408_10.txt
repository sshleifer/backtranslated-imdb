I give this movie an A + for the whole camp! As Dietrich's daughter, Maria Riva, wrote in the book about her mother: "If you see Allah's garden in the context of the high camp, it can be a lot of fun." And how! I laughed with delight at the overloaded score and the amazingly, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. The spectators who have read the accounts of Boyer's tupia (which came off with the heat) laughed every time they appeared. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when they give their lines. instead, they look dreamily at a distance, presumably so that their faces can be photographed in the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you are starring a turkey it may look good!). Dietrich's outfits are out of this world. As Riva points out in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Travis Banton from Paramount and had him design some of the most divine dresses, like the dress and the beige gauze cape. <br /> <br /> I totally agree with the other critics that rave about the Technicolor. It is really hard to believe that the film was made in 1936, the color is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In short, if you see the Garden of Allah with an indulgent attitude and embrace its stupidity, you can not. help but enjoy it.
