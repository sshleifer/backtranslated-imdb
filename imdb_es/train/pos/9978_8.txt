I have to say that I loved the vanishing point. I have seen the original, and this is a very good remake of it. Even though it did not follow the original story (that's why I gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better story. <br /> <br /> As for the car, well, the DJ comment at the end about the Challenger going 185 mph on the bulldozers is pretty unlikely (and if you look at it, the speedometer needle would wobble 145 -150), but even though I did not see one in the engine in one of the At the beginning of the scenes where they show the engine, the original story had a supercharged Hemi, so it is possible. For those of you who say that aerodynamics would not allow it, the Chrysler 300C normally aspirated today can go to 168 mph, and if you notice that, going to a highway with it is like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. Also, in a wind tunnel test, if you put an air dam in the Challenger, it is probably more aerodynamic.
