I captured this movie last night. And last night you know that Danny Masterson was a pretty good actor in the movie, and it's great to see him on something other than the 70's show. The movie is not classified, but in my opinion I would rate it (R) just for nudity and the amount of adult content. But overall, I loved it, I thought that Dirt's shit poles were pretty funny. Basically it is a boy who has no job, girlfriend or money and, finally, gets a job as a private investigator (more than a messenger actually). It is framed in the murder of a rock star and the rock star The bride is one of The people who really need to help him. I give it .... *** 3 stars.
