It became a joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any woman to get involved with any Cartwright man. After all, Ben Cartwright was a widower three times with one child for each marriage. And any woman who became involved with Adam, Hoss and Little Joe would end up dying because we could not get rid of the formula of the widower and the three children who started this western television classic. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Bonanza were made today, the writers would have had rotating female characters that came and went from the life of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go well, others not so good, it's just life. And today we are less demanding with our heroes, so if a relationship with one of them goes south, we do not have to kill the character to keep the nobility of the survivor intact. But that is if Bonanza had ended today. <br /> <br /> But we still expected a lot from our Western heroes and Bonanza, although it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and their unconditional children. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal dad for television in whatever genre you want to name. All his life was spent in the hard work of building the immense Ponderosa that was spread by his three sons. The children were all different in personality, but they all came together in a hurry. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights became and remain an American institution. I would dare to say that more people cared for this family than the Kennedys. Only the popularity that Bonanza has in the syndication proves it. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as the eldest son, Adam, was removed from the program. It is rumored that he was not interested in the noble characters of Cartwright, who felt almost dangerous. Maybe if it had been done now, he would have liked it more than the way I describe it. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people receive three successful TV shows under his belt. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie, where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, the hottest, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. The show continued with the two younger children, but when the great Dan Blocker left, the heart left Bonanza. Other characters had been added at that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright adopted the young Mitch Vogel. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the most adorable of the Cartwrights. His sudden disappearance after surgery left a hole too big in that family. <br /> <br /> So the Cartwrights of Ponderosa have gone down in history. I understood how the United States took the Cartwrights seriously when I visited the real city of Virginia. It looks nothing like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, almost where you see Ponderosa on the map in the opening credits, is the Cartwright home, the whole maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for fans of Sherlock Holmes, the ranch and the Cartwrights are real. <br /> <br /> And if they were not real, they should have been.
