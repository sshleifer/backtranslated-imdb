Paul Greengrass definitely kept the best Bourne for last! I have heard many people complain about the way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the style of the camera to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say is ... are you kidding? Come on, it was not so bad at all. I think it helps to make the action scenes feel more realistic, which would prefer the choreography of very stylized acrobatics. As for the rest of the movie, I did not even notice it. <br /> <br /> It can be said that Damon has really been comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case it's a really good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon also has a great support cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret organization of the CIA. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie is full of great car chases and non-stop action, they managed to maintain a good amount of character development in their with all that going on. This movie is well above the other two Bourne films, and it's definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!
