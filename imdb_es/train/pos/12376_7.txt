With a cast of stars so impressive that it almost looks like the "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" of horror films, "The Sentinel" (1977) is, however, a really spooky film centered on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this, she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves to a brownstone house in Brooklyn Heights that is (and I do not think she is giving way too much on this late date) very close to the door of hell. And as a tenant in this building, she suffers much worse conditions than dripping plumbing and occasional water error, to put it mildly. In fact, the scene in which Alison meets her noisy neighbor upstairs is truly terrifying, and she should certainly send ice water running through the spines of most viewers. Despite the complaints of many critics regarding the acting ability of Raines, I thought he was fine, rather than deftly defending himself in scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The image is constructed to arrive at a really strange conclusion, and although some points of the plot have no explanation, I felt more than satisfied. As the book "DVD Delirium" says, "any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless lesbian cannibals in leotards can not be so bad". As a side note, yesterday I walked to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to take a look at Sentinel House. Yes, it is still there, and although it is devoid of its thick layer of ivy and lacks a blind priest / nun in the window of the upper floor, it is very similar to what was seen in this image. If this house really sits at the entrance to hell, I guess hell is ... the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we New Yorkers have known THAT for some time!
