I am so happy to have seen this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies and this turned out to be a real gem. I loved that the film, a kind of love story, was not about twenty-somethings; rather, it is a story of some beautiful sixty-something, who used to be twenty-somethings. It is a good story, well written and beautifully performed with fabulous music from the band of the Second World War. It also has a nice surprise for lovers of Scottish castles. He left me smiling and ready to see him again, which I did a couple more times before he returned it. I highly recommend it.
