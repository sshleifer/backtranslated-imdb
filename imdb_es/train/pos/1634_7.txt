The first time I saw the movie was its first time on HBO in (probably) 1981 and, at 15, I thought the movie was very funny. I do not remember seeing the performances of Alfred E. Neuman in the theatrical trailers. When MAD magazine satiated the film and abruptly stopped midway with apologies from the "usual gang" for indulging in satire as a piece of shit, I assumed they were making fun of themselves, which I'm sure they were, but finding them seriously (and Ron Liebman) so ashamed of removing their names from any credit, I was quite surprised. Surely there are many worst movies to be associated with. Watching the film on video now (at 32 years old) with references of MAD restored, I still like it a lot. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, where is Poppa?) I think it's his jewel in the crown of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
