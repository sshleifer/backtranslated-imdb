Hot Millions is a great movie in every way. A funny and unconventional story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals who have worked in the business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant, as always, and Maggie Smith, definitely one of the best actresses of all time, is a delight. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart complete the cast and they are also perfect. If you want a movie that has a perfect casting, here it is. What is so impressive is the way these people work together in such a natural and effortless way, creating lots of laughs and fun moments at all times. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. The direction, photography and editing are also first class, and it is an excellent time capsule of London in the 60s. It is definitely on my list of favorites of all time.
