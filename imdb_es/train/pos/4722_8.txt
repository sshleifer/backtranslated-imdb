Given the low budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. It is plausible, realistic and shows how the Csikos (Hungarian horsemen who lived in the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save an American pilot shot down from the ruthless and savage Nazis.) We are attracted by strong feelings towards the young, impressionable, However, a very brave guy who admires the American pilot If you are looking for special effects, Superman heroes and magical endings, this movie is not for you If you want to feel what it must have been to dodge the persistent and amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion will captivate us with this film, I really enjoyed it and for lovers of horses, dogs and humble and helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end, this movie will be one that will remember for a long time.
