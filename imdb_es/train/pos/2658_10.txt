Kubrick once again exhibits his impressive ability to create a perfect environment for a movie. Mainly through the cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, it creates a chilling and sinister tone that resides throughout the film and gives me a tingling spine from the beginning. It is really this impeccable environment that makes The Shining the masterpiece that is, in my eyes. Of course, it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the best performances I've seen. A terribly authentic portrait of a mad mind. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look beyond those two when the rest of the movie is so bright. In addition, it has the actor with the best name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
