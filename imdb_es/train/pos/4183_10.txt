I had seen this movie a long time ago, but it seemed incredible to me and to this day it has never stopped surprising me. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie that describes the story of a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink. Japanese boats in the port of Singapore during the high point of World War II. <br /> <br /> These commands are trapped in normal clothes and are considered spies by Japanese captors. But something happened that has not been explored much in any Hollywood WW2 movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> A close and friendly bond develops between the captors and the captives. They begin to respect each other, while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers becomes the best friend of a Japanese prison guard. This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really attracts your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, one day, while the two friends are conversing, the Australian captain learns that some other captives will be tried and executed by the sinking of the Japanese ships in the port of Singapore. <br /> <br /> He mentions that it was his team and not some others who had sunk the boats to his Japanese friend, and upon hearing this, the Japanese guard says to keep quiet, as it could lead to the execution of your whole group. But the captain stands firm by confessing this to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities condemn them to death in the most respectful manner according to their rules. This is the highest honor given to warriors captured in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most amazing part of the movie in which the Australian soldiers await their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly Japanese guard that is I'm still not ready to believe that why your friend Australian confessed to be guilty? <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending here. But it is more moving than one can imagine and can easily move to tears. <br /> <br /> In short, an excellent underestimated film that possibly did not receive the recognition it deserved internationally. Get a copy today and be hypnotized.
