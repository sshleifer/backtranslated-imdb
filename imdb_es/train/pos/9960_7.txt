['I noticed that this movie was being destroyed well before reaching the cinemas and that I did not have much hope either. I thought it was another kind of &quot;You Got Served&quot; movie with some nice dance moves and horrible performances. I was in the theater and I decided between this and Meet the Spartans and I chose this. To my surprise, the performance was not bad at all and the movie was pretty good. The fact that it has a lower rating than that of You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage published here, I recommend going to see a morning movie of this movie so as not to spend too much. I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised at how wrong everyone has been. When it comes to dance films, this is undoubtedly one of the best with a performance far superior to that of many others. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. It is to be expected that the rating will go up after it is released on DVD and that more people will watch the movie instead of judging it based on the comments before it is released. <br /><br /> The film is now approaching its correct classification. More than 1000 people have given it a rating of 9, a little too high, but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1.']
