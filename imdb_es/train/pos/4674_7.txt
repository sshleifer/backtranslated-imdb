What percentage of movies does a person see these days that makes them wonder what happened to their eight or ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO HAND! This movie is not like that. It is a story about real people who are sometimes a combination of friendly and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Disadvantage: <br /> <br /> There is not enough character development and some plot lines twist in the wind. <br /> <br /> Upside down: <br /> <br /> It forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for better or worse in their own lives. <br /> <br /> Well performed by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. <br /> <br /> It contains a bit of cheerful good humor.
