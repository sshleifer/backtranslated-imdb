I grew up watching this series. I was around seven or eight years old when I was on. I still remember the first episode that was called "The New House". It scared me so much! I can almost hear that statue, laughing madly. And the end, oh my God! The spirit of the mangers comes in the room for the child: Ay! This was classic television and it was a unique series. I have found a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. My question to any reader: Has anyone bought this game? He is a pirate. Both sellers claim to have a very good copy. I have an incomplete and poor DVD of the episode of "The New House", and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better, however, if someone knows if these are much clearer, it would be worth buying them and sharing them with my children. great series, intelligent, terrifying and audaciously supernatural. Thanks in advance to any fan that has the least importance of this. In fact, I'd love to discuss it. Chris Walker
