This movie is very fun to see if you like the films of the organized crime variety. Those looking for a crime movie starring a charismatic leader with dreams of taking charge in a bad way may be a little disappointed with the way this movie progresses. You are not familiar with Hong Kong movies, so you can be pleasantly surprised with this one. I felt a little disappointed by some of the decisions made regarding the story, but overall it was a good crime movie. Some things did not make sense, but that seems to be the norm in Eastern movies. <br /> <br /> People simply do random things, regardless of how their personalities were configured before. It's a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this movie.
