I received this Netflix movie after a long wait, so I anticipated it greatly when it arrived. My worst fears were that it would be heavy, as well ... well, do you know what all the screaming fanatics were babbling about? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? That kind of thing? Fearing I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly visible, even if the filming and the music made it feel like someone was going to get a couple of nuns every two scenes, and Gackt's acting was pretty good. Hyde, being, um, Hyde, acted as an almost romantic friend / gang character by which anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised. It's one of my two biggest problems with the movie itself. But the rest of the cast (including the children's actors in the opening scene) was very good at doing what they did, which was, for the most part, getting shot and yelling. But my second problem was very minor, related to sadness. It seemed too suspenseful, it horrified me, as in every scene in which someone is shot, either collapses, which is more sincere and dead, or stays there for a long time. But Sho just ... takes the shots, repeatedly, breaks down, bubbles a LOT as he talks, and makes Hyde cry. In short, if you're a fan of any of the actors or you're just a fan of the j-movie, it's definitely worth seeing.
