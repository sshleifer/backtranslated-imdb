['Launched two years before I was born, this Oscar-winning film has it all: lavish sets and technicolor clothing, stunning cinematography, excellent wall-to-wall Gershwin music, a superior choreography, a lighter script than the air and excellent performances by Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetary and Caron. Hollywood does not do it that way anymore. Definitely, this is my favorite movie of all time, a standard by which I judge all other films. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!']
