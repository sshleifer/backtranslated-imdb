My favorite movie of "imperialism" and one of the best action and adventure films of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with daring and wise cracks to please everyone except the "PCs" of moviegoers. Memorable scenes abound: the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting against hundreds of thugs; MacChesney & Cutter gave Bobby Coote the punch ("save a little for the elephant"); Cutter to MacChesney - "I'm an expedition"; Din breaking jailhouse Cutter with a fork ("What do you think I'm trying to break? A bloody pudding ?!) And the amazing temple scene with Cutter singing and then announcing, bold as bronze -" All right, everyone is under arrest! "<br /> <br /> I could go on, but suffice it to say that I try to capture this movie whenever it's on the scene ... For the adventurers and armchair generals, it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours
