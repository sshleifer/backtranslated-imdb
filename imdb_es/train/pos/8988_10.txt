To suggest that Anton Newcombe, of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, could also use a little therapy, is to put it mildly. In Dig! who won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, we see him and his band self-sabotage for seven years, while former friends and contemporaries The Dandy Warhols rise to comparative greatness (a mobile phone ad, anyway ). <br /> <br /> What lifts Dig! Above his contemporaries is the immense comic, almost biblical, tragedy that unfolds: a depressing and honest treatise on art against commerce and compromise. Despite his "look at me, I'm a bloody genius" stance, it is revealed that Newcombe is a singularly gifted, albeit immensely disturbed, musician far more talented than his rival, Courtney Taylor of Dandy, who narrates the image. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda of Taylor. <br /> <br /> Even sadder, Taylor seems to realize this, evidenced by his tired and self-deprecating voice: he knows his band won the battle, but in what sense? cost? In fact, they ran out, made Indie-Lite records, kept their teeth nice and clean, and probably brushed their hair twice before going to bed, earning record contracts and a large tourist bus. And discarding all the credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in filth, is continually trapped, hits the other members of the band onstage, kicks the enthusiasts in the head, and looms for the last time on Dig! being transported by the police, having lost the right to see his son. <br /> <br /> Two of the best films about the rock subculture have been directed by women: The decay of Penelope Spheeris's western civilization? An instant classic the moment it was released.
