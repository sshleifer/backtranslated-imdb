This is a type of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol look very beautiful. Soha reminds you very much of his mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the near future. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is very different from most movies. In a way, he is dissatisfied, but if he really thinks in real terms, he realizes that the only sensible ending was the end that is shown in the film. Otherwise, it would have been a serious injustice for everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is about a professional witness who meets a girl who hopes to get married in court. Her boyfriend does not show up and ends up being helped by the witness. Slowly, slowly, over time, he falls in love with her. It is unclear if she has similar feelings for him or not. Watch the movie for more details. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Abhay. I hope to see more movies of him. Soha is pretty but she did not talk much in the movie. His eyes, his innocence were the most talked.
