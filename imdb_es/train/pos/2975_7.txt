Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the 'South Park' show, come back with something completely different. Create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as baseketball. It's like basketball, except that the rules of baseball are involved and there is another letter e in the title. This is how you play: you only throw the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot. It sounds simple. In fact, I could try one day. After the game arrives. On the streets, it soon becomes a great success. Who would have known that two immature friends could invent a sport that became so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> "Baseketball" is a very crude and silly parody full of violent violence, but it actually offers some laughter and entertainment. A definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor.
