I've seen quite a few episodes of Cold Case over the years, starting with episodes from season 1 in 2003-2004. And although the majority has been good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but also has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Although some may not agree with the content of the story (that is, the romantic relationship from man to man), I doubt anyone can see this without feeling deeply moved within their spirit. <br /> <br /> The story is essentially about a case that was reopened, based on the testimony of a dying drug dealer. The two central actors are two police officers in the 1960s called Sean Coop (also known as the victim of the cold case who is known by his last name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In the story, Coop is single, a veteran of the Vietnam War, with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are partners of the police force and form not only a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that both must hide from a deep and obviously homophobic culture that prevailed at that time. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks to their lives are mostly black and white, with bits of color occasionally splashed. Examples include his red patrol car, the yellow curtains that gently blow out the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife saw Coop and Jimmy drinking, fighting and then kissing while they were in an alcohol-induced state. I found it interesting that only the selected elements were colored in the flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I have not yet discovered the color scheme and the justification. <br /> <br /> The clearly homophobic tension between the official patrol companions and the two central actors only increases the intensity of the episode. A key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected officer of the force, confronts Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. At this point, one can feel sorry for Coop, as the shame and misfortune of Coop's father accumulated over Coop: "It's not going to dishonor our family ... and it's not my son either." - clearly indicative of the hostile opinions of same-sex relationships at that time. <br /> <br /> You can also see additional tension in the police locker room where Coop and another officer go after Coop and Jimmy are labeled "Batman and robin homos". <br /> <br /> As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once he can see the tension in Jimmy's face, as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and children, his church and, nonetheless, his unwavering devotion to Coop. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jimmy pulls away from Coop, realizing he can not have Coop and his family at the same time. Regrettably, Coop was killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop could also have been killed because of his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher in the force. <br /> <br /> The most touching scene In the whole episode was when Coop, while sitting on the verge of dying from gunshot wounds in his patrol car, spoke in a low voice his last words on police radio to his partner: "Jimmy ... we were the lucky ones, do not forget it." <br /> <br /> The selection of the soundtrack was outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with the actor Chad Everett, playing Jimmy, still afflicted, only now he is much older, and clearly still missed his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode and I consider it the best. It is undoubtedly the most well written, well acted and well done of all the episodes of Cold Case that I have seen.
