it reminds us of the writings of Stephen King and the remembered childhoods full of terror of stories like that of IT, as exactly the opposite. There is no terror in this childhood that any of the friends, who are still friends 20 years in the line, remember or seem to suffer. Until the end, everything is described as a friendly push, perhaps periodically described as "stinging" one or more of them, but all is forgiven. There is no * anguish * embedded since the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships; all we see is that young people have grown up to be basically the same people. More mature, but basically they are still the same people and the same structures of power. <br /> <br /> Totally incredible! Not only because people can, in fact, grow relatively unharmed by social conventions, but also by the fact that friendships can last. In this sense, this film is a small Pearl, as is supposed, this was the intention of the film: a portrait of unforced emotions that unite people. What, when seen in opposition to the films of later years that portray the dark sides of childhood, is what comes easily to mind the violent inhibitions in Bowling for Combine, but since the mid-80s along with the growing adoration of children and childhood (accompanied by thousands of commercials, animations and series directed directly at children) several films and documentaries have succeeded in portraying the dark sides of growth: abuse, loneliness, the urge to excel , resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds. /> <br /> And here comes a movie that says: It's possible to have a happy childhood, look! <br /> <br /> Thanks for that. Or the illusion of counterweight ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
