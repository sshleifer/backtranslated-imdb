To begin with, since this movie is a new version of a classic, the rating has already been reduced. Since this version is starring Viggo Mortensen in the main role of Kowalski, help. <br /> <br /> This is not like the government of the United States, to terrorize one of its own citizens. It sounds like the Jason Priestley character in the movie! But it is true, the government would do everything possible to destroy the life of a man by trying to get home with his wife. A wife, who is in labor, and can not do it. <br /> <br /> "There was a time in this country where the police escorted a man to his pregnant wife." The words of the Disc Jockey. <br /> <br /> In this movie there were some great images of the stage, and great car chases and a lot of spirituality. After much consideration, I gave this movie a 7.
