This is a story about Shin-ae, who moves to Milyang from Seoul with her young son Jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband. Her husband was born here, and she is opening a piano school, but she also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from death. If that was what the movie was about, it would probably have been like a Hollywood movie, with the possibility that she would fall in love with a local boy and be happy with her son in his new home. But, this is not hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and murdered, apparently because it is known that she has cash of the agreement. The grieving process, the attempts to move on, the attempts to cleanse her guilty conscience, are admirably done, and the lead actress is excellent. The only warning, and it must be said, is that it is a depressing movie. You have to know that when you enter. You want Shin-ae to go through his pain and find some happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, it is Korea and in Korean cinema, especially in drama, they make no effort. Life is what happens to you. Good acting, but sometimes a difficult movie to watch, due to events. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do that.
