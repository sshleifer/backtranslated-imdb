What is "Cry Freedom" like? It is simply an excellent and unique experience on how to make South Africa and how white people in that country were repressed by whites. The main character in the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor-in-chief of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, where he talks critically about the opinions of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon Woods meets Biko and he changes his mind about him and also begins to understand what the authorities are doing with the blacks in South Africa (from the top, even from the police chief). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides that he has to write a book about him and that it does not matter what he has to publish it. But Woods must escape from his country to publish that book and must also put his family in second place, so that the world can discover the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough managed to make a good film about people, with the main message that white and black are the same, because we are all people. The story takes us to South Africa and this (film) is an excellent way for everyone to learn what happened on that land and I am disappointed that only 3200 people have rated this movie. This is a movie from which we can all learn something. Although it is a little long, this story could not be presented more briefly because the director wanted to show us how difficult it was for Woods to publish that book after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Woods and Biko was also excellent, as were the families of those two people and all the problems they are going through. But sometimes you have to make sacrifices (Biko's death) so that the truth can be revealed (Woods's book).
