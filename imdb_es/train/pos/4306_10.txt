The mere fact that I still think about the movie a decade later is what really says a lot about the movie. For me, this justifies the Grand Canyon as a movie that will touch you in one way or another. I really believe that before the movie Crash there was Grand Canyon. The main difference between the two films in my opinion is the time of its release. I will not discuss which is better, but I will limit myself to the idea that they share the same message. I would love to hear from those who have an opinion on this subject. I'll start a comment you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to publish any other topic about movies that we can share, because I have a real love for the movie.
