"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and it was simple and direct. Actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic lighting, see something else. And it is not in any way a tear drop. But I say it in a positive way. It shows two men who love each other and how being affected by AIDS is affecting the quality of their daily lives. It is almost difficult for me to say if it was a quality film or not, because I was so naked that I had to find other ways to respond. It is an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable and sincere documents I have seen. These two men have incredible integrity, since their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It makes hollow wood productions about AIDS look like hips and without hearts. These men made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene in which Tom sings to Mark "You are my sun" and says goodbye is something real.
