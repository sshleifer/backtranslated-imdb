['This interesting documentary tells the extraordinary story of an expedition to take blind Tibetan children walking in the Himalayas; But also a clash of personalities between two notable people. On the one hand, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest, and the team of mountaineers (seers) who are guiding the children. On the other hand, there is Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for blind Tibetans, who agrees with the expedition but then has doubts about how she is progressing. On some level, Sabine simply does not understand the mountaineer&#39;s philosophy (with its emphasis on summits); He is probably right to identify the mismatch between the mountaineers&#39; goals and the children&#39;s wishes, but his certainty in his own correction makes him a difficult person to sympathize, especially because he has an effective veto. In the context of this shock (reasonably educated), we have an idea of the lives of the children themselves. I enjoyed the movie, although it conveys a message clearly designed to be edifying; Although it details the dispute, the film relentlessly affirms how amazing all those who appear in it are. But it is difficult to argue with that evaluation, even if it is presented to the viewer in a somewhat dubious way.']
