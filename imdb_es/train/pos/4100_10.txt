"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heiress betrothed to the son of an impoverished marquis, arrives at the crumbling castle of the family and learns from a mythical beast of the ursina that pretended to wander through the nearby forest. It's fabulous that a former lady of the house (Sirpa Lane) once had perverse sexual relations with the creature and Lucy is consumed by the dreams of the incident. "The Beast" is an artistic mix of surreal horror, explicit sleaze and porn. There is implied bestiality, assault and perversion in the priesthood, abundant false ejaculate spotted on naked breasts, masturbation with a rose and, most graphic of all, the beast of the same name that plays with an incredibly large phallus. Still, this genuinely erotic movie is wonderfully photographed and tasteless. The women here are incredibly beautiful and are naked most of the time. In general, "La Bête" is a visual feast. Whether it's fetishism, attention to detail, or visual motifs full of information, Borowczyk's masterpiece must be observed with care and attention. A must for fans of European cult movies.
