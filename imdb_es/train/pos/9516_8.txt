Tom Hanks like you've never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death." He is a hit man for his surrogate father John Rooney (Paul Newman), an old boss of the Irish Mafia. Sullivan's young son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses what his father does for a living and they are both on the road for seven weeks, robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and another son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer willing to kill Sullivan for the opportunity to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters. Filmed beautifully capturing the drama of life in the 30s. Sometimes the rhythm gets stuck, but then an explosion of graphic violence sustains the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and the union of a secret man and his young son. Other notable cast members include: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks is again excellent in a memorable film. Make space for some Oscars!
