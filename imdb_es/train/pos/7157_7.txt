['This movie is an entertaining, fun and quality film. The film follows the guidelines of the book very intelligently and tries to follow the exact lines. The actors are all suitable, and you would expect them to be the part. They use some famous actors that give a great effect in the movie. The graphics are a bit confusing in some parts, and there are some errors throughout the movie. There is no such thing as a yellow spotted lizard, for example. The camp is not as frightening as explained in the book, and they tend not to show events in the camp as well as in the book. His whole group is mentioned a lot in the book, but they are not in the film. In general, a great movie for a rainy afternoon.']
