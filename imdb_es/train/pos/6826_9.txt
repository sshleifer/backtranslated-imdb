The "Opening Night" by John Cassavetes is fantastic and fascinating; Fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination, fascinating because it never ceases to amaze us. With its long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, anyone who appreciates the characters will not be able to look away from the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of an unstable actress, Myrtle Gordon, (Gena Rowlands) trying to arm herself for a play, fighting her demons; "Opening Night" is not only about a woman on the verge of a crisis, but also about the complexities of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world. All the characters of Cassavetes here are experienced people who know the world of theater; So half of the film takes place on a stage, either where the artists do their work or in the backstage, where the producers, writers and directors do their work. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes is so hard on his characters that this cruelty is directed towards the public, but the audience at the cinema. Because there is another audience, in the theater of the film, who does not know what is really happening and laughs because they think that everything is performance. And that is essentially what it is; it's just that the audience in the theater does not get to see 'backstage' like us. They do not experience the exuberance of Gena Rowlands before going out to that stage, but the most important thing is that; They do not know the reasons why she acts as she does. <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be hard to be friends with an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) says she is an actress and that's the only thing she knows how to do; and I imagine that if I had a friend who was a professional interpreter, it would be very difficult to know when he is telling the truth because he would know that he is an actor and can pretend anything at any time. Many of the things that Myrtle does during the terrible experiences that the film goes through? We suspect if it is being real; The rest of the characters also suspect. <br /> <br /> There is the writer, Sarah (Joan Blondell), who can not understand why Myrtle does not understand the character she has written for her. There is the director, Manny (Ben Gazzara), who can not accept the fact that his best actress could be losing him; the producer David (Paul Stewart) who does not know where to stand and the co-star of Myrtle, Maurice (the same Cassavetes), who can not deal with the love they have for each other. <br /> <br /> When she witnesses the death of a teenager, a fan; all this comes together and affects Myrtle, but nobody knows if their delusions are real. They do not say anything because they do not want to bother her, but the film enters a state of subconsciousness that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes, we can say that everyone has had it. During these moments, the brilliant script of Cassavetes shows a terrifying brutal honesty in the words that the characters say in a discussion behind the scenes; and not only what everyone tells Myrtle, but also what she tells them. <br /> <br /> Here are people who are not afraid to say what they think and constantly change what they are thinking, just like the way Cassavetes makes movies. . And in this aspect, the performances are more important here than in "Sombras", because the characters are involved in a larger image; a bigger story that comes out of the trivial. <br /> <br /> But in another aspect, the real way of making movies, this movie is not different from "Shadows". There is a beautiful thing in the way that Al Ruban's camera shoots the characters. When someone is talking, the camera does not focus on him, he shoots the person who is listening; so we can see how he or she reacts to the things that the other person says. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes devastated. <br /> <br /> The improvisation could still be there, however, among all these wonderful performances. Near the end, there is an unexpected scene where Cassavetes and Rowlands begin to talk, non-stop. Whether this was improvised or not is something we have to ask ourselves. We just have to look; and seeing them exchange life experiences and see that words come alive in a conversation that means much more than what is shown, there is nothing more natural than that.
