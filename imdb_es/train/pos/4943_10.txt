This is making movies in their simplest and best form. <br /> <br /> I had my doubts, because although Freeman is a great actor, sometimes he gets involved in bad projects; This is not one of those occasions. <br /> <br /> It's a little story that takes place in just over an hour and fifteen, at a time when we're getting used to movies getting longer and longer, and not necessarily better. The director uses the short time to his advantage, because the characters are so well defined from the beginning (by the way, the great portraits of Freeman and Vega), that the little background information about them seems real, Morgan is himself his name is not mentioned, he has been out of the movies for a couple of years because he was saturated by the business and developed a fear of committing to a script, and is investigating a character in an independent film where he plays a manager store / supermarket. The story begins when he dropped into a supermarket in a difficult neighborhood, where he meets the cashier of 10 items or less (Vega) and has to take a walk with his cause "the production" forgot to pick it up. <br /> <br /> In many ways, it's a road movie, Morgan provides laughter and quirks with his unmatched smile and positive outlook on everything, showing an accomplished actor who has trained his mind to be able to define all that she sees in a character she could interpret, and Paz (by the way, what an extraordinarily beautiful woman, even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of a 25-year-old woman who works harder than anyone else without getting credit in a dead end job in a fucking supermarket. <br /> <br /> It's a talkie, there's a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well sustained, the characters become so friendly immediately that they spend the last 20 minutes asking for more screen time de thi It's a strange couple, but the difficulty is in the nature of the story, so it was a good decision of the director not to give up.
