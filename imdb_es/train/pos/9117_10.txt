['This film gives us an interesting reminder of how easy it is for many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing. We, as Afro-descendants, owe it to ourselves to make a change in this cycle of &quot;talking and not acting&quot; and to begin to realize that to make a change, it is necessary that there be less conversation and more action. It&#39;s a powerful statement of our people&#39;s divisions about small problems, and our failures to recognize the big picture and the need to unite to make a difference ... Despite their reference to the black community, all viewers can learn something . From the message that this film seeks to portray.']
