The children, ages 7 to 14, enjoyed this movie so much that we gave a copy to all the other children on our birthday list this year. Everyone loved it! Children from 2 to 7 years old see it repeatedly and frequently, and we like to see it with them. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to entertain children for so long and to offer laughter for adults. as well. Most enjoy it more than the first. <br /> <br /> High quality production and an excellent cast, directed by Christopher Showerman as a superior George: athletic, energetic and totally believable, with a kind innocence and a particularity. The ability to take a tree in the face, well supported by the inimitable Christina Pickles as the evil mother-in-law, the Thomas Haden church as the idiot rival, and everyone else. This is fun.
