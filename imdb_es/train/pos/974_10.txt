One of the best directors of Miike Takashi. It's so good that it's hard to put into words. With almost fifteen years more than the target audience, I was thrilled from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Remember similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) those films were not afraid to scare ... There are many unpleasant details here that I initially found jarring, but soon I realized that it is nothing different than what I grew up. The film is a compilation of the conventions of children's films of the 80s. Whatever it is, it's there: a young hero pushed from his own unhappy / dysfunctional world to another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; a beautiful heroine he is in love with; a sadistic henchwoman (Go-Go Yubari of Kill Bill Vol. 1); a leading villain who extracts his evil power from something that everyone can relate to. But all these gender conventions have a new twist and a greater depth. <br /> <br /> One of the IMDb reviews begins "Where was this movie when I was a kid?" and it is a feeling with which I agree. Even as I looked at him I regretted the fact that I had not grown up in that; that was not part of my childhood as Labyrinth, Masters Of The Universe and, to a lesser extent, The Neverending Story. Those films, and others like The Goonies are remembered, but never copied. Miike tirelessly offers us a new version. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is a staple of many of his films, sometimes due to budget constraints, but only so often an artistic choice - the desire to present things in an extravagant way. Here, the CGI is mostly average, due solely to budget constraints, but nevertheless, it does a fantastic job of putting on a show. The CG effects are combined with traditional puppets, animatronics and a truly extraordinary makeup to create a world full of rich characters (and characterization) that often borders the visionary. <br /> <br /> This is ranked as one of the best children. movies never made. However, it is not for younger or more sensitive children. <br /> <br /> Simply amazing. See for yourself and if you think your children can handle / appreciate it, teach it. Let them grow in The Great Yokai War as a small compensation for the fact that you could not.
