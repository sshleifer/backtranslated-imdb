Heres a funny fact, I was the baby in the movie, the one in the crib. :) I am 19 years old now. My parents took me to try the paper, we lived in Texas at that time. I think I only won about $ 80, but I was not long in that. My parents said that I would cry when I was supposed to be happy and that I would be happy when I was supposed to cry. I was all mixed. A strange and funny fact, I suppose ... and no, I'm not a child actress. I am living in San Antonio, working in a walgreens. I graduated here in Texas but I lived in Maryland most of my life. This movie is a great movie, however, good concept. I have seen it several times in my short 19 years.
