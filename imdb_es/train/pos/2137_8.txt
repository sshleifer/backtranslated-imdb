This is much more than the charming story of a middle-aged man who discovers the pleasures of ballroom dancing (although he is). It is the story of a person who learned to love life again, overcoming all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once again. The advantage of this film is a fascinating insight into the changing attitudes of modern Japan towards everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... some in which you will want to get up and dance tango ... and many others in which you will feel good. <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese cinema for those who have the impression that all Japanese films are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
