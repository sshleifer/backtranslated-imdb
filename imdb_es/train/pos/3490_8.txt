This movie was pretty good. The acting was great, and there were some really cool actors like Buchholz and Roger Moore. This movie is full of surprises. Confusing sometimes ... yes, but the twists and turns of the plot always keep you in suspense. The only thing this film had too much about was the explosion of cars.
