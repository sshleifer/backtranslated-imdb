Wrestlemania 14 is not often seen as one of the best Wrestlemania, but personally I would put it in my top 5, if not in the top 3. It has so many great things, and it really meant the birth of The Attitude Era, which was The Best It was WWE, in my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion, and he, putting Austin as he did, when leaving, was pure class on his part. It has one of the hottest crowds you'll ever see, and it has J.R and The King at its best ad. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? Team battle royal LOUD pop for the return of L.O.D. I'm not a fan of the real battle, and this is another average. Very predictable, even when you see it for the first time, it is obvious that L.O.D would win. Watching Sunny for 8 minutes or so definitely helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka receives a surprising pop, with his input. Fast, high-flying and very exciting. If these two had more time, surely they would have torn the roof with their things. Taka wins with the pilot Michinoku. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here, is that Chyna is handcuffed to Slaughter. Good pop for Owen, mixed reaction for Trips. A very, really underestimated match, which is among one of my favorites for Wrestlemania, really. The two mixed very well, and Owen can go with anyone. The trips win, with the interference of Chyna. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed label combination. Marc Mero & Sable Vs Goldust & Luna. Defining pop for Sable, unpublished of that time, for women. Sable looks really sexy, and the crowd is eating it! Constant Sable sings, and explodes almost every time she enters the ring. Not bad for a mixed-label match, he had entertaining antics and he spent good time. Sable's team wins, when Sable hits the TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock | C |. Before reviewing the game, I would like to point out that The Rock showed its immense potential, with its interview with Jennifer Flowers, before his game. Good pop for Shamrock, great heat for The Rock. Too disappointingly short, and I thought the ending was a bit stupid, though Shamrock's incredible antics were incredible to watch, and the crowd went crazy over that. Rock retains the title when The Ref reverses the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Dumpster match, for the WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws. The Outlaws are not as finished as they would be at this moment. The crowd is actually a little dead from this, but I thought I had some big bits of Hardcore, with some bumps that looked sick. Cactus and Terry win the titles at the end. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs Kane. Great ovation, for The Undertaker. It was much better than taking a field trip at Wrestlemania 20, and for a big man vs. big man game, this was really good. It was a great fight, with The Undertaker crossing the table through a table. WWE was smart, making Kane look strong, even through defeat. After 2 kicks of tombstone, Taker finally drives him away, with a third. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Enforcer special guest "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. The crowd goes to Austin, definitely one of the biggest pop I've heard. Mixed reaction, for HBK. This is really a special combination, one of the most important events in wrestlemania in history, it can be said when J.R is out of breath. HBK gives it all, in what was supposed to be his last game, and Austin has rarely been better. The animosity and the electricity of the crowd is incredible, and it is as exciting as it looks. Austin wins with the stunner, with Tyson joining 3:16 to knock out Michaels. The celebration of Austin's victory is a wonder, because with one of the noisiest crowds I've ever seen, King said it correctly, they were going crazy. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the best ones really. It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania, and it really started the Age of Attitude. This is very special to me, because it was the first Wrestlemania I saw in 98. "The Austin Age has begun!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
