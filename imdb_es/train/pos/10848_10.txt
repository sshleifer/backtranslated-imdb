['... Heads, Hands, and Feet - a band from the past, like Strange Fruit. A triple blow there. Those who have professed that they do not like this movie are discouraged or under 40 years old, and have not had the real experience. Sorry for them This is a small, very well observed image, which is an excellent way to spend an hour or two, and probably will not even fade very much in the second presentation. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as the fat drummer (in many ways he is the most charming figure of all), and Bill Nighy, a new name for me, since the neurotic vocalist and the leader become super performances, and Juliet Aubrey has a beautiful I hope I&#39;ll go with Karen, who tries to keep the band together while spectacularly self-destructing. <br /><br /> The echoes of Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson are loud and clear, Mott the Hoople rises before one in all its inflated ridicule, and the script is never inaccurate for more than a minute. Do not compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty, it&#39;s unfair to all of them. The closest comparison is Commitments, and that&#39;s not bad. And any movie that can conjure up memories of Blodwyn Pig, a band I do not remember ever seeing, but the name lingers, well, it shows that someone on the team knew what it was about. <br /><br /> A little delight, and thanks for the memory. <br /><br /> Oh ... and I have another one - Stiff Little Fingers; aa-y what about SteelEYE Span ... Spooky tooth ... Ten inches NAILS to someone? (You have to see the movie or have been on the road)']
