This movie is a wonderfully simplistic work. Pleasant from start to finish, it is both sad and encouraging at the same time. The performances of Miranda Otto (oh, how she deserves much more recognition!) And George del Hoya are beautiful and almost painful to watch, as the two tortured souls come to understand each other. The cast of Dead Letter Office workers are wonderful parts in themselves, just like Alice's boyfriend, I could not help but feel a bit of grief. There is a particular scene that I can see again and again (and I have it!), It's a pity that films like these do not receive recognition and, therefore, bring them to the public so that more people can enjoy them. I cried, I laughed and sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
