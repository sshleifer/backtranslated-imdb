The beating of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to chaos theory, I'm not sure how), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, will initiate a chain reaction that can lead to great events. This little gem of a movie shows us a series of apparently unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect the lives of others. (The theory of the six degrees of separation can also be applied). Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this movie. The performance is well tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is luminous), the stories fit in a plausible way, the humor is fair and the viewer leaves the theater nodding.
