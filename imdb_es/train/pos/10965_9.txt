Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for. Even though your house was dirty, this is understandable considering your mental illness. On the message board, a poster wrote that "Little Edie has the coping skills of an eight-year-old child." This reminded me when in the dramatized version of 2009, Big Edie tells Little Edie: "If you're stuck, it's just with yourself!" These women had everything; Beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and actions. Maybe if Little Edie was not so hard on herself the first time things did not work, losing her hair, her job and the love of her life, she would have succeeded. In some way, this is related to what I think is your mental illness: your inability to recover when times are difficult and to see that good times are coming. The world will never know what happened if she did not listen to her mother's plea: "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> However, these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be. Bright, heartbreaking and friendly, even in your extremely dirty home. These women were extraordinary, and their interaction between them brings humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional crises, thinking about what could have been, or how she wants to leave home because she feels like a little girl, one feels the intense need to embrace her and tell her that "everything will do". Be good! "<br /> <br /> Great documentary! <br /> <br /> 9/10
