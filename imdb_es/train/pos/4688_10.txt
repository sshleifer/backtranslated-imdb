I showed this to my sixth grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it. I loved it too. The history of termites and their interaction with their environment is incredible. The cast of creatures is deep and everyone plays their part well. The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is a truly classic image. <br /> <br /> Alan Root has done an incredible job with the camera and this should have won the Oscar for Best Documentary. The copy I have does not have Orson Welles narrating it (Derek Jacobi) and it is not called "The mysterious clay castles", only "Castles of clay". This makes me think that it must have been done with Welles added for the power of the stars and an Oscar push. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to find this VHS recently and now it is my children's favorite movie. They took him to the last family reunion instead of a Disney movie. If you can find this movie you're lucky.
