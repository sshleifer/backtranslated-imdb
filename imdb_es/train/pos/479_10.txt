The natalia of Emily Watson is absolutely the most loving and romantic protagonist that I have seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film beyond all doubt. Or, is the king transmuted? The internal fabric of chess games and the struggles of families for control, power and victory are impressive. Like the chess masters in the film, the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at the same time, but all are intertwined in major or minor patterns. The period, costumes and images of the Lake District of Italy at the beginning of the 20th century are captured magnificently. Not a single square of space is wasted. <br /> <br /> So many bright scenes abound, I can not count them all. I recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice, possibly a week apart, since I may not be able to capture all the poetry within a multidimensional frame of 64 squares in one configuration. <br /> <br /> I did not read Nabakov's book, but to prove my own analogy, what I'm reading reminds me of another romantically triumphant poetry-as-game movie, The Natural, by Barry Levinson. He completely dismissed the negative ending of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director did that better by perfectly combining the morale and the Russian and Italian customs as a backdrop for the lighting. The real story here is that the games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both contestants draw. But, in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by those restrictions and the conventions of life insofar as we allow others to break our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, as impersonated by Emily Watson's Natalia, can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by her gifts simultaneously. Only the barriers erected by our fears can separate us. <br /> <br /> This is a magnificent movie (10/10).
