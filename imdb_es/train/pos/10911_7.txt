I enjoyed this 1936 film with many veteran classical actors and, especially, William Powell, (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", who played the role of doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was married to Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), "Shane", he got divorced and they still managed to live together and also fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything possible to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a pretty nutty guy and there's a lot of Comedy from 1936 and the murder method is something you'll never believe, especially with a rider on a California race track. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) "King Kong" gave a great supporting role as bookmaker along with James Gleason, a detective who needs the help of Dr. Bradford to solve this strange mystery of murder. If you watch this movie, remember that it was produced and directed in 1936 and people in the audience in those days thought that this was great entertainment and that it really was in Those Days.
