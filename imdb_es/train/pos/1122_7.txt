Four teenage girl friends drive to Fort Laurdale for spring break. Unfortunately, they have a puncture in Medley, Georgia, and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder in the woods. The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... "Shallow Grave" is a pleasant low budget surprise. The cast is quite nice, the direction is stable and the violence is particularly unpleasant and misogynistic. Especially the second murder is pretty grim. The killer sheriff is not a one-dimensional character. A couple of scenes seem to feel remorse for what he has done. The secondary plot that involves the two children who are in the restaurant does not lead anywhere, but the scenes of stalking in the forest are tense and exciting.7 out of 10.
