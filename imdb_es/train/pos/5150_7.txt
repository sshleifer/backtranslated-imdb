Although Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in Hitler's life and yes, this is dramatized, but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his last years, during this documentary that only deals with Hitler from childhood until he became Chancellor of Germany, including The Night of the Long Knives. This TV movie (also a two-part miniseries) shows how a number of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, for example. The financial disaster of 1930. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and little else, apart from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, valuable and full of interesting actors, however, I think I should have been more closely directed with a stronger cinematography; most of the actors are portrayed in half-length shots that (for me) constitute a theatrical stance, not cinematographic. The rhythm is sometimes sleepy, and the film suffers from it, as it lasts about 2.5 hours.
