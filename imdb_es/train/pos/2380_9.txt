I did not mind walking all the time. People really walked by places back then. It lends an air of authenticity to this piece of time and a perspective on the technology of the Martians. I was also disappointed with the effects, particularly the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider one of the most exciting in the book. But I can not praise this movie enough, for its fidelity to the story of Wells! It's time. The actors are friendly and the performances are charming. It is also worth watching this movie just to listen to the truly great music of Jamie Hall. It was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in London.
