A couple (Janet and Richard) go camping in the forest near a giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes refuge in what they believe is an abandoned farm. Soon, a couple of fugitive convicts appear and, after much delay of the inevitable, proceed to rape Janet and lock Richard in a cage. <br /> <br /> This last film on the left has to be One of the most underestimated horror movies ever made. It is one of the shockers of the early 70's most sick and twisted. In addition, I found that this was quite charming and beautiful in its perverse tone. I love the TERROR CAJADO. The music definitely helps to give a sense of personality to the film, as well as a lot of beauty. I found that the movie is pretty creepy. <br /> <br /> The faults have to do mainly with the pace of the movie, which means that the movie is quite slow and meandering. While I did not care about the pace due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question, I think most people will. The performance is not too good nor the dialogue, at least in the first scenes. This movie requires a little more patience than usual, and it really is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In summary, it was a good movie. It's not the best horror movie I've seen in my life, but it's certainly very funny. It is not exactly the easiest movie to find. It is possible to find it in the UTILIZED section of many stores if you look closely enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a junk movie fan, it's definitely worth checking out.
