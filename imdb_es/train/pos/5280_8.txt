Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan descent. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. Out of nowhere, his father announces that Reda will take him to the Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca, something that Reda has no interest in doing, but accepts only by obligation. As a result, from the beginning, Reda is angry, but being a traditional Muslim, it is difficult to talk to her father or discuss her doubts. Both father and son seem to be very rigid and inflexible, and it is very ironic when the father tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, it talks about how much the characters grew up and started getting to know each other. However, I really do not think they did and that is the fascinating and sad aspect of the movie. Sure, there were moments of understanding, but there was often an underlying current of hostility and repression. In fact, I liked this and I appreciated that there was not a complete resolution of this, since it would have seemed false. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is well acted and fascinating, which gives Westerners an unusual perspective on Islam. and the Hajj. It also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional Islam and the younger secular generation. While the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film can upset some, I think it gave an intense realism to the film and made it look like a movie about people, not a formula. A beautiful and unusual movie.
