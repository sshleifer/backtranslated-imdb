After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally ends up inside an invisible ink bottle, which was part of a chemistry game. He quickly discovers that he is invisible ... so predictable results are produced, which means he uses his new hidden condition to torment Tom. Jerry often defends himself, but often has a sadistic streak that torments the cat whenever possible, even when it is not provoked. <br /> <br /> Here, it makes Tom think that his eyes are cheating him when the cheese of a mousetrap disappears before his eyes, or the milk of a dish. Tom can not take it anymore, so try to sleep this nightmare, but Jerry sets fire to his leg! Man, I hope that young children have no ideas watching these cartoons in the 40s and 50s! I always found Jerry, the little mouse, more evil than cute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in cartoons, in general, any damage suffered by a character disappears in seconds and returns to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this caricature is about two thirds of the way when Tom realizes what the story is with Jerry and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is (how to put flour). on the ground to see his tracks).
