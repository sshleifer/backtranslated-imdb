This film is inspiring for anyone who is or has been in a difficult situation, financially or emotionally. You will definitely laugh, which is the best medicine! :) Being in a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace has to find a new way to earn some money and it is not exactly legal what adds to the humor. Even my boyfriend liked it, so do not think it's a chick.
