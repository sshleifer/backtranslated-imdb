Film really amazing, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening. A very overpopulated world, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer, and all our natural resources spent. In this degenerate nightmarish society, we have the great Charlton Heston as a sympathetic Noirish style detective of films trying to discover the truth behind a murder, in front of the legend of the black film Edward G Robinson, who is turning into an excellent last performance . <br /> <br /> One of the images that will always stay with me from this movie, are the masses of people that populate the stairs and the way Thorne (Heston) has to jump through them every time uses. <br /> <br /> The use of the music of the film is also worth mentioning, although it does not contain scores in the usual sense. The opening theme is good and the subsequent music fragments that we have here in the Simonson department, and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic, are outstanding. atmospheric.
