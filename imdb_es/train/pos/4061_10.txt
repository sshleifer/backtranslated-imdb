This is the best dub I've heard of Disney, as well as the best adaptation from the biggest abuse in soundtracks, themes, characters, dialogues in the Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation of the common heroine. This one has hero and heroine (although I do not really support the use of hero and heroin here, since Miyazaki is outside of the common theme and stereotype). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited, astonished by Mononoke, concerned about Grave of Fireflies and deeply moved by Majo no Takkyuubin, this start with a bit of doubt on my part. Wondering if this will be Ghibi's first failure. Well, in the end, like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 points. It would give a rating of 9.8, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie, people die in this, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction. It is as if humanity really could not live with too much power. The collapse scene gave me patches from the end of Metropolis. It's sad somehow. The plot is evident in most reviews and the rules of the soundtrack as well (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber. People who can bring a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a prolonged moment for an amazing composition. <br /> <br /> This is a feeling of well-being. Film that used to be part of the American cinema in the classic days (It's a wonderful life, etc., etc.). Well, things change ...
