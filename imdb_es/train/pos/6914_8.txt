['This film contains one of the best performances of Richard Dreyfuss, as an actor who plays a dictator and does so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor. Also, this movie is fun, but it also has a serious side. What is especially interesting about this movie is the character Madonna, who is the dictator&#39;s lover, but who eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna&#39;s evolution from the lady to the political leader contributed greatly to the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who at the beginning of the film is an actor with problems and something like a buffoon, also evolves and, at the end of the film, demands respect. I liked this movie.']
