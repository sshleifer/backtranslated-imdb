This is the best of Shelley Duvall's high-quality "Faerie Tale Theater" series. The ugly stepsisters are a relief from the Broadway quality comedy, and Eve Arden is the personification of the evil stepmother. Jennifer Beals does an excellent job as a straight Cinderella, especially in the garden scene with the Charming Prince of Matthew Broderick. Jean Stapleton plays the fairy godmother well, although I'm not sure that I liked the characterization of "lady of the south" with some of the lines. The relief of Steve Martin's comedy as director of the Royal Orchestra is Martin par excellence, but a little out of place in the flow of the program. <br /> <br /> As usual in the series, there are several ironic comments for older children (over 15 years old). With a couple of small bumps, the show flows well and they live happily ever after. Children up to 8 years old will continue to see it after the parents have finally grown tired of it. I discovered that 3 times in a day is too much.
