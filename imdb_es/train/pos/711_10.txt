"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably have to go down in history as the best movie of the rebel party. By portraying a group of high school students who use the music of the Ramones as inspiration to confront their despotic director (Mary Woronov, of the fame of "Eating Raoul"), the whole movie is one mile per minute. It's basically a great excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you will. First year students harassed? Check. A dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also from "Eating Raoul" *)? Check. The mice that explode? Checkmate. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is the kind of things that make life worthwhile. Even for someone like me who does not know the music of the Ramones, it's pure pleasure. With the executive production of Roger Corman and the co-direction of Joe Dante, how can we expect anything less? Too bad that director Allan Arkush later degenerated into rates like "Caddyshack II". <br /> <br /> Also starring PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who has appeared in each of Joe Dante's films and many by Roger Corman), Don Steele and, Of course, the Ramones. A real pleasure. <br /> <br /> * It seems that Bartel and Woronov are always stars. They also co-starred in Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and the slasher movie "Chopping Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... in which they repeated their "Eating Raoul" roles.
