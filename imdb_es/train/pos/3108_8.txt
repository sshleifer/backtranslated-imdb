This delivery makes the CIA look like a very silly organization. Actually, maybe they are. After all, the way the plot unfolds is very similar to that of a man who has the power to punish everyone, including his own people, to kill Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon does a very credible job As Bourne tries to stay one step ahead of being killed in the whole movie. He is still trying to remember who he was and how he got where he is. He gets help from a couple of people and it seems that every minute of the movie, someone is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is little time to rest in this movie and the action sequences seem very real. . There are many chase sequences recorded with the camera unstable that, in some way, increase the realism and make it look less Hollywood than many images. These sequences add realism to the film in the feeling. <br /> <br /> The suspense in some of the sequences is done brilliantly while you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can avoid it. This is the kind of action and suspense that he visits when he wants to be entertained and I'm sure this will be the next movie in the series.
