['In the old blank audio cassette ad, the line on the label was &quot;Is it real or is it Memorex?&quot; The same could be said for the events of this episode: a compilation and remix of &quot;The Cage&quot;, the first Star Trek pilot. Spock has skillfully asked the ship to take her to the forbidden planet Talos IV to allow Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain burned and paralyzed, to return there. Why the finagling? Because having some contact with Talos IV invites a death sentence. Why this is so is never explained, which bothered me greatly, but, as nothing, adds to the story. After he got the ship to travel to Talos IV, Mr. Spock surrenders to Dr. McCoy (the highest ranking officer present, Captain Kirk was off the ship) for the arrest and says: &quot;The charge is a riot. , Dr. &quot;I never received orders to take the ship.&quot; What follows is a court martial in which, thanks to the Talosians, we learn why it was so important (apart from the obvious paralysis) that Captain Pike arrived in Talos. IV even at the risk of Mr. Spock&#39;s death, the illusions that the Talosians create, the background music and the whole story are fantastic, and Meg Wyllie as The Keeper (the Talosian boss) is wonderful, call me sexist, but I never know I happened to have a woman in that role, but it was perfect! The Talosians, who have abandoned almost all physical activity and have become almost completely dependent on the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can not really tell if they are men or women and it really does not matter. isodio, more than almost any other in the series, makes me wait and pray that there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so advanced! What a good thing if this were so! This is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times I&#39;ve seen it (I even have it in the video), it never fascinates me. Meg Wyllie looks like an alien and I do not mean that in an unpleasant way.']
