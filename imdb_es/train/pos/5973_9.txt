This is a great and ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid-to-late-80s obsession with the evil metal music it was supposed to be. I remember that the metal teenagers scared me when I was a kid. It does not help that I found a desecrated grave in the cemetery of my hometown when I was ten years old. It turns out that this strange metal boy had dug up some old bodies and used his bones in a strange sacrifice for satan. So maybe things like I was dissuaded from the metal for a while, but now I love it, like a 24 year old. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD that was used for $ 6 and I expected it to stink because of the scant cover, but to my surprise, it ruled it. It is about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you have to love a scene where a guitar shoots the lazers and vaporizes the headbangers in the crowd. This movie is amazing, if you like the metal of the 80s and the bad movies, this is for you. 9/10!
