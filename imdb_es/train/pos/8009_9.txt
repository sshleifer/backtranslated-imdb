Oh, the true memories. He lived in Holland at that time and waited anxiously every Sunday night and later on Tuesday. I saw him during my 14-16s. Very good for me (at the time of school) English, since Dutch television offers subtitles for other languages, except for children's programs nowadays. So you would listen to the original voices and language. - The best series were the first three and then, after the third, the great character, Nazi Von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (I do not think he was really caught, he always escaped, leaving room for to appear again in an upcoming story) because obviously the series was also distributed to Germany, and a Nazi enemy would not do very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful and convincing job portraying the clever Nazi aristocrat, who had this obsession with taking revenge on England. It was a real pleasure to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the young people were very normal. They were very believable to me at that time and when I was a child I could imagine that I was part of these young people, who at that time were about four years older than me. It was a very exciting series for me, standing out in my memory of those times as a special program with "The Prisoner" as well. I hope they publish a good quality DVD of the series, that would be wonderful. Even bad copies around are still nice to see. The last series were not as good, watered down and not as fun as the first three. We hope that you will also find other series with Von Gelb on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
