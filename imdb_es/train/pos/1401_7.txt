['Well, we have Verhoeven&#39;s extreme violence (although not as extreme as other Verhoeven movies), we have a lot of sex and naked, but something is missing ... Oh, yes, it lacks the intelligence that Paul Verhoeven is known for in his films Science fiction. I admire the way Verhoeven presents the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the film itself does not have enough humor to make it into the genre of comedy. The overall performance was above average compared to most of the Slasher films. <br /><br /> What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not the story, the cast or the characters, but the incredible work of special effects that would otherwise make a movie like this impossible. The team has really made an invisible man, without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on the piano wires and other practical effects (effects performed on the set). The most impressive effects scenes are not seen while Kevin Bacon is invisible, is when Kevin Bacon is becoming invisible and visible. <br /><br /> The problem is that this invisible history of man deserves to be more imaginative. Here, it is carried out in a laboratory for the most part. I would have liked to see the invisible Kevin Bacon stealing a bank and getting away with it, or let&#39;s say he steals something from people&#39;s wallets, or something like that. But what is shown is decent enough to make Hollow Man an entertaining movie. Grade B']
