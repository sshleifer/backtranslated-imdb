Let's eliminate any discussion about the use of non-Asian actors who play Asian roles. The movie is 67 years old. In 1937, studio leaders believed that any actor could / should be able to play any role. The actors had contracts, and they did not always have an option on what role they played. End of story. <br /> <br /> This is really a great epic story of love, individual rights, class strata and problems of men and women. The centerpiece of the film are two brilliant performances by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays Wang, a Chinese farmer, who is about to take a wife (Rainer). From the beginning, he treated her with respect, during a time when women were considered as little more than hired help. Without revealing too much of the film, they go through the ups and downs of all relationships, and although the story may take place in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the story and much of their feelings seem credible. <Br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the film is about 5 to 10 minutes longer than necessary, and the performances of Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly are typical characters of the 1930s cartoons, this is a really wonderful movie that, unfortunately, has become a victim of political correctness. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
