Big fun. I went with 8 friends to a preview of this movie. We came to see a different one, but after 10 minutes asking us what the hell we went into this time, the jokes became fun and they stayed comical throughout the movie. In the first part, just keep asking about these things 'malinski' and 'bellini' (there are many more examples of this jargon) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different turns) they become more fun. In the search for this malinski, all the main characters are introduced, the first one is even weirder than the next. Until the half of the movie was over, we did not even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we watched this furtive vision, but we had a great time. The house was loaded (approximately 250 people) and I think that almost half of them did not like it and the other half loved the movie. If you like strange comic movies with a great dialogue, you will love it. Apart from Clooney, this film deserves much more than the 5.6 IMDB rating I had at the time I write this, but when more people have seen it, I'm sure it will increase. 7.0 is reasonable, I suppose, I would give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
