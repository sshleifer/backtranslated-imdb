An authentic situation comedy farce from the mid 70's. This movie was a BIG success for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I am constantly surprised by some comedy movies that are a great release a week and then fade away: HIGH ANXIETY, THE CHEAPEST DETECTIVE, THE BLACK BIRD, DO NOT LOOK AT HIMSELF, WE ARE DISPERSED .......... and they have no profile at all today. NORMAN was the comedy of the month in 1976 and everyone seemed to see her, laugh at her and never mention her again. Famous for being filmed on a videotape and transferred to a movie, an experiment at the time, NORMAN is a scandalous and politically incorrect farce that The Farrelly Brothers should see today. If they had done so in the first place, there would be no complaints about their content and inclination. It's very funny and YES very rude and graciously all wrong. As it should be. In fact, like a wonderful 1976 film with all those colors and horror clothes, nowadays it works better.
