['&quot;Danza Macabra&quot; / &quot;Castillo de sangre&quot; by Antonio Margheriti is a chilling and atmospheric cooler that triumphs on all fronts. It looks absolutely beautiful in black and white and has a wonderfully spooky gothic feel. Alan Foster is an English journalist looking for an interview. with the visiting American horror writer Edgar Allan Poe. The enemy bets Foster for not being able to spend a night in the abandoned mansion of Poe&#39;s friend, Thomas Blackwood. Accepting the bet, Foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins! The film is extremely atmospheric and it scared me very much. The sequence of the crypts is really creepy and the tension is almost unbearable. Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful like the sinister spectator Elisabeth Blackwood. &quot;Castle of Blood&quot; is easily one of the best Italian horror movies made in the early 60s. A masterpiece!']
