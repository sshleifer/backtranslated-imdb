Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you only watch for fun. It is not a comfortable experience, although it does have some moments of laughter out loud. This is a movie you see when you need something to reflect on. <br /> <br /> To dismiss this film as simply racist is to lose the point altogether. This is not just a satire of Song of the South, but also a scathing comment on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group represented in the film is shown as grotesque caricatures of its stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the filmmaker shows how absurd these closely held beliefs really are. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who is willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevailing prejudices of the American culture, and if you are not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eyes, this movie may be for you .
