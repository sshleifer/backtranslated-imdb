I agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza, was the best voice that God had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go to Hollywood, go to the opera, it could have been the American Caruso, everyone says it could have been, but in any case is a fantastic introduction to the art form that has nothing to do with it and, if so, so it will be. See the movie You'll see why Mr. Lanza keeps arguing even at my house. Someone says Pavarotti, I say MARIO LANZA. As for the movie itself, when it will be on a DVD, it must be restored and VHS is not good enough, but this should also be the only Lanza movie that was put on DVD. boring .
