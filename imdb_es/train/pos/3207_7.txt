Of course, by any standard of film criticism, Soldier is a very poor movie. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised from birth to murder, but then became obsolete after being overtaken by a group of super soldiers in a ring that looks a bit like a Gladiator contest without the mats. <br /> <br /> Abandoned on a trash planet, he has befriended a community of space hippies who teach him about gardening, family life and, of course, breasts. Kurt does not talk much. Finally, the super soldiers approach and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they are fleeing. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet is totalized. End. <br /> <br /> Unless the Academy starts a new category for "Best Explosion", Soldier will not win any prize. However, ridiculous as it is, it is still a pleasant experience. The military equipment is the best, since Aliens (especially those of APC) and, with 90 minutes of duration, does not miss the welcome. Keep in mind that the brand below is only a guide. Remove five points if you want to take it seriously and discount one more if you do not like miniguns. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
