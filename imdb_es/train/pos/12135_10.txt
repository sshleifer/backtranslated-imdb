It is worthwhile to experience each film in which Bette Davis stars. Before Davis co-starred with Leslie Howard in "Of Human Bondage," he had been in more than twenty films. Legend has it that Davis was "robbed" of a 1935 Oscar for her performance as cockney-speaking waitress, single mother, and boyfriend-boyfriend manipulator, Mildred Rogers. The story goes that the AFI consoled Davis by awarding him his 1st Oscar for playing Joyce Heath in "Dangerous". I imagine that the fans of Davis of "Of Human Bondage" who agree with the legend that steals the Oscar will have in my review the contrast of the 1934 film for which the AFI did not reward their performance and the 1936 film " Dangerous "for which he received his 1st Oscar in 1937. <br /> <br /> I have tried to watch all the movies, TV interviews, videos, TV ads from World War II and TV shows by Bette Davis in series popular In retrospect, it's easy to see why this movie, "Of Human Bondage," gave Davis the chance to be nominated for his performance. He was only 25 years old when the film was completed and he was about to reach the Hollywood red carpet. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star due to her performance in "Of Human Bondage". That's what makes her his legendary performance. But, RKO saw his greatness in "The Man Who Played with God" and borrowed it from Warner to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go with the AFI, in retrospect, about 41 years after its successful decision to give Davis his first Oscar for best actress for "Dangerous", 2 years later. By doing so, the AFI may have been instrumental in bringing out the best in one of the most talented actors of the 20th century in Hollywood. Because, from "Of Human Bondage", Davis knew with certainty that she had to reach the depths of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue. Undoubtedly, she deserved more than 2 Oscars; perhaps as much as 6. <br /> <br /> "Dangerous" provides an exemplary contrast in the depth of the characterization of Davis' performance. Because, in "Dangerous" (1936), she becomes the best actress of the 20th century. Davis is as good as Joyce Heath, she is in the middle of the red carpet. While in "Of Human Bondage," Davis is right on the edge, still on the sidewalk and ready to take off the rest of her career as a 60-year-old actress. <br /> <br /> Perhaps for not granting him that legendary Oscar in 1935, instead of a star being born, an incentive was given to an actor to reach beyond his stardom to his soul for the best work of the talented actor. <br /> <br /> It is well known that his contemporary adversary was Joan Crawford; a star whose performances are still not up to Davis's. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a 'star'. Howard Stern is also a radio 'star'. Many people on the stage and the silver screen are stars. Few became great actors. The key difference between them is something that Bette Davis could perceive: the difference between the desire to make a great performance or to be a star. <br /> <br /> I tried to compare these two movies like the ones I have, seeing one right after. the other. Maybe you recognize what AFI and I did. Davis was on the verge of becoming one of the best actors of the 20th century at age 25 and achieved his goal when he was 27 years old. He spent his next 50 years and more setting the bar so high that it has not been reached. . . still. <br /> <br /> If the AFI had sent her the message that she had come to "Of Human Bondage," the story of Davis' life as a great actor may have been taken to a star instead.
