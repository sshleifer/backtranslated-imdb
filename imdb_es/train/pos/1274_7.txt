Keep in mind that all those who did not like and like this movie commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand this kind of criticism. Books and movies are different means of communication. While the books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, the movies take approximately 120 minutes. However, the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, audio and imagination. I do not care if a movie is so good or, in fact, has some resemblance to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge him for what he is. <br /> <br /> This television movie was lovely. An old and frequently seen story, prone to clich√©s, could easily have been shameful. However, Riffen and Reeves take it out. A critic found Riffen very old. I never would have imagined that she was 40 when she made this movie. It's her credit as an actress who played a girl from 23 to 24 years old in an amazingly good way. I also think it's about the best that Reeves has done. The story could have been stronger, and I agree that the screen could have used "adjustment". However, it is worth seeing; clearly it is not a powerful love story, but a charming romance that will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without the obligatory word F # $%, naked buttocks or hours of saliva exchange kisses. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical score is excellent.
