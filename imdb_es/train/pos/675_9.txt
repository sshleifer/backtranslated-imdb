David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, quite good) is a lawyer, more adept at handling corporate taxes (... and suffers from unusual dreams that bother him when he sees this aboriginal man wrapped in darkness), who is called to present a case related to a group. of aborigines accused of the murder of one of their own Billy ... we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual paint and is killed when a leader of an aborigine tribe called Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses a "death" to stop his heart. Meanwhile, spinning around David, the strange weather patterns affect Sydney, like the rain hitting the polluted earth and the hail the size of a rock during the bright blue sky (no clouds of vision, like the one hitting a school in the center of Australia), not to mention a "warped" rainbow that divides (!) into groups. While David pursues the case, he discovers that he is much closer to the strange events that are happening than he could ever realize. An aborigine named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears in a dream holding a bloody stone and discovers that this man is one of those who must represent in the trial! He finds it very possible, after some strange meetings with Charlie and conversations with Chris, that he could be linked to a spirit called Mulkurul and that his dreams are real premonitions of possible horrors yet to come. <br /> <br /> Absorb the apocalyptic drama constructs its story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. With Peter Weir in charge, the film is visually fascinating, as we see these overwhelming images of a possible destiny towards civilization, but the most convincing angle of the film is certainly David's journey to find that monumental truth that torments him while he questions Charlie and Chris incessantly. at the beginning to help his men escape a crime they did not commit, and ultimately, to find out what has to do with anything catastrophic that is happening or may happen later.
