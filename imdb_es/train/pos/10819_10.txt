Of course, this movie was not like. 16 blocks, inside the man, a disturbing American. etc ... <br /> <br /> But it was a great mystery that can happen to any of us ... this movie seemed really fantastic and terrifying. <br /> <br /> I live exactly where they filmed this movie "San Pedro, California" And we've heard real stories based on the incidents of this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you've heard of the famous ship on the long beach "Queen Mary". Well, that ship. this haunted I believe in the skirts, the illusions and, in parallel or however, you spell that. it is real. Everyone is in their own universe. <br /> <br /> and the mind is something very powerful. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie. It's great, and it's not badly run at all. <br /> <br /> for those who qualify it as 1. They do not understand the movie. its meaning. Your plot, your sight. and how bad life can be in the ocean for each and every one of us. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> <br /> Victor
