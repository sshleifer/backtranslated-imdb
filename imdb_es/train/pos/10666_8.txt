When I really started to get interested in the movies, at the age of eleven, I had a great list of movies that "must see" and I would like to go to Blockbuster and rent two or three for the weekend; Some of them were not for everyone and my mother would go crazy. I remember that one of the movies on that list was "A Chorus Line" and I could never get it; so now seeing it is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> Of course, I lost the list and would do anything to get it back because I think there were some really interesting things to see there. I mean, take "A Chorus Line", a play turned into a movie. I know it's something we see a lot today, but back then it was a little different, apparently; and this movie has something special. <br /> <br /> Most of the musicals made today, take advantage of the opportunity that the camera gives them for free, to create different scenarios and take the characters to different places; "A Chorus Line" was born on a theater stage as a play and dies in the same place as a movie. After a great audition by renowned choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough directs a large number of dancers as they try to get the job. <br /> <br /> Everything happens the same day: the tension of not knowing, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the silent competition between the dancers ... And everything happens on stage, where Douglas puts each dancer in the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal lives and their most horrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they get shorter as the hours go by. <br /> <br /> Like a movie I recently saw, "A Prairie Home Companion", the broadcast of a radio show, Atenborough here addresses the problem of continuity. On or behind the scenes, things are happening and time does not seem to stop. Once again, I do not do it if Atenborough cuts a lot to shoot this, but I'm sure he does not; And anyway it's a great job of direction and editing (John Bloom). But in that little scenario, what do you ask yourself is what to do with the camera? With just one scenario, Ronnie Taylor's cinematography finds its way, approaching certain characters, approaching and distancing them, showing the scenario from different perspectives and also gives us a beautiful view of New York. <br /> <br /> At a crucial moment, Douglas says to those left: "Before I start eliminating: all of you are great and I would like to hire them all, but I can not". This made me think of today's reality shows, where the only thing that counts is the talent to sing or dance and where the jury always says the exact words to the participants before some leave (even when they are not good). It is difficult, you must imagine it; At least here, where they are all really great. <br /> <br /> To tell some of the stories, the characters use songs and, in a second, the stage takes on a new life and is literally 'a dream'. Become reality. The music of Marvin Hamlisch and the lyrics of Edward Kleban make the film leak without fail, showing the feelings of these dancers and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett. The book in the theater also becomes an impeccable and very short script by Arnold Schulman; which is very moving at times. Then, if it is not with a song, it will be with a word; but in "A Chorus Line", it is impossible not to be moved. <br /> <br /> During one of the rehearsals at the audition, Cassie, a special dancer played by Alyson Reed, takes the stage to convince the character of Douglas that she can do it. The words "Let me dance for you" they never sounded more honest and more beautiful in music and lyrics.
