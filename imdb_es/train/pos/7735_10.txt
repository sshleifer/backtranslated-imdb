An excellent interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir suspense novel has all the necessary elements: a deranged ex-boxer turned into a bum, an alcoholic widow with sinister desires, a former policeman turned delinquent and a kidnapping plot intended to fatality. However, the film never delves into a clich√© of the country, but remains fresh and intriguing. The performances are excellent, especially the role of Bruce Dern as the evil sleazeball, Uncle Bud. There is a tense uncertainty in the movement of the film that, intentionally or not, adds to the gloomy procedures. Highly recommended
