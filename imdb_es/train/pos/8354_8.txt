Originally I saw this movie years ago during Cinemax Friday after dark series (when the cable box was built like a keyboard), and it intrigued me. Although the film looks useless, it is well interpreted. The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very nice. They have good chemistry together and Miou-Miou makes a pink skin look awesome. A movie like this probably would not. It must be done in these politically correct times (at least not in the United States), as it seems to sensationalize things like violence, theft and casual sex. This film shows that with a talented and talented cast, directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject. I was saddened to discover that Patrick Dewaere committed suicide and in the near future I will verify it with Depardieu and Miou -Miou in Get Out Your Hankerchief.
