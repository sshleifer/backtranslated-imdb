['Like his previous film, &quot;In a glass cage&quot;, Agust√≠ Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more visually refined than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually accomplished and disturbing images that one can see. The dramatic drama, the intensity and the background of the violence threaten the melodramatic or the farce, but never enter it. In that way, he achieves an almost impossible feat: to be so exaggerated and so painfully restricted, to be so charged and so underestimated, and even the final explosives are virtuous parties of the eye. Incredible, beautiful and very tense ... this movie is simply excellent!']
