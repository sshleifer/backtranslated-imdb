To like this movie, at the most, you must be a) strongly in love (without marriage) b) recognize English humor, which consists of admiring the situations of gallant and witty life and not only in commenting gags c) being quite very intelligent, because the authors gave an opportunity to laugh and cry every minute of this movie, and only if you meet the requirements "b" and "c", you can recognize and enjoy the author's comments. d) to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like Kirsted Dunst, who is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) you should admire creative people, a little melancholy with incredible personalities <br /> <br /> if you meet all these requirements, you are likely to rate this movie about 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never laughed half (!) as much as seeing this masterpiece. And I even managed to cry while laughing at some moments (I always get sensitive, every time something good happens to Kirsten Dunst)
