['This is hard to see, as a previous critic says. That&#39;s amazing considering the terrible movies that came out just after the Second World War, particularly the &quot;liberation&quot; of Dachau. It is clear that, from the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence that shows a &quot;transport&quot; is vivid, almost as if based on a real news (the Nazis liked to record their atrocities). Knox as the Nazi is brilliant. He traces the course of a Nazi career. This cartography is particularly revealing when contrasted with the reactions of other Germans, at first laughing at Hitler, then incredulous and, finally, defenseless. That contrast, however, allows us to believe in the &quot;conversion&quot; of a young Nazi officer to an anti-Nazi stance. That happened, as we witnessed the various attempts against Hitler, especially the Staffenberg plot that took place when this movie was released. A strong film, which uses flashbacks, accurately predicts the paths of Nuremberg and others that would occur once the war was over.']
