The SOLDIER is not as bad as many have done. I found that the movie has some cynical and extravagant humor like that of Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and exaggerated action is deliberate and adds to the atmosphere of the comics. <br /> <br /> A bit of curiosity in particular stands out to me: Todd has the names of several space warfare campaigns. D on his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For the forgotten, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in the last elegiac lines of Roy Batty in Blade Runner. Imagine that Todd could have fought alongside the Android troops as Roy is mind-blowing at least. Maybe screenwriter David Peoples was nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I'll give this to 3 out of 5.
