20 out of 10 This is a truly wonderful story about an evacuee from the war and a shy carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is billed with Tom and it is evident that he has serious problems when he wet his bed the first night. William is illiterate and scared, but somehow both find comfort in the loneliness of others. It turns out that William has a talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choirmaster in a fun interpretation of Jerusalem. William became friends with Zacharias Wrench, a young Jewish man also from London and together with Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns to read and write, and to feel part of this small united community. Just when he is establishing himself, William is called back to London by his mother, and it is here that we see why he is so fucked up. His mother is clearly mentally ill and when Tom does not hear from William, he travels to London to look for him. Finally he finds him holding his dead little sister where they have tied him in a basement. After a period in the hospital, Tom realizes that he must kidnap him and take him home with him. The climax is a bittersweet ending when William is told he will be adopted by Tom, while at the same time, upon learning that his best friend, Zacharias, was killed in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom was talking to an official from the Central Office. <br /> <br /> I love 'im, and' for what it's worth, I think he loves me too '. <br /> <br /> Does not it just improve that it does?
