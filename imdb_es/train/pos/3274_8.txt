This is one of the three films of the 80 that I can think of that, unfortunately, were overlooked at that time and, unfortunately, were still overlooked. One of the others was Clownhouse, directed by Victor Salva, a film horribly overlooked by Salva's legal / sexual problems. Another would be Cameron's Closet, which I think is somewhat underestimated, not very good, but not as bad as the comments I've seen. Paper House is well worth your time and I think it is one of those very quiet films that will stay in your brain for much longer than you might think. I mean, 10 years after I saw it and I still stop it a little, while something that I could have seen 6 months ago has gone to ether.
