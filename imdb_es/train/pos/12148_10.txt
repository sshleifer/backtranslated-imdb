This movie has a lot of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this one. It shows his comic side and it was really strange to see him being hit. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought that a knot could be so deadly? A lot of great tricks and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang into the mix and you will have an awesome final showdown! Do not mess with the Manchu thugs; they are ruthless
