In the past, if Marion Davies had his jokes and not only listen to William Randolph Hearst, he would have made more films like Show People and would have been much happier. In fact, when you see her get her first big break in the two-reel comedy, she would have loved to have done that in her career instead of epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> What you are seeing for all the accounts in Show People is the real Davies, a gifted comedian, an excellent mimic and a generous and good-hearted person. She could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper, also known as Patricia Prepoire, who endured her pretense part in her Hollywood stardom. <br /> <br /> If the plot of Show People was developed in the legitimate scenario that you would call It is a story behind the scenes. I guess if it's one of the first movies about movies, it could be called a story behind the camera. Marion is anxious, young and hopeful, who arrives in Hollywood like so many others, in search of that great opportunity. She wants to dramatize, but her introduction to cinema is like the film for burlesque comics. She receives her share of cake and seltzer in the face, but learns her trade. And it also wins the heart of the young comic actor William Haines. <br /> <br /> She has her first big break, but it's not like that for Haines and Marion manages to make a legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli. , playing Andre Telfair, a suitor does not count Count of Avignon. Someone here was shooting the actor Lou Tellegen, lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and, to listen to him, one of the most despised people in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Show People was one of the first films to have star appearances without billing as themselves. You can see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, etc., just being part of the movie colony. That in itself makes Show People a movie worth keeping. <br /> <br /> Show People also made good use of Tin Pan Alley's standard songs like, "We We Got We Got Fun, I'm Sitting On Top Of The World" You'd be surprised, California, here I go. When the film came out on the cusp of the sound that was being introduced, a song called Crossroads was introduced. It is not a bad number, but no credit is given to the boy and girl who sing it on the soundtrack. I guess since they do not look, he felt that it was not necessary to check in. Still, I'd like to know and I'm sure he would if he's lucky enough to see Show People. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see why Marion Davies liked this movie so much and considered it personal. Favourite. He looks so comfortable in this film and his lack of pretension in real life is reflected in his performance, which makes it a real pleasure for the audience.
