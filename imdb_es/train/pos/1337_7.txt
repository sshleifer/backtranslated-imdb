......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chori. Do not get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or even) than Pretty Woman, but (it was) a new theme for Bollywood. The subject was accepted but it is far from Jism, Murder and Julie. In fact, the subject is presented in a very clean way. But the plot has its number of clich√©s. The beginning of the film is presented in a very "cinematic" way. There are some very small plot holes. The movie begins once Rani has his miscarriage in which you feel you are seeing something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the whole family sequence felt exaggerated at first. The performance could not have been better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses and sometimes disappoints you. Around here he gave one of the best performances. On top of that, your paper is written so well, that you applaud every time you solve a problem. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. Throughout the film, you feel more for your character, but Preity Zinta outshines her. Preity Zinta is a perfect image. Of the three, she gives everyone a race for her money. It's amazing how he can be so convincing when he's innocent. And believe me, Madhubala is far from your girl next door. This role is one of the reasons why I qualify it as high. The cast of support is like the family you see in HAHK, where they do not matter to the plot, but here I found them tolerable. The songs are pretty beautiful. The title song is my favorite of all of them along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Watch the view of the world) are two songs that fit perfectly into the film. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Loco), could have been shortened while Punjabi number 1 was bored although he had a good dance. Otherwise the movie is definitely worth seeing.
