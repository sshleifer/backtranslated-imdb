In Carmen, Saura seeks once again to establish a dynamic relationship between reality and fiction, between the real passions of the personalities in a dance company that prepares the choreography for the dance parts of the opera Carmen and the scripted passions of the fictional Carmen story. , the famous fatal mixture of a free spirit (read without taking fidelity into account) and its capacity to drive men crazy with desire. Saura used this same vehicle of fiction / reality in a previous film in black and white, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But while the tensions between dancers rehearsing Blood Wedding showed an advantage over how the fictional characters of the story evolved by directing their emotions to their roles, in Carmen, the parallel between the small libidinal impulses of the La tropa dancers during the rehearsals and the spirit that forges the myth of Carmen never becomes credible. It remains a contraption and, for that reason, an annoying distraction. One really needs to see Blood Wedding together with Carmen to appreciate the comparison. However, it almost does not matter, the melodrama that Saura tries to impose on his Carmen, because the flamenco dance and the guitar music of the rehearsals, which are 95% of the film - by some of the best-known flamenco dancers and musicians, They more than pay the entrance price. A flawed film and a wonder: perfect to do an exercise in the "negative capacity" of Keats, perhaps?
