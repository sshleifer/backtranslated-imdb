This is the best image of baseball since Redford hit The Natural in our own way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths illuminate the screen with a great story and a cast that seems real enough to take you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Moored by dreams: dripping in reality, the American dream rekindles after 9/11 with a true story about Devil Ray's middle-aged rookie Jimmy Morris. Australian actress Rachel Griffiths plays a West Texas native, better than many Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection? Choose the winner of aspiring, gonnabe and humble with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. It is real. Screen chemistry works. If you like baseball heaters, you will love this movie. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all there. My popcorn became the 'a la mode'. <br /> <br /> And hey: buy the CD! Music rocks and carries the story beautifully! Synchronizing words and music makes the story advance exactly as it should, an area that disappoints me more often than not. <br /> <br /> Criticism: I would have given baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us about character and heart. Santa Rita and the nuns were a nice decoration, but they never found their place in history to open and close around them. A little long It's worth every minute in the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
