I would have given this otherwise excellent series a total of 10 votes if Claudia Black had not continued on it! His inclusion as the fool 'Vela' has made the series fall in my opinion. Bringing it on a regular basis at the same time as including Ben Browder to replace RDA was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we were recovering from the loss of 'Jack' and really did not need this great The series became new episodes of 'Farscape'. <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of the movie "Stargate" and when the series was announced for the first time I had doubts that I could live up to the movie, but after watching the first episode I have to admit that I was hooked. I have always expected new episodes with great anticipation.
