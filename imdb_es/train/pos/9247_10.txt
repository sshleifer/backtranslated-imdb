I hoped that this movie was a romantic novel of the thirties. The boy meets the girl, they fall in love, the boy loses the girl, the boy recovers at the end. It was not like that at all. Clark Gable plays the swindler Eddie with all his usual charisma and his roguish eyebrow. He hides from the police when he bursts into Ruby's apartment (Jean Harlow) to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. Instant chemistry She plays hard for a while, but a girl can only resist that smile for so long. The heat between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job goes wrong and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for "girls with problems", she feels miserable and, thanks to the rag that her roommate gives her, she begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays Ruby, who talks hard and speaks perfectly. Never let Gable get all the good lines! There is an especially moving scene with her playing "her song" on the piano that acts perfectly. The last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. A really sweet romance.
