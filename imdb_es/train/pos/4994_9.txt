Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a Pre-Code movie. These are realistic events with really nice and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a penny in his pocket. He earns his living doing occasional jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings. One night, he meets Trina, a beauty from any point of view that is cold and alone. She has refused to resort to prostitution, so she has not eaten for several days, but both relate very well to each other and form a relationship. His free spirit tempts him to leave, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between the two, even if they live in a hut by the river. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the great actors. of the silver screen. His characters are incredible and relatable. We can see his thoughts on his face, which makes it easy to identify with him, even if we think he is misbehaving. Young is great at pre-code movies. Her character is very sweet, but far from perfect, which makes her more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Pre-codigo elements include thin immersion, pregnancy before marriage and crime.
