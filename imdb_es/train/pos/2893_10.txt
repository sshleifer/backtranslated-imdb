['CINDERELLA from Walt Disney takes a story that everyone is familiar with and embellishes it with humor and suspense, while retaining the essential charm of the story. Disney artists provide the film with an engaging storybook that exudes a delightful fairytale atmosphere. It is beautifully, although conventionally, animated; The highlight is the captivating scene in which the Fairy Godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic trainer and Cinderella&#39;s rags into a gorgeous dress. Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston offer beautiful songs like &quot;A dream is a wish for your heart&quot; and &quot;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo&quot; that improve both the stage and the characters. <br /><br /> Although the story of CINDERELLA is predictable, it offers a melodrama so exciting that it shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends. Both the evil stepmother and her terrible cat Lucifer present a formidable threat that threatens the dreams and aspirations of Cinderella and the mice. It is this threat that provides history with a strong conflict that maintains the interest of the spectators. The suspense of the film, however, is well balanced by a sweet serenity, especially in musical numbers. It is in these segments that reveal the attractive personalities of Cinderella and her friends, moving viewers to take care of them. In general, CINDERELLA by Walt Disney is a wonderful family entertainment that has remained remarkably well after half a century.']
