THE SECRET OF KELLS may be the most exquisite movie I've seen since THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Although it is very different from the stylistic point of view, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (the amazing 2D sequence of KUNG FU), an incredible direction of art, production design, background / design and a richness of colors that is a feast for the senses. KELLS is so luxurious, almost Gothic in its design (reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat in its overall general perspective, adorned in its Celtic and illuminated design, but the characters are so simplistic and attractive, and everything works very well. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You attract every detail of the story and every stroke of the pencil and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone in Cartoon Saloon (and their extended teams) have accomplished with this small budget / VERY small movie with crew, is absolutely amazing. The support base among our animation community is phenomenal. This film is impressive and the rumor among our colleagues when recommending this film is spreading like wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS for her numerous awards, her nomination to Annie and her current Oscar grading career. All are well-deserved assents, in fact ...
