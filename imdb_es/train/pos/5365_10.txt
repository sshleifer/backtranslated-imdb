The Running Man is often dismissed as a simple action thriller Arnie filled with explosions, bad puns and shots, and to be fair, there's a lot of that in it. People used to watch it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of Schwarzenegger's poorest films. <br /> <br /> But, give it 18 years, and you find yourself able to appreciate it in a different light. Instead of being another brainless action movie, it works very well as a parody of the reality TV show. It's quite different from Stephen King's book, it's true, but I doubt that Hollywood, with its love for optimistic endings and the so-called 'common guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its original version. current form. <br /> <br /> But, with the revision. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a policeman working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is governed by an amalgam of government / media conglomerates . The economy is in shreds, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted when performing sadistic games for them to see, like Jump for dollars, where people jump for money on a well of rabid dogs, and the most popular is The Running Man, a game program organized by the squalid Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where the alleged 'criminals' are persecuted by escatastic 'stalkers' and professional wrestlers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some, however, try and speak against the government. When a group of hungry people makes a protest in the city of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to "calm" (ie, kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to shoot innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is condemned to a slave labor camp, but escapes with the help of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and runs away. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom does not last long, and after the employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) kidnaps the network in an attempt to escape from those who persecute him, he is again imprisoned, but this time he's forced to appear in The Running Man. <br /> <br /> And there, of course, the whole movie goes into Arnie's standard mode. Richards launches into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) And is forced to flee from the "stalkers", along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labor camp with him . Amber is also curious about Richards' innocent protests and discovers that he was framed. Guess what's wrong with her, then? So, when Amber, Richards and the other two boys try to avoid the stalkers, we soon realize that Richards is not a common cop. He is Super Arnie, the unimaginable one-man army that can tear down evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights, while he's just an average American man with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the movie becomes silly, noisy, classic from the 80's of Arnie. There are many exciting fight sequences, the gruesome word games of the trademark ('He had to split' being my favorite), and the final general formula and the happy ending. It is also very funny to see Killian react to him in the typical "healthy" game host form, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (careful to the damn old woman!) and the cold, kinetic man who is really the one who will do anything to increase the grades. <br /> <br /> If you expect a smart and intelligent movie, you will be disappointed. But if you want a great movie from the 80s, well, that's it. But the good thing about this movie is that it was quite prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you look at the entertainment that we have today, you will have noticed the way in which reality is developing nowadays: programs with people willing to participate. through anything for five minutes of fame, and the producers are very willing to let them humiliate themselves on television. It's not such a big leap to imagine that some vile TV executive has been trying to get the right to show people who are executed live on television. However, we have already had that with the macabre videos of Al Qaeda hostage beheading published on the Internet. It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine watching the real death on their televisions. <br /> <br /> Keeping this in mind, and along with the fact that everything these days seems to be a Renaissance of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the vision of the future of this film. Of course, we still have not reached that point, since it is the terrorists, instead of the traditional media, who have bought us readily available programs with real human death, but you just have to wonder how much time will pass before some Executive decides to see if He can find a way to launch a program that combines people's desire for entertainment and the desire to satisfy their morbid curiosity ...
