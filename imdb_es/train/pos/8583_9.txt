The Korean War has been dubbed America's forgotten war. So many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50,000 men who died there. From time to time, they invite us to a play or movie that deals with that distant frozen and ghostly cemetery. Here is perhaps one of the best. It's called "Sergeant Ryker." The story is about an American soldier named Sergeant. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin), who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer. Their task is to desert the North Koreans and offer their services against the United Nations forces. Its cover is so successful, that it is invaluable to the enemy and has the rank of Major. However, he is subsequently captured by the Americans, brought to trial as a traitor and spy. By claiming that he was ordered to desert, he sadly learns that his commanding officer has been killed and has no proof or proof of his innocence. He is condemned and sentenced to hang. However, his conviction is doubtful by Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Convinced of commanding General Amos Baily, (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he is granted a new trial and, if found guilty, will be executed. The drama of the court is first class as is the cast that includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was a distant place, but the possibility of condemning a communist and hanging him was very important in the fifties. Due to its excellent script and its powerful message, this drama has become a classic of the court. Excellent viewing and recommended to all. ****
