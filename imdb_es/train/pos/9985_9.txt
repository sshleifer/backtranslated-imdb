I recently saw this film in Winnipeg, appropriate, given the location used. The first time I read Lawrence's book was in the 70s and for me, it has always been a very powerful image of the tests of aging in our society. It resonated when I was young, and now it resonates even more. When the movie came out, I wanted to see if history could survive. and I was very impressed, especially with the performance of Ellen Burstyn. He manages to give us a complete human being, although the character is generally irritable and critical, someone you would not want to live with. It's great to see the favorite characters come to life in such an authentic way.
