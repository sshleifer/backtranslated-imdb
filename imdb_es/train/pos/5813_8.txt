This movie is great. <br /> <br /> Now, I like that my films are based on history and dialogue, but occasionally something like Moonwalker appears, and you can see it, despite the numerous flaws. <Br /> <br /> This movie is just a very entertaining announcement by Michael Jackson. Starting with the sickening video in 'Man in the Mirror', a montage that lists his achievements and fragments of his career, he goes through all the highlights of his life, then crashes into a truly entertaining segment that acts like a fun music video of 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon', following the adventures of MJ as he runs from fans of stop-motion fans, and finally dancing with a rabbit costume. The stop motion is not as bad as some would make you believe. It is passable. <br /> <br /> Then we see the great video of 'Leave me alone', and directly to the main function. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very laughable We see Michael leaving a building and then being shot by thousands of soldiers. Then we came to the flashback, showing MJ and three children stumbling into an underground lair. 'Mr Big' (Joe Pesci) is the infamous villain who has a plan for all children around the world to engage in 'drugs' (no details are mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the little girl she is with are trapped, then chased ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really the important part. We get two very interesting sequences in which MJ becomes a car, then a robot ship, and of course, the incredible sequence 'Smooth Criminal'. <br /> <br /> It's a regular movie, but it's great for someone who likes MJ. It has most of its greatest hits, and some great little snippets, and some pretty good special effects (in particular, the Robot / Spaceship sequence). It's worth it, especially seen as if you could get it back for about a quid on eBay. It will keep children quiet for a couple of hours, as well as most of the 20 that were children when it was first released.
