I do not see how this show is like the OC at all. <br /> <br /> First of all, the center of attention is centered around teenagers and their parents trying to spend their lives. North Shore is about the staff of a hotel that tries to manage the hotel and have a social life at the same time. Second, The OC takes place in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why would Fox make a program like one of his other programs on the same network? I think this is a great show with good actors for the most part. It has a good plot and argument. I like the events that happen and how people take care of them and solve them. The most recent episode was surprising how the story worked. It was not predictable like most stories in most programs. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps it in the air.
