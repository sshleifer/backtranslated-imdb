This tender, beautifully elaborated production deeply delved into my bittersweet self. The irreverent students, the embittered bus driver of life and the personalities of the teachers present a subliminal debate as the story unfolds. All adult characters seem familiar, my teachers, the driver of my bus, each of their opinions is so plausible and known. When a key incident occurs on the bus, they send us to a circuit of points of view. All the time, the organizers of the trip only keep the babbling of adolescent energy under control. Mr. Harvey is experiencing a lot of pain throughout. It reminds me of the teachers damaged by the war that I did not understand when I was an irreverent student. <br /> <br /> Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much praise for this well-formed British film. Acting smoothly, the appropriate scenes, should be widely available but does not seem to have had the right opportunity.
