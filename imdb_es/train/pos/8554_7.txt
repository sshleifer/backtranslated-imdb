Wow, this was another good twist on the original American pie, not as good as in the band's camp, but definitely much better in the nude mile. Dwight and Erik Stifler led the comedy in this, but actually I preferred dialogue in this to the naked mile. The script was written much better and the comedy flowed more smoothly, however, most of the comedy came from sex, but that's fine because that's why we see these movies, right? <br /> <br /> The Rock dwarf also had a good cameo, considering the intense effort made by him in the nude mile, his scene with suffocating was amazing and made me laugh my ass when I saw him. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the movie was a definite improvement compared to the nude mile. If you liked the previous American Pie movies, you would like the beta version, unless you see all the side effects of the American pie as a waste of money.
