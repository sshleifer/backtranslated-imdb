I am a big fan of the television series Dukes of Hazzard. And I really enjoyed this movie. I had a lot more fun here than with other summer blockbusters. <br /> <br /> It's funny to hear people criticize this movie with excuses like "boring plot" and "it's much more crude than the show". Does anyone remember the rawness of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke had probably fathered half the children in the orphanage. The only reason why it was cleaned is because it changed to a previous time slot. <br /> <br /> And as far as the plot goes. It was the perfect plot of the dukes. In fact, as a remake, it will probably stay more faithful to the source material than any television show that has migrated to the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville do not like their small screen versions EXACTLY, they do a great job and work very well together. Although I was not too interested in Burt's Boss Hogg. And I would have liked a little more the incompetence of Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie, Roscoe is a bit ... scared. <br /> <br /> And who did not have a smile on their face when General Lee is running through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard? <br /> <br /> Friends, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you will not regret it. It's just a great silly movie!
