That My Bush is a live action project made by the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The program was canceled after a season, not because of bad reviews (actually received good reviews), but because it was very expensive. It's a pretty funny parody of a network television comedy. It is also a political satire. Now, this is not as good as South Park, but it's a very funny parody of a comedy and also a pretty good political satire. The guy who plays in that bush looks a lot like him! If you can find the program, take a look. There are many laughs! <br /> <br /> 9/10
