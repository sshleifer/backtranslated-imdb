First of all, I must say that I made the mistake of seeing the Elections movies out of sequence. I say unfortunately, because after seeing Election 2 first, the choice seems a bit disappointing. Both films are gangster epics that are similar in form. And while The Choice is a nice piece of cinema ... it's just not as good as its sequel. <br /> <br /> In the first installment of the Election, we are shown the two competitors for President; Big D and Lok. After some discussion scenes among the "Uncles" about who should have the title of President, they (almost unanimously) decide that Lok (Simon Yam) will be the leader of the Triads. Suffice to say that this does not go very well with the competitor Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and in an attempt to influence the acquisition, Big D kidnaps two of the uncles to influence the electoral board at his side. This has disastrous results and directs the triads towards total war. Lok is determined to become President, but will not become an officer until he can retrieve the "Dragon Head Staff", a material representation of the power of the President. The current president, Whistle (Chung Wang) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland China and the race is to see who can recover it first. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is dedicated to the recovery of the baton. . While the two aspiring leaders seek him out, they must dodge the cops and opposite sides, which leads to one of the scenes featured in Election, which involves a subordinate named Jet (Nick Cheung), a machete and many bad guys. The presence of Nick Cheung draws attention to say the least ... I wonder if this influenced in any way the director Johhnie To to make the second choice, as it delivers more of the character of Jet in the sequel. <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung gives a scene stealing performance, I should not stop giving due to the rest of the actors in the movie. The choice has a great cast with thoughtful performances that are both subtle and striking. Simon Yam is his generally glorious self and the film also benefits from the heavyweight actors of Hong Kong such as Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and the underestimated Suet Lam. There really are no weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they are seeing real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are excellent, one of the most impressive things about the Choice is Johnnie To's eye for the camera. There are some really amazing shots in the film and it goes without saying that To definitely knows how frame your shots, as the viewer receives a series of innovative and quite bright camera angles and placements. All of which makes the Election, above all, a great looking film. <br /> <br /> My problems with the film arise mainly from the number of characters involved in the Election. It's a bit difficult to follow because the movie is full of characters that are not an integral part of the plot. While the sequel chooses to focus more on the two candidates, the first Election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles, subordinates and police officers who crowd the story. Perhaps the film would have worked better if it had been a little more time with more time devoted to the inner workings of the Triad, or if Director Johnnie To had channeled the necessary elements and exposed them more. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: in general, this is a wonderfully brutal movie with a great cast, excellent direction and a leisurely pace that has a great impact. It's just a little more complicated than it needed to be.
