This spectacular movie is one of the most incredible movies I've seen in my life. It shows a China that I had never seen or imagined, and I think it shows the 1930 China with the most REAL light that has been seen in a movie. It is absolutely heartbreaking in so many situations, seeing how difficult life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful. You will truly see the depths and values ​​of human existence in this film. All the actors are perfect, so you feel that you really entered a different world. <br /> <br /> I just can not recommend this movie enough. It may change you forever once you've seen it.
