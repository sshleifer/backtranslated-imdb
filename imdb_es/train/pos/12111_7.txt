The first time I started watching this anime I never thought that something about making bread could be interesting, but fortunately I was wrong. From the moment I started watching it, the anime just entered the world of baking, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is its humor, which is very smart and very funny, with some recurring gags. But the animation, the soundtrack and the development of the character are below average, while these disadvantages are not seen so much in the first episodes, due to the great work in this anime, it really begins to show in the last 20 episodes, when Reactions and recurrent gags just get old, and they are not as fun as before. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, if this anime had ended with episode 52, I would have given it a 9, but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste, which unfortunately can not be dragged by the amazing 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
