The night is an entertaining movie with a lot of depth. All actors and actresses become spectacular performances. However, with the tremendous cast, a stellar performance is expected, but in this film expectations are exceeded. One can relate to personalities and situations in one's family. By observing the interaction of family members, memories of the family are immediately remembered. This is one of the few films that inspires us to read the book. Usually, it's the other way around; One reads the book and then wants to see the movie. I will definitely get a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. The landscape of Rhode Island is spectacular as is the soundtrack. Any car enthusiast will enjoy vintage cars, apparently restored by experts. Needless to say now, but I highly recommend the night. See it you will enjoy it.
