This movie was more a passage to the manhood of a gay man, and how he should deal with everyone. Her mother is depressed, her younger sister is a pain, her older sister is accepting a little. The relationship looks good with her boyfriend / exhooker and leaves her family to try life with this first boy. Unfortunately, the new guy messed with him and said it really did not mean anything. Our young gay man goes crazy and ends up in Looney's compartment and eventually leaves, leaves his new lover and starts over. We stay with him beginning again and seeing, not participating, in happiness. So maybe things will be better for him in the future. The ending was a bit disappointing, but the whole movie was completely realistic, so I'll let this real ending slip bye with a high score.
