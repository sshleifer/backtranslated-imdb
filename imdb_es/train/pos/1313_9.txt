More television movies should be made like this. I saw it in '93 when it was the first time on television. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were great, and they offered very realistic performances. Weber was especially good, turning into an exceptionally spooky and discreet performance as the child molester / killer. This movie really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed "Hoosiers", which in some way was both formulated and exciting. But the direction in both of these works has the same austere and simple realism that is so attractive. If you like television movies that are not predictable and are full of overacting, see if you can. The parallel story about Hunt and the Fahey affair is also attractive without detracting from the main story.
