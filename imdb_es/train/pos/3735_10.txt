The really moving story of a recruiting camp in America, where young people are prepared for the Vietnam War. Human study always attracted me when it comes to war movies, because it translates personal and subjective opinions about war, opposite war action movies in which action is analyzed and technical data to the detriment of the human factor. <br /> <br /> The film manages to give a new twist to an old theme, and manages to distance itself from the usual war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the point of view of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who cleverly avoids being absorbed by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to relinquish control over his fate and fight for something he does not believe in, uses his energy to find ways to avoid it. When being sent abroad, both for him and for his companions, and ironically ends up finding his own just reason to finally go to war. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> The acting is truly exceptional, and the filming of documentary style almost makes you feel transposed to the movie. In addition, the film will serve as a source of reflection for those enthusiastic about the action in the usual war movies or the war games enthusiasts, and hopefully awaken some minds of a generation that fortunately escaped the terror of being recruited.
