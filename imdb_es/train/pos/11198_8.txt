Hitchcock shows his already developed understanding for images in this early silent film. The plot of the film, which involves two boxers fighting for a girl, is a direct drama without much to recommend. Hitchcock's talent, however, lies in his impressive use of images. Almost every shot is full of visual symbols. Especially memorable are the jewels that a boxer gives to the girl just before he marries the other boxer. He slides it down his arm in a clearly sexual way and with a simple movement, Hitch has shown us everything we need to know. The boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point-of-view shots that demonstrate once again how far ahead Hitchcock was. The movie also gives an idea of ​​their subsequent treatment of women. The object of boxers' desires is money and lust, not reason or love. The only other women in the movie are the beautiful party girls who make open sex offers or the old witches who help destroy happy relationships. All in all, the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller.
