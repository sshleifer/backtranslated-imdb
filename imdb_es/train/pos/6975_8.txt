If I had just seen the pilot of this program, I would have qualified him with a 10. I was immediately hooked on this wonderful new world. Subsequent episodes have not completely fulfilled the promise, but I will continue to observe and hope that it continues to improve. The production values ​​are incredible and the performance is of the first order. I do not care that it does not seem to perfectly align with BSG because I'm so intrigued by the premise and let's be honest, it's two different shows. I am delighted that both Esai Morales and one of my all time favorites, Eric Stoltz, have returned to my life (even if only weekly) as I have missed them both. This is a show that requires a little thought from your audience and that is always a good thing. You have to wrap your head in certain aspects of the show; Things are not always what they seem and there are certainly shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in plot lines, characters and, of course, in the various virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the trip seems to be quite a trip.
