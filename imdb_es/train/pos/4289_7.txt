I have to be 100% honest with you, other IMDb users. I wanted to see this movie for a long time just for the poster. Does not Charlotte Gainsbourg look extremely sexy and charming smiling like that? I'm in love with that woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film should generate expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories that involve intelligent humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> Although I do not agree with another IMDb user who claims that the movie is overvalued; I must admit that "Pr√©te-moi ta main" has many flaws. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the movie is the lack of chemistry on the screen between the main characters. There is not a single scene before the climax that shows the main characters sharing a "romance" moment or even a clue to suggest that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, the one scene in which we both share a moment is tremendously uncomfortable (when both are on the couch) and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest. I did not buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> Even so, the film offers very funny moments and has a strong dialogue that supports such a naive premise. I want to say with naive that in these days it would be very difficult to execute such a fake fight by a man of 43 years. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a movie and that's why I accept it as a fun situation. In addition, humor is versatile. There are moments that involve S & M, funny lines with Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, fun situations involving women in the family and more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she is the reason to watch the movie. She is funny, sexy, looks very thin and thin, and shows that she is a versatile and talented actress who can take a comedic and dramatic performance with total clarity. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is an excellent actor and gives a decent decent performance I think the support cast does what it can. <br /> <br /> The score, the artistic direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic aspect to the film. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this type of cinema should be satisfied after the final credits. It is a good example of feeling good about cinema.
