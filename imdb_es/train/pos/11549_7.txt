There's nothing I do not like about "The Odd Couple," and it's no wonder that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau form a hugely winning comic team. But there is something so little developed about Neil Simon's adaptation of his successful play to make it look more like a play in a sketch comedy than a full-length movie. I have not seen the work, but I must assume that the screen version is quite faithful, since Simon wrote it, so the flaws can not be attributed to an adaptation from stage to screen. There are some interesting ideas in this story: two recently divorced men who immediately fall into the traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither of them knows anything different, that Simon never completely abandons. However, there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours.
