This film took Jerry Springer's approach to superhuman power. "Wilder Napalm" is the kind of film based on the theme that I love, and it addresses the idea that prodigies in the United States are defined by their gifts or by attempts to hide them. At the same time, the film points out that each prodigy is only human, and no more to be feared or adored than any other human being. This was a great comedy, fun and human with that slight satirical touch.
