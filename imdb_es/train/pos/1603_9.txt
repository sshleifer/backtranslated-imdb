['I&#39;m really surprised that this movie did not score higher in IMDB. It is one of those movies that someone could easily get, but for the romantic comedy &quot;Moonstruck&quot; is really in a class by itself. The environment and ethnic charm are things that people seem to take for granted. The casting only makes it an almost perfect movie. Few films in the 1980s were as good as &quot;Moonstruck&quot; and it&#39;s also funny. **** outside *****']
