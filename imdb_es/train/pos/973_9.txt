['Woohoo! Very funny! Probably a bit too much for normal American kids, and it really is an exaggeration to call this a children&#39;s movie, this movie reminded me a bit of Time Bandits, very much like Terry Gilliam. While the general narrative is quite simple, Miike still throws MANY surreal moments and Bunuel-esquire. The first violent act juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the child / main hero, with the world of the spirits and the evil that occurs in it. And while the ending has a somewhat ambiguous aspect that is common in Miike&#39;s work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / revenge message of human madness, is very damningly moving. As manic and imaginatively funny as other great films of Miike, only that instead of exaggerating the torture and the blood, it gives us an infinite amount of monsters and yokai of the Japanese folklore conceived creatively through CG and puppets involved in a multifaceted imaginative adventure . F&#39;n rad, and one of the best of Miike!']
