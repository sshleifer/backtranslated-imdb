I caught this movie late one night / Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking This is one of the best movies to destroy that I've seen. From the 'luxury' liner, it is actually a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron all on the doors with adhesive stickers that say personal, and then you see the same door that is used for another thing in another scene: this movie is amazing !! The continuity is so poor that you can not help but notice it, it hits you in the face with the holes. In the final scene, jump out of a lifeboat with the ferry in the distance. Cut off his son and his new girlfriend (the public relations director of the boats that knows kung fu and used to be in the police, but was fired for doing things his way, it's true) on the ferry that drove away Very fast from the explosion. ...... Then the dad is there hugging them. How???? Who cares, its magic. There is no feature that redeems this movie. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with a casino table. When the villains chase them, there's only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, fire four fruit machines and a small corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They pass directly through the only hiding place, which allows our Casper to get around them and 'take them out'. <br /> <br /> Involve some classmates, drink some drinks, put on this movie and howl.
