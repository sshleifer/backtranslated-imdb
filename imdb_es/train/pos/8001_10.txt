Without doubt one of the best movies I've seen for quite some time. An exquisite direction and an impeccable performance make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington plays one of his most attractive and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast performs perfectly. Christopher Walken is, of course, excellent on his part, although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A history of maximum greed that is counterproductive is offset by the innocence and love of a child. This is also a movie for lovers of action movies, as it has a good amount of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a sense of sordid and corruption that in itself is a revelation. In short, a really exciting movie from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
