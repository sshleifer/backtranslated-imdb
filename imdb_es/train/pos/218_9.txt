Taking on the roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns performed a couple of old vaudeville comics, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale that seem to have a different perspective on life. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop working, the man never learned to relax, take time and smell the roses. He is an old and mean friend whose best days are behind him, and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin find less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What hurt him the most was that, about 15 years earlier, his partner George Burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A workaholic like Matthau can not understand him and make Burns' decision personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits in a storm of ideas, gathers the boys and does it in a national television special. What happens here is pretty hilarious. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys are also a sad and bittersweet story, in addition to old age. Matthau is on screen for most of the movie, but it was Burns who received praise in the form of an Oscar at the age of 79. <br /> <br /> Burns added some staff to this movie as well. As we all know, he was the heterosexual man of the wonderful Burns & Allen comedy team, from whom the Monty Python troop borrowed a lot. In 1958, due to health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George continued until he was 100 years old. Or at least as an active actor. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys is based on the team of However, Smith and Dale, and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I recommend you watch Two Tickets to Broadway to see a couple of guys who entertained American public at the end of the last century. The doctor's sketch that Matthau and Burns make is directly from their material. <br /> <br /> And I think you'll like the Sunshine Boys.
