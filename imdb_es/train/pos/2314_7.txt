I had heard good things about this movie and, as you guessed it, I was a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is promised surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, from a young age; Actually the whole cast (small) is quite solid, in its simple American configuration of the 50s. The reason why I did not rate this movie higher is mainly that towards the end, the pain shown by the older sister did not seem so real and this got me out of the movie a bit. Maybe we're expected to complete the plot, or maybe the movie needed to be a little longer. Maureen's character is quite undeveloped, I think. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., the youngest) is traumatized and angry, but why is it shown that her sister is more upset? Because she is a few years older? Did not the end have undermined the rest of the movie? The pace of the film makes it look like Maureen and Court have just met each other, when they get through it (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect, it looks like it might have been trying to surprise you a little. It depends on what you want: if you want the happy story of young women about the young love that you seem to get, you will be surprised. Is the man on the moon both picturesque and dreamy and a hard movie coming of age? A rather uncomfortable combination? However, I liked the character of Court, I can see what the girls who see this look at. And I loved the fact that they had the courage to let him hurt the younger sister (most men would, most movies would not) and that they would kill him. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on my grades scale quite hard. For some reason I found Jason London in a funny tractor.
