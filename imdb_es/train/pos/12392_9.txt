"The second beginning," as its title explains, shows us the beginning of the end for the human race. Established long before the matrix existed, this brief anime written by Wachowski shows us the world that could be in front of us in the not too distant future, established at the beginning of the 21st century, the second rebirth goes into common problems with behavior human ; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intelligences as slaves or servants is common among science fiction and fantasy stories. The second rebirth is no exception to this concept; however, instead of a simple design of man versus machine, this story explains the struggle that machines endure, the struggle for acceptance in a world governed by humans. Where matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second part of rebirth 1 + 2, answers many questions raised by the original Matrix movie, such as war broke out, how the sky darkened, which led to the use of humans as batteries and also introduces us to the city of the machine called 01, which may have relevance for the next Matrix Revolutions movie. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal too much of the story, since I do not want to ruin the experience for the prospective viewers, however, I will recommend it to anyone interested in the world of the matrix or simply to anyone interested in it. the Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
