A collapse in a nuclear power plant causes most people to become lethal zombies, with a face of putrefaction and confusion that naturally throw themselves into a frightful uproar. A handful of uninfected people do everything possible to survive this ordeal. The director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets shows a love and a passion that is attractively sincere because of the vivacious and frightening horror of going straight to the throat: it maintains an agile and unbreakable rhythm at all times, fills the screen from wall to wall as crazy Action, and fortunately keeps the terrible dialogue to the pleasant minimum. In addition, Sheets certainly does not skimp on the gloriously graphic and the excess of exaggerated splashes: this image offers a tasty truck loaded with melted flesh, evisceration, a lot of chewing guts, a guy has his heart beat, and there's even a nice impalement on a tree branch. Sheets earns bonus points for keeping the somber and unpleasant tone literally bitter until the end (for example, almost all the main characters end up becoming chow zombies). Granted, this film has its fair share of flaws: irregular editing, several attempts to cheat, and the largely frightening performance of a cast of unnamed rank leaves much to be desired. The most important honors go to the beautiful and cheerful Kasey Rausch for her winning interpretation of the ingenious Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay also performs well as the robust army veteran, Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheets ensures a contagious feeling of relentless momentum and an obvious affinity for the horror genre ensures that this remains a total explosion to see from start to finish.
