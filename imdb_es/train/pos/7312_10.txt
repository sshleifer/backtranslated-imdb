It took me a while to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a child, I remember that I really enjoyed the aftermath, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one was slow and took too long to get to the point. I saw him a couple of times recently and now I know he was wrong. Today I really understand this movie, the meaning it has, all the feeling of this masterpiece of terror. It is not about blood and blood. It's not about naked girls and bad jokes. It's the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. It's about the night his insane brother returns home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie is destined to be scary and I think it is very successful. It is also one of the first films of Slasher, a subgenre of terror that I have always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, spooky music and talented young actors, like Jamie Lee Curtis in his first role. Do I need to say more? Anyone who has never seen him, a fan of horror or not, should do his cinematographic task at this moment. Highly recommended!
