The Coda Dello Scorpione (a.k.a Case of the Scorpion's Tail) was the follow-up of the director Sergio Martino to the wonderful giallo Strano vizio della Signora Wardh. This is the giallo par excellence, with all the aspects that fans of the genre have come to know and love. The twisted plot, the beautiful girls, the black gloves, the sharp blades and a little blood come together to make a large part of the Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> A group of gialli favorites, both in front and behind the camera, works to make this one of the best gialli that is not Argento. It includes Martino, who already mentioned it, as director, the great giallo Ernesto Gastaldi as a writer, Bruno Nicolai to the creation of music and a large number of stars and stars of giallo, such as George Hilton, actor Luigi Pistilli and the attractive Anita Strindberg. br /> <br /> With all this talent behind, Scorpione meets? You bet The movie works on many different levels. It's an exciting murder mystery, a tense and violent horror movie, and a suspense suspense. In short, one of the best gialli in the world. <br /> <br /> Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli. At some points in the film, he almost seems to be channeling Argento into his focus. For example, there is a direct theft of the scene in Bird With the Crystal Plumage where the killer tries to break the door, which really surpasses Argento's movie. <br /> <br /> Is there a problem with the movie? ? Hmmm ... only the minors. First, any scene that is not following the murders or the incipient romance between the two protagonists begins to get bored. But just before you fall asleep, the killer will come out of nowhere and you'll be back on the swing of things. <br /> <br /> Also, towards the end, the turns become a little too strange. I mean, what did the scorpion pins really do for? If you do not pay much attention to the dialogue, you could easily lose yourself with the plot and the plot of the plot. <br /> <br /> But aside from these minor issues, La Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense subject, full of suspense, with class and all the cinema entertained for fans of giallo. Look for it!
