This work is less about the character of Steve Martin, Davis, than about Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon), and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue inserted through Davis is reflecting, almost poetic existentialism at its maximum expression. . He is ingenious, intelligent and thoughtful in both the delivery and the content of the dialogue. The writers deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The performances are easy, relaxed and natural; just what you would expect from the "A List" actors. Martin contributes to the performance that leads to his latest Shopgirl, guiding you through life, love and the pursuit of wisdom, if not happiness. Kline is the straight one, the suit, the conformist of the film, and as such, his performance is clear and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This work deals with life in all aspects. It engenders a true emotional investment in its characters and leaves you with the hope that Humanity is not condemned, after all, it does not matter what you believe in, in the end. <br /> <br /> Everything in everything? This is a delight, with one or two sharp moments, and an easy natural dialogue that attracts him, helping his audience to get a great enjoyment of this work. Definitely worth spending your time, although it may not be the best choice for nightly entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the intelligence he exhibited. It's not typical, and it was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the honesty shown here. Couples and friends hold detailed conversations, which feel and sound completely honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work, and I will add it to the DVD collection soon. <br /> <br /> Rate a 9.1 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
