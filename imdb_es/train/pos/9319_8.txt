....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. the man was quite broad and a shout. I love seeing him interact with Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or whoever he is, clearly he was having a ball and I think he also made it easier for his guests, as long as they knew in advance that he was not a disciplined, 19 kind of production. Relax and stay relaxed was the name of the game there. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of guys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis too. Great moment, old gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades, pure enjoyment of what he was doing. His little sad clown who played was also good, but in a moving way. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's great, since you just bought a set of two DVDs of their '61 shows or something like that. Things back in a loving way for me. I remember seeing him on television at the end of his career when he was finishing the series in 1971 or something like that. <br /> <br /> Check this if you are fanatical or curious. It was a riot.
