I saw this on SBS TV here in Australia last week, where it was titled "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I had subtitles enabled and I think SBS provided their own for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality. <br /> <br /> I just searched for "Laputa" on Wikipedia and confirmed what I suspected ... the floating island of this story is taken from Jonathan Swift's classic novel "The Travels of Gulliver", which was published between early and mid eighteenth century. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an attractive Japanese fairy tale, which has an English. speaking voice-cast I think it's suitable for small children, but it runs in just over two hours, so it may be too long for some, but not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story is about two children looking to find a legendary floating island that has a castle in it. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, the army and the spies who also seek the island, and who seek to capture the children (Sheeta, the girl with the voice of Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy with the voice of James Van Der Beek) to help them to find <br /> <br /> The graphics are magnificent ... a kind of photographic realism at times, especially the masonry scenes illuminated by torches, or the beautiful scenes of bright and sunny days, with white clouds, or fog . <br /> <br /> Recommended.
