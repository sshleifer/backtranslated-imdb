First let me say that I am not from the South but that I am American. I do not love country music, but I can stand it. I would never wear a cowboy hat, but I wear hats. I do not live in a trailer, but I do eat tuna salad and I have a house. What does that have to do with this comment? Very much if you are one of those people who say that only the people of "country" love this movie. This movie is based loosely on the premise of "Amaron y perdieron". James Bridges directs an American love story as real as possible. In an era of Jerry Springer and the "Let's put it out there" mentality, this movie sounds truer than ever. <br /> <br /> Bud is "coming of age" and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle, so he moves into the big city with them. Bud finds himself trapped in the local world of honky tonk for the only escape a blue-collar man can afford. He quickly finds Sissy, who is of similar origin and both have a whirlwind romance full of painful ups and downs. <br /> <br /> (* This plot takes so many turns that you just have to sit down a few minutes before they get hooked.) Marriage is an often overlooked approach. We see The Transition from Single to Married The film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old man, and also highlights the male ego with women and competition. <br /> < br /> Bud is challenged and excited when Micky's puts an electronic bull in. Sissy also has ideas to have fun, but she is quickly reminded that she is married and needs to start "acting like that." The emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive, and the plot continues from there, especially when they are separated (Sissy falls in love with an ex-convict for abuse and cruelty.) She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side. <br /> <br /> How someone can compare Bud with Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me. John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that deserved recognition. It was believable and real. The scene where you shave your beard and you see it for the first time in the bar ... it still makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind that I'm not a big fan of Travolta, but come on, I see why Sissy was kicking his boots so early in the movie. Deb Winger was so real that you found yourself sympathetic to her as she dedicates a note of emotion to Bud, after sneaking in to clean his house during their separation. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was incredible. Wes played by Scott Glenn gave a first level performance that made you hate him and curse him while abusing Sissy. Madolyn Smith-Osborne, as Buds Mistress / girlfriend was so authentic that the great American girls prayed to wake up with flat chests to wear the clothes that were put on the film. My biggest congratulations go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud's aunt and uncle. They looked like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas and, however small their role, they made the film much bigger and more realistic. Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton contest and the unforgettable scene in which Bud and his aunt are left out after the death of one of the characters. The dialogue between them is moving. <br /> <br /> If you can see this for what it is, a true American love story. So I recommend you take it for what it is ... a movie before it is the moment that gave us voyeurism in a different world to ours but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. If this world sounds similar to yours, then you will enjoy it much more. Finally, the music, however dated, will surely send you to the past if you are over 30 years old.
