OH WOW. I saw this film at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and were available for questions later. What a beautiful movie! Although settled in Ireland in the midst of Catholic / Protestant antagonism, the story could have happened anywhere between two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how quickly people get carried away when given the opportunity to vent their hatred and anger is woven beautifully with a moving love story full of humor and fun. If this is not collected in the USA. UU., It would be really unfortunate. <br /> <br /> As for the stars and support players ... FIRST RATE. They say they call Orla Brady the Irish Meryl Streep. It is my opinion that she is better than Meryl Streep. They should call Meryl the American Orla Brady! And, the constant and powerful representation of Liam Cunningham of a simple and private man absorbed in a political war was brilliant. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS MOVIE.
