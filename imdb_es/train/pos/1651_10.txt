['I saw the presentation of this on PBS in the United States when it was originally issued in 1988 (?). Assuming that the miniseries was available on a DVD, I bought the first editions of the three books last year. Since then I&#39;ve been looking for the series in movie sites on the Internet. Today I found this website. I will give up the search. <br /><br /> I would also like to buy this complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. After buying the DVDs, I would read each book and then watch the episodes in that book. That&#39;s what I did with John LeCarre&#39;s Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty&#39;s Texas ranger trilogy. <br /><br /> Does anyone have any suggestions for large books or series of books that became very good TV miniseries, or series of movies, that are now available on DVD?']
