Intelligent, ironic and exciting, "The Invisible Man" stood out in 2000 among the usual Sci-Fi lineup, balancing Farscape's fantastic art direction and, at times, the melodramatic script with deep-rooted, kinetic and modern dialogues. The program was between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" in the credibility meter, but there was no denying the fact that the characters of "I-Man" went beyond the caricature. Even the characters that bordered on predictability, such as the Guardian, Officer and Eberts, were given a pardon for the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and changed elegantly, most notably by the team of writers and directors of the revolving door. In effect they are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and science only sometimes borders on the totally incredible. The low points of the program are still entertaining, and I have never seen pilot episodes so tense. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi must be congratulated, and fans have the right to demand a full DVD edition of the program. Every time I run into a marathon of "Hercules: Legendary Journeys" in science fiction, I roll my eyes and sigh, lamenting the excitement and possibility of the science fiction television that represented the "Invisible Man" and his ilk.
