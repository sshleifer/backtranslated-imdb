I thought the original of this movie was quaint and charming, besides having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to decipher it. <br /> <br /> As I had already seen the original, when I saw it on Sci Fi Channel: I do not know if this remake was deliberately done for Sci Fi; I knew what it was like in the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi as a character actor, I wanted to see how he would achieve it. <br /> <br /> The writers / producers, etc., modernized the film a little while trying to explain the difficult situation of the "extraterrestrials". "(They could no longer reproduce their own kind and they needed help) using the same pseudoscience that has gotten into their ears in the 90s. Maybe it added a bit of brightness to the movie, or not. <br /> <br /> This film, film This production acquires a more sinister advantage than the original The original ended with a confrontation between the young and the foreigner and an understanding of the issues took place, although the problem of the foreigner was not resolved. br /> <br /> I remember that in this remake, the woman became quite hostile towards Burgi / Alien, I think it could have ended better, but the end is just the end, and the thread is a swollen thread, being the basic Pulp Science Fiction from 1958. Many great science fiction stories were written in the 50s and some of them were even shot to film. <br /> <br /> This is a great thing to watch as a rainy day or something well, I rate it highly because of all the rows Sci Fi kes of 50, this went well. I really enjoyed this a lot. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really wants to see this story told WELL, I suggest the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
