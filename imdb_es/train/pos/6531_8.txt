I really liked this movie ... it was cute. I enjoyed it, but if you did not, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played very well with Nancy Drew, although she does not look very much like books. Ancient costumes are rare when you see them in modern times, but it looks good on them. For me, the rich girls did not have outfits that made them look rich. I mean, it seems that they bought all the clothes, blindfolded, at a garage sale and decided to put it all together. All the outfits were in bad taste, especially when they wore the moccasins in their normal attire. I do not want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely was not. Just go to the theater and see it! You will enjoy it!
