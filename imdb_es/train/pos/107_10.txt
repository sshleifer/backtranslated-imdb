Lars Von Triers Europe is an extremely good movie. How is that? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling a story, at least he had it with Europe. For me, the whole movie was like an experience, even if I saw it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete, REAL and moving film piece that most of the films in the list of the 250 best. I also think that it is perhaps the most terrifying, most gothic and complete movie that exists. Well, there are other good ones too, but this is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in history.
