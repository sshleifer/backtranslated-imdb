This movie needs to be seen. the truest image of what is happening in the world that I have seen since Darwin's Nightmare. Go see it! And if you are lucky enough to have it open in your city, be sure to see it on the big screen instead of DVD. The writing is clear and the direction is good enough for ideas to be presented, although they are not perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is also good. It's inspiring that John Cusack made this movie, and I think he had to use some of his money to do it. It is a wild and absurd journey, obviously done without the resources I needed, but still succeeds. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher has not shown the guts to say what this movie says.
