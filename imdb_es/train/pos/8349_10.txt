The most notorious film of Depardieu is this (1974) pioneer of Bertrand Blier. It features many highly sexual scenes on the verge of an X rating, including one by Jeanne Moreau making a hot version of the Jules and Jim in 1970, with two furry French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There is no such thing as a sacred territory in this movie; Everything is fair play. <br /> <br /> It is very strange that Americans do not like this movie very much, while many French people I know consider it a classic. Something about this goes against what Americans have been programmed to like. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two perverted and perverted hippies with many sexual insecurities, mistreating women and committing petty crimes. . They are in favor of "kicks" and "anti-communist", Euro-community and vague "freedom". Blier satirizes the hell of these two boys and, at the same time, makes bourgeois society seem much more ridiculous. Best of all, however, is the way in which the wonderful score of Stephane Grappelli conveys the restless soul of the drifters, the deeper subconscious consciousness or "higher ideal" that motivates all the follies in which they engage.
