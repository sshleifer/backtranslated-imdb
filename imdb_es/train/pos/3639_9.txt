This movie, for me, is about the family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself, but also for his family. I can not begin to tell you how I could tell my daughter that Dad was going to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes and the Kansas City Chiefs. She would think it was the best, as Morris's son did. Living dreams with the family is what it is about. I think that only a father who has a close relationship with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
