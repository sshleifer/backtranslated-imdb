I LOVE Jack's jokes like 'The cliché is ...' or 'On the cliché cliche, black and fat skin, a bit creepy ...'. It's just funny! Daniel is starting to catch up! Luckily Jack is no longer in the team (in some way) or if it had not been a sarcastic madness. I love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I must admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I'm starting to get facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It's just theoretically possible and exciting ... Oops! Its going again !!! I'm sorry, I'm also starting to pick up on Carter's traits, and all this is driving my NUTZ parents! Well, to conclude, I think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially if they continue to package the episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so on! ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!
