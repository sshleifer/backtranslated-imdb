I have seen this movie at least fifty times and, after having seen it last week for the first time in a long time, still the YES. WE FEEL. <br /> <br /> The story itself was amazing, but it came alive thanks to Spielberg's experience and the fabulous Elenco includes Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserved an Oscar nomination for her brief but powerful portrayal of Nettie. <br /> <br /> You will experience every human emotion as you watch this movie. I laughed, I cried, and I got angry. Like most major films, the Academy examined him with a large number of nominations but without victories. But this movie, without a doubt, is definitely one of the best movies of all time.
