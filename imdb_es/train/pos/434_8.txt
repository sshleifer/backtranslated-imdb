Development of nice characters in a very cool environment. Being a man, I probably am not qualified to fully understand it, but they do a good job at establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the beginning. It is not as grim as it really was and the treatment of the women was probably even more severe. What makes this work is a wonderful chemistry between the main characters. Everyone has their own "thing" with which they face. Once they leave the rain and leave the spider webs, they begin to interact and little by little lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it was not for cheap comedy when I could have done it. He did not try to teach us a lesson. People who seem completely without merit are very well developed human beings who come to see the light. I had a little problem with the character of Alfred Molina who had such an epiphany, but, in this world, it had to happen. Good acting everywhere with something positive that takes place in the lives of some pretty good people.
