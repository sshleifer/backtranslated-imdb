I'm usually skeptical about watching movies or miniseries based on novels because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I think it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?) <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional. I can not describe how much I enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> The configuration of the location ... I was waiting to see the houses and cabins that I imagined in my mind: what I saw on the screen was a little different. However, it was not enough for me not to like the miniseries. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have done so. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
