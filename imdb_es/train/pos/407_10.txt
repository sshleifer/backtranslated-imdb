Oh my God ... Just give me a minute to breathe. This movie takes you on an incredible journey and will not let you go until the last blow on your face. This is the movie for fans of Stormriders and such. Legend of Zu was beautifully created, although I did not like some things, they used many confrontations. I wanted to see the real person fight but, well ... some small disappointments, and I really did not like it until I saw it again, when you understand it more, it totally kicks A **! I encourage anyone who has wanted to see a true Asian movie to watch this movie. I give this movie one of my highest grades. Go see her when she leaves the United States!
