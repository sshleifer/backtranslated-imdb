['It is mainly the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the contest, but usually the directors start from a historical fact to talk about something else, or also show the period before or after this fact, here everything happens during the two days in which the revolution acts. It could also be seen as a kind of documentary. The film focuses on these two people, showing that they were normal, not as common heroes, because the revolution comes from the people. Although it was made from the military army from the title, it can be understood that they were only &quot;captains&quot; as the main characters. Colors and nice lights throughout the film, excellent work for the director, since it is her first film and does not fall into the banal form. Well demonstrated emotions and passion of people and crowd. The character of Maia (main) is well done and there is also a good performance for Stefano Accorsi, able to show the limits of Maia, this is not a hero.']
