One of the funniest maries I've ever played. The levels are creative, there are fluid controls and good graphics for your time. There is also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes, the levels become frustrating, and if you put aside some of the difficult levels and still, you need to achieve more achievements to fight a boss, it can be annoying. Another complaint is the angle of the camera; Although it works pretty well most of the time, it can be a pain in certain situations. if you are a big fan of mario; this one is for you. Even if you are not a big fan of him, I would still recommend this one. It's a great game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very satisfying. Good to play in short bursts of time. it is almost certain that he will maintain his interest; It sure is mine!
