It is difficult to overcome this movie in several ways. Everything works very well here; The casting, the acting, the script and the cinematography are all first class. For the viewer, it is a moving and violent story of love and human redemption. For the film critic, there is a lot of sharp technique and technical merit. There are some tactical errors, and as has been discussed in the boards, the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the training angle of CIA agents. However, I took the ending as more poignant due to the fact that, instead of following the pragmatic approach of the CIA agent, Creasy basically recommends his soul to the Ultimate without considering the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it makes sense or not pragmatic. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and simply overcomes the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which in reality results in redemption for both himself and the innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is worth seeing if the genre attracts you. An excellent soundtrack, a great writing, an impeccable cast and solid performances in all areas make this one of the 100 best movies (or better).
