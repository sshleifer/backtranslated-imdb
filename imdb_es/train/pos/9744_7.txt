"Yes, Georgio" is a cheerful and funny movie / comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie that I liked to watch more than once. Some reviewers suggested that if one wanted to enjoy Pavarotti, they would probably be better served by picking up an opera DVD. Although, a full opera could be a better representation of the operatic talents of Pavarotti, often, an opera requires costumes and has narrative lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his voice when speaking and exhibit a personality and character in a way that an opera would not. <br /> <br /> Many critics seemed to find the story incredible; I do not agree People with enormous talent can be self-centered and charming, charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from each other often get information about themselves and grow positively by interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen for themselves. Both Georgio and Pamela open up more to unexplored parts of themselves in relation to each other. <br /> <br /> Relax and get carried away by a visual and auditory movie with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. The final scenes of Puccini's Turandot are only worth the time to get there.
