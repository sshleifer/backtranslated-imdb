['Being a big fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I discovered that they had made a movie together and that my mission in life was to watch it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this movie far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was prepared for brave but not so satisfying performances, but I am delighted to say that both managed to keep me enthralled and believe in the story as it went. Moon Child has the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious and heartbreaking moments. I can not say that I have ever cried more in a movie and these more tender moments are admirably interpreted by the couple, in my opinion, demonstrating their abilities as actors. The fight scenes are absolutely impressive and, although to begin with there are some moments of uncertainty, you rush to get into the movie and start to bond with the characters. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.']
