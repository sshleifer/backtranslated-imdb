I had no problem with the movie, which I thought was pretty good. It's the video of the LAPD crime scene that bothered me. I wonder if Lion's Gate REALLY thought that the general audience would want to see people who were brutally beaten to death and blood everywhere. Sorry, Lion's Gate, this was an INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA! <br /> <br /> Returning to the movie: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was a sordid, mistreated women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and he is desperately involved in drugs. His connection with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous murders of the Land of Wonders. Exactly how much was Holmes involved in the murders? We may never know the full truth of the story (Nash is still alive and a free man), but the film does a good job nonetheless.
