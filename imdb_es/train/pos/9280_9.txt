In Iran, women are officially banned from male sporting events. In June 2005, Iran's national soccer team plays a major game against Bahrain at the Azadi Stadium for the World Cup qualification. A group of Iranian girls and lovers of football dresses as children and tried unsuccessfully to enter the stadium being arrested. <br /> <br /> Football (and the Flamengo team), the beach and the cinema are my great passions; therefore, I loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for soccer. Director Jafar Panahi, from "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle", filmed this movie the day Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most charming films I have ever seen. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
