My, Kasi Lemmings is certainly a fair-looking woman. This movie is a lost gem, a mockumentary of satire from the Hip Hop scene of the early 90s, when MC Hammer had just disappeared on that good night. We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark on their picaresque journey of possible riches and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, in the end, they finish their journey not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and much less naive. This is one of the best movies anyone has ever heard of, but it's the kind of movie you love or hate, very much like "Company Man" in this sense. I consider this film to be like the 1000 islands of northern New York: it is a wonderful little secret that you must keep for yourself.
