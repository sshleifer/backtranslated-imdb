This is a Jackie Chan movie above average, due to the fantastic ending and great humor, however, apart from that, it is nothing special. All the characters are great, and the movie is entertaining, besides, Jackie Chan is simply amazing in this! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had fantastic chemistry together, and both are very funny! And I thought that the main opponent looked really threatening! However, the dubbing was simply terrible! The development of the character is above average for this kind of thing! And the main fight is just fantastic! In addition, some of the hits that Jackie takes in this are hard! There is a lot of really silly and ridiculous humor in this, but it amused me, and the ending is hilarious! Also, all the characters are quite nice. It looks pretty cheap, but overall it's very well done, and although it does not have the amount of fights that you would expect from a Jackie Chan movie, it does enough to keep you watching, and one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie (Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), they are playing with a rifle and it is fired. This is a film by Jackie Chan above average, due to the fantastic ending and the great humor, however, apart from that it's nothing special, it's still worth seeing! The address is good. Jackie Chan does a good job here with a solid camera job, fantastic angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace for the most part. The acting is very good! Jackie Chan is amazing as always, and he's amazing here, he's extremely friendly, hilarious, as he always does some crazy stunts, he had fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, kicked him in the ass and played this wonderful arrogant character, It was incredible! I just wish they stopped folding it! (Jackie's rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is fun as Jackie's best friend, I really liked him, he is also a very good martial artist. Rest of the cast do well, I suppose. In general it is well worth the watch! *** of 5
