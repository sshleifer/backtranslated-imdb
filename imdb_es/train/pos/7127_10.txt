Wonderful movie about the trials and tribulations of World War II in England. What makes this film so good is the touch of the human element. This film is definitely the tradition of classics of the British line such as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As is the case with this film, we see the desperation of people in times of war. <br /> <br /> Here the performances stand out, especially by the embittered John Thaw, who is assigned a child who has been evacuated. The bombing of London. <br /> <br /> We soon see why this child wet his bed. He comes from a lunatic mother who has mistreated him terribly. <br /> <br /> The old man approaches the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to London and looks for him only to find a tragedy. Literally, he kidnaps the child and can convince someone higher that the child is better with him than being in a child's home. <br /> <br /> The image is very good because it deals with and is based on intimate relationships.
