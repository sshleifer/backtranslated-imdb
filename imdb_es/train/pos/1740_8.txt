This movie was not so much promoted here in Greece, although it got good actors, a great script and a good picture, it was not the so-called "blockbuster" movie in my country. The film itself is very powerful, it is the difficult moment that had to cross a newcomer when he returns to his hometown after being released from a prison time of 5 years (drugs) The end is quite sad ... Mourikis he is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it quite well ... Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and, of course, Hatzisavvas is for once again close to excellence ... 7 out of 10 because few Greek films can make such an impression!
