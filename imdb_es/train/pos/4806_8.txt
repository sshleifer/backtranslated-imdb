Director Jean-Marc Valle gives life to a new side of the story of Victoria and Albert. The superficial thinking of most people about Queen Victoria is that of a woman who reigned for several decades and lived her mourning life. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the lead role, as it gives audiences a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, the ascension to the throne and the first years. Victoria de Blunt, both fresh and restricted throughout the film. His strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All the actors defend themselves well, including Miranda Richardson, in what could have been a throwing role. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a story of dramatic arcs and moments of "acting" histrionics, the story is still interesting enough. so it's worth seeing. There are some historical freedoms that have been taken by the writing of the screen, the film tries to stay true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and real structure of the period. The scenery and the costumes are outstanding. <br /> <br /> This film will be much appreciated by the draughtsmen of history, the dramas of the time and Blunt and the other actors. I recommend wholeheartedly. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
