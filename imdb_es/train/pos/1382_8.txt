Not everything is said in this excellent first feature of Céline Sciamma. The friendship, the "want to fit", the first sexual feelings ... All this and much more is sublimated through the scenes of synchronized swimming underwater. <br /> <br /> The three girls in the film try to find and express their personality in a very different way. It's a much less violent approach to understanding the teenage years compared to, say, "Thirteen," but it's still a worthwhile trip. <br /> <br /> You have to see it, and leave all the preconceived cinematic ideas of the United States at the door. The soundtrack is A +, by the way. <br /> <br /> Bon cinéma!
