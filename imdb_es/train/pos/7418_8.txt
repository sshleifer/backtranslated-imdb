"Shower" is a story about loyalty, about the unstoppable advance of the modern world to the detriment of more traditional and more human ways of life. A man forced to choose between his successful career in business, his life in the big city, his wife and his retarded younger brother. The eternal doubt between what we WANT to do and what we MUST do. Modern China versus the old one. The public baths with their meetings, their cricket fights against shopping malls and the skyscraper. Many old men and women who are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... although one of them is killing the other. <br /> <br /> Tender, touching, full of funny moments and bittersweet moments. The sensitive will cry and laugh alike. The actors are huge, especially the one who plays the role of the retarded child; and Yang Zhang does a good job, easy, simple, letting the story flow by itself. <br /> <br /> My rate: 8/10
