This show is witty, colorful, dark but fun, modern and somehow clean. The cast, including an impressive rotation of special guests (ie, Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is electric. It has murder, romance, family, and zombies, without ever being a caricature ... Somehow. You really connect with these characters. All production is an unlikely magical act that left me, something like a skeptic if I say it myself, totally absorbed and coming back for more every Wednesday night. I just reread this and it sounds a little like someone paid me to write it. It's really that good. I just heard a rumor that it was being canceled, so I thought I was going to send a flare of goodwill. This is one of those programs that goes unnoticed because network suits can not figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Do yourself a big favor, if you have not done it yet, and enjoy this gem while it lasts. OK so one more thing. This show is smart. What that means is that every chair critic / "writer" in Hollywood will insert a sticky pencil so you know what to do before sitting down to defend yourself, defending yourself with a "I could have written that" kind of speech to absolutely nobody in his solitary. Room renovated in Hollywood hotel. In other words: internet. This is a general interest / anonymous website. Before giving your Wednesday television hour to the Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model reruns, or anything else these Internet "critics" do not comment on, go over my favorite one. It's fun. Good fun without pretensions.
