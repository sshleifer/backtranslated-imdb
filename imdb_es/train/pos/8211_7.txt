Since I had never seen the original Dirty Harry, I judged this movie on a clean slate. And I must say, I enjoyed it a lot. Sure, some of the performances of Sondre Locke made me feel a little grumpy, but hey, it was the 80's. But even if you can not overcome it (and I almost can not) or your revenge killings (which seemed a little ... exaggerated; P), it's worth it just for Dirty Harry. Or, at least, the bull dog that affectionately calls 'MeatHead': P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
