The motivation of Goebbels to go back was not explored. After the outbreak of Stalingrad, the Reich decided to go for "total war". This is mentioned in the movie. Part of this was to use women in the war effort, which Germany had not done to a large extent so far. A massacre of SS women would have confronted Goebbels with a public relations disaster of massive proportions. His preference was to make the problem disappear as quietly as possible, on the grounds that Jewish men could always be arrested later. I understand that most survived the war. <br /> <br /> His other problem was that Berlin 'Red' had never been so enthusiastic about the Nazi cause and had to be handled with caution. Again, a massacre of women could have cost the Nazis the mediocre level of support they had in their capital city. <br /> <br /> It was interesting that most of the SS uniforms showed patches that indicated that the men who were wearing them were not of German nationality, but were of German origin in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia.
