This is a movie for entertainment; I did not think the world made social comments about a small movie. Personally, I find this movie fun, bold and memorable. It is a fantasy not unlike an ash girl who becomes a princess. This film was made very well, I could add, in the 70's, one of the best cinematographic experiences with the possibility of mentioning a person's sexuality. This film is not about a person who is homosexual or not, but about love, in all its strange ways. This film shows some of the realities of being gay in the 70s in Hollywood or California. Pretty boys are being cared for by not so pretty older men. Women who had to remain deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career. The bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> THEN the fantasy begins !! Let's mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have? Well, this movie, which in ANY way was better than that sad remodeling "The Next Big Thing". Maybe someone should have asked the whole team to watch this movie and then try to do better. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the 70s and it still brings a smile to my lips now. I advise everyone who wants a fun and tender movie to cuddle up with popcorn and have fun. Some people need to lighten! And this is the movie you should do it with! <br /> <br />
