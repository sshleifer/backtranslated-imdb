Heh, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight to an 18-year-old comic-book movie rated 5.9, would you call me crazy? That is just to get your attention. Every day I meet people complaining that there are no good movies, that seem to know only the latest box office hits. It is never bad to search and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those who can not easily be outdated, in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> The negative reviews complained mainly about the "messy" history of DT. But I think the story is quite clear, and I had no problem following it. I did not see the comic books, but I am not a big fan of comics in the United States, but I appreciate the cinema and the first level presentations. Maybe the expectations of most people were too high with respect to the story that would tell. But, if you watch a movie that brings Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect? I had some scratches on my head, and I can not help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? The main role, although not as competent as it seems, was still able to attract and enchant the public. Madonna was more express, less than "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was funny and a prodigy for himself. Apparently, he is bold enough to become sarcastic in his previously successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro that hit our stomachs to make us laugh. And many thanks to the makeup. <br /> <br /> For me it's not bad at all. The surreal feeling really got me.
