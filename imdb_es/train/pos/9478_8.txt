This is a nice little movie with a beautiful story, which plays the most important role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It is a quite intriguing dramatic story, with a romance also present in it. The story is told slowly, but this works very well for its construction. The characters are nice and well represented by their actors. Normally, I'm not too fanatical about the Asian acting style, but the acting in this movie was just good. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is quite different in its approach and style from other genre films, produced in the west. In a way, this film is already more advanced with its approach than western films made during the same period. <br /> <br /> He just wished that the movie his visual style had been a little better. For a film that is considered a kind of artistic film, this film certainly lacks some sequences with good looks. Obviously, this was a fairly cheap movie to do and it was done quite generically. It's not that this is a bad thing, it just prevents this film from distinguishing itself and rising above the genre. <br /> <br /> But hey, this movie has to do with its well-constructed story and the characters that are in it. In this sense, this film certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
