The origins of this film are a mystery to me, since I only know as much as IMDB before renting it. I guess before "Starship Troopers", "Killshot" was one of the countless airless pilots who never reached the network, cable or otherwise. The new title of "Kill Shot" is included comically in the opening sequence, the first of many fast tracks that this was never intended for the cinema. The quick cuts, the cheesy music of "Melrose Place" and the short 2 seconds spontaneous shots of the main actors let you know what you do. <br /> <br /> And I do not care at all. I rented this movie watching the repackaging that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be fun to see them in a movie, in addition to the SciFi parody of Starship Troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion ). , it's not such a hot movie - but that's another criticism). After looking at IMDB, my roommate and I guessed that the pilot was dragged after the apparent success of the Troopers and Richards race (see the references of Bond-Girl and Wild Things here). They released a sex scene with a supporting character to achieve the coveted R status, coveted in the suspense video rental sections, that is. In any case, they should have left it unqualified if you try to sell it in the suspense / softcore porn section. <br /> <br /> In general, it is entertaining. Although I hate ruining the fun of telling you that he is a television pilot. That was the biggest pull while I watched: when you wait for a movie and you get a TV show, the differences between them become clearer than usual. <br /> <br /> Would you rent it again? No. Would you watch this television show? Well, why not? It's better than Baywatch. And their few attempts to reach all demographic groups would have worked well in the mid-90s. Symbolic black guy (who is gay to avoid the TV taboo of interracial dating), Asian Asian (Japanese, I guess by the name Koji ) is more expert in science and computers than in talking to women, a beautiful and intelligent Latino student of pre-medical education who has everything in his favor, except his family's bank account, this program probably would have worked well. <br /> <br /> But as a movie, it just breaks me. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was bound to be. It was a very enjoyable evening, and that's all I ask for rents.
