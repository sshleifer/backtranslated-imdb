The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexuated. The things that were only insinuated in the novel are shown on the screen for some strange reason. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything right? Apart from that, this is of very good quality. All the actors do wonderful works giving life to their characters. For shallow women, it's worth looking at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing in history. If it were Helen, I would have conveniently forgotten that I was still married the moment I saw him ... <br /> <br /> A kind of spoiler. The final scene is a fun investment of what happened in the book.
