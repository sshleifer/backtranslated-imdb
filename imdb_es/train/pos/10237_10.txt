This is one of the best films that come out of the 'New Wave' of Hong Kong that began with "ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain" by Tsui Hark. Tsui set a tone for the New Wave approach in the martial arts film that almost all the directors of the New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a fact; namely, the approach to such films thereafter would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. "Burning Paradise" put an end to all that, and with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> It's not like there's no humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as in the beginning of the old Buddhist priest who somehow manages a quick sensation of the young nubile prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. But this is how humans are, not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time. <br /> <br /> When irony is finally introduced into the film, it is as unpleasant as possible, emanating from the "abbot" of Red Lotus Temple, which is a study on pure nihilism, as never before recorded in a movie. He is the very incarnation of Satan of Milton's "Paradise Lost": "Better to rule in Hell than to serve in heaven!" And if he can not get to Satan's hell soon enough, he will turn the world around him into a living hell that can rule. <br /> <br /> That is the reason that underlines the brutal violence of many of the images here. : It's not that the Abbot only wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel completely hopeless, to accept his nihilism as a reality that encompasses everything. Therefore, there is a definite sense in the scenes of the Red Temple that perhaps there is no other reality outside the Temple itself: it has become everything in the universe, and the Abbot, who claims to dominate the infinite power , is in charge. br /> <br /> Of course, fortunately, the movie does not end there. Although there are losses, the human will to be simply ordinarily human prevails at last. (If you want to know how, watch the movie!) However, there is no doubt that when we watch this movie, we visit hell. Hopefully, we are not witnesses of our own life after life; but we certainly feel punished for the experience, and somehow better for it above all.
