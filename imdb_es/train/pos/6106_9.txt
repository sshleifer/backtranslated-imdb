When it comes to the erotic genre, I'm lucky to spend the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to see. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I love you, do not touch me) directed two very strong leading actors, Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery, in this exciting thriller. Kira convinces as "Kim", a sweet and innocent romantic novelist who finds herself trapped in the seduction network of Doug Jeffery "The Man", a handsome stranger. Kira loses control of her inhibitions on the role, and as an actress, giving what could have simply been another depth and credibility. I think it's his best performance so far. And the address of Julie Davis is a great gift for the erotic.
