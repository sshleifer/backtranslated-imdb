'' The Sentinel '' is one of the best horror films that have been made in the film industry. I think it's very scary how very few movies really are. Alison Parker is a model with some fame. She goes out with a lawyer named Michael Lerman, and has as best friend another model named Jennifer. Everything was great in her life, until she decides to live alone for a while and rents a beautiful old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is your neighbors, who are very, VERY strange. Suddenly, Alison begins to have health problems and faints as often; She also remembers some painful facts about her past that make her have nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason, and it has to do with the new house that lives ... <br /> <br /> Personally, I find "The Sentinel" a very spooky movie, and together with "The Exorcist" there are two of the most terrifying movies I've seen, when we discovered that Alison's house is only occupied by the priest and herself, my blood froze! It's also horrible to see that she needs to go blind at the end of the movie to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world.
