The Sentinel presents a kind of race and a clich√© suspense / mystery, but it rises with good performance and tense rhythm. These stories have already gone through most of the permutations we can handle, so what we have left is how good the performance is, how clever the settings are and how bad, how well designed the main plot is, etc. ..... so the Sentinel does a solid job given its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland maintain a good courage and attitudes on the screen. Eva Longoria (the first time I see her on the screen) gives us a satisfactory support. The whole side of the history of the story is absolutely unlikely, knocking it down a bit, but it deserves slackness. It's worth seeing if you like the genre.
