I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful in it. Play the role of the modern magician to the hilt. (And it's absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped inspire a role-playing game that I really enjoy, Mage: The Awakening. I have shown it at several parties after LARP, and it is always a great success. <br /> <br /> The love of D & D and the detachment of Jeff aside, is not exactly a masterpiece, but it is well made and is very nice. The plot moves fast and is committed to its simplicity, the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget, and the script, although not stellar, was not so badly done, and corny in all the right places. A good way to spend an afternoon.
