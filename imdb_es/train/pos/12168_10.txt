"A Guy Thing" may not be a classic, but it sure is a good and funny comedy. The plot centers on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and Becky (Julia Stiles) lies naked in her bed. Before he can figure out what happened, he rushes Becky out of his apartment because his fiancee Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. After that, as you can imagine, chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> Almost all the scenes of "A Guy Thing" laughs. The funniest moments come from when Paul imagines what could happen if he tells Karen. Selma Blair is a truly talented comedian, and the worst thing about this movie is that it is not used too much. Although, she turns out to be more fun than Stiles' character, which is not really that interesting. Of course, not all comedies are perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "A Guy Thing" is not a classic, but it's not bad either, 7/10.
