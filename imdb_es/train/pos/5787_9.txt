Much is dated in this episode (as in most episodes of the Twilight Zone), such as the incredibly "uniform" sexist military of the Woman. And some things are so incredible, like the easy availability of clean water. Still, consider the year it was made and the time, and quickly understand why this episode is so special while you watch it. He has a good sense of hope, something that is missing in many areas of Twilight, as well as an interesting female character (although he rarely speaks), something rare in the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a great example of how Twilight Zone, in just over 20 minutes, could accumulate more emotion and drama than most of today's two-hour movies. And it's great to see two people who became American icons so early in their careers.
