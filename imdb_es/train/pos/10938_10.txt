I rarely find a film so complete that I must talk about it immediately. This movie is definitely one of the best entertainment available and it is very authentic. By chance I saw the dubbed version, but right now I'm on my way to grab the DVD remaster with the original dialogue in Chinese. Even so, the dubbing did not intervene and, at times, offered a very funny humor: "The Poison Clan moves the world!" <br /> <br /> Storytelling remains true to Chinese methods of intrigue, suspense, and interpersonal relationships. You can wait twists and turns as you reveal the identities of the 5 poisons and an expert rhythm. <br /> <br /> The martial arts fighting choreography belongs to a class of its own and must be seen to be believed. It's like watching a fight between real animals, but interpreted from their own forms of arcane martial arts. Such skill level among the cast is unsurpassed in today's cinema. <br /> <br /> The combination provides a serious dose of ancient Chinese culture and I recommend it only on the basis of the film's genuine attempt to tell a war council. The history of art and the control of its execution. ... Of course, if you just want to see people sticking together, along with the crude forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
