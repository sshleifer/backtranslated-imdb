Ride with the Devil, like Brokeback Mountain, by Ang Lee, is a film of great aesthetic and historical importance. Movie lovers should watch it at least twice, since its artistic nuance is worthy of being understood. <br /> <br /> A perfect work of art, amazing depth of humanity. I really do not remember another war movie, it will capture you, it will change your existing conception of history and politics, it will restore your belief in humanity. After seeing so many murders, so many sufferings, you do not feel numb, but you treasure more the bond between human beings. The performances of the actors pursue your heart, music drives your mind. Some shoots are not just some pictures, they transcend themselves and become the vision of the soul Such is the true sense that the film is a genre of art. <br /> <br /> A movie like this does not need long comments or reviews, everything it says for itself. Ovation to the cast that includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the director of photography and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!
