In general, I would have to say that I liked the movie. Some of the fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. Seriously. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene, you see that one of the fighters on the ground is laughing. Otherwise, Sammo perfectly copies the fighting movements of Bruce Lee. 5 out of 10 stars
