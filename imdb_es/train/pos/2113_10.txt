The location of the store around the corner is indicated with precision at the beginning of the film, Balta Street in Budapest, but it could be anywhere. The small number of sets reflects a medium European design, but it could be a shop just around the corner. The film is not about Budapest or the leather goods retail business, but about the ups and downs of love, which are reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous. The letters to each other are full of hope, aspiration and romance, and the story unravels to unite these two aspects beautifully. Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the store, is having problems with his wife, she only has a voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her leather clothes. Mr. Pirovitch's life focuses on his wife and children. Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' to a girl at Christmas. You even feel that the quiet Flora Katchuck, while staying at home with her mother, dreams of someone. <br /> <br /> The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. It's one of those quiet movies that pays again and again, simple but profound. The dialogue reflects the character of speech that is not common these days. <br /> <br /> The whole performance is magnificent. Even minor characters like the waiter in the cafeteria and the policeman in the street are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan face each other perfectly. He was really getting into his step as an actor at that time and it gives him a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was an excellent actress and little appreciated these days. Some of his other films are worthy of being captured. Like Mr. Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. Your moment of truth is very moving. Golden stars are everywhere for artists. <br /> <br /> It is a very used phrase that is not done as they used to do it (the vague remodeling of 'You have Got Mail' was terrible) but in this case it is true. The director Lubitsch is not in luck mode, but he presented a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.
