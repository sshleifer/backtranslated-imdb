I never thought that an old caricature would bring tears to my eyes! The first time I bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I really wanted to see Casper's first caricature titled The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next caricature, there's Good Boos To-Night (1948), It did break! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was after watching Casper's fox die! I never saw anything like that in the other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressing, I could not see it again. It's like watching Lassie die at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic, but it's too much for us, like the old cartoon fans, like me! If I wanted to see something old and classic, I prefer to see something happy and fun. But when I think of this Casper cartoon, I think of my cats!
