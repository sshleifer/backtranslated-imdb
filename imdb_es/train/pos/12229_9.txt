For me, there is something so attractive and nostalgic about low-budget science fiction. As a child in the 50's that's all there was. In 1957 I saw "The First Man Into Space" in a cinema with my dad. It featured Marshall Thompson and other poor lazy people who got the lead role. It is also a space mission that has gone bad, where the astronaut becomes a grizzly killer. Scared good and abundance out of me. The memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives inside me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost a new version only in a glorious color ... it is where the scenes were well lit. I just love it for what it is ... a little more than an hour of dark scenes, disgusting noises and that spooky music. Bravo
