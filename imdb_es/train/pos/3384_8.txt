My evaluation: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Compared to the film today without a brain (only action and special effect and nothing new about ideas), "Soylent Green" asks something that does not exist today: Think. <br /> <br /> Well, it would not be a great surprise One day humans eat "cookies" that are created with a human body. With everything that happens on this planet, and to see how people are so indifferent to everyone, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie has some age but the idea behind the movie is real again. Rich in Paradise, another in hell. Well, good luck today are TV and idiocy as "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> TV is a good brainwashing. It is a pity to see that the intelligence of humans has not progressed like technologies. Since you wrote everything for. <br /> <br /> If you like reality TV, this movie is not for you. If you believe all politicians the same too. If you do not like it, ask yourself about the present and the future, never look at this movie.
