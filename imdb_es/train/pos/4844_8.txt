One of my favorite movies I saw for the first time when I was about 10 years old, which probably tells you a lot about the type of humor. Although dating humor definitely has a charm about it. Expect to see the usual jokes of Askey and Murdoch so popular in their day, with many interesting and extravagant characters. The parrot lady, the couple that is getting married and they are in trouble with "her", and my favorite, the station manager, "No one knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it is going ..." Interestingly, the ghost train was written by Arnold Ridley of Dads Army fame (soldier Godfrey the doctor) Watch him on a rainy Sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile.
