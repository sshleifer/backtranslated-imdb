This is a well-directed film by John Cromwell who was not a great director but who made some excellent films, including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could handle, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and frustrated love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to see it on a DVD like I've never seen it before and be a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her first greats. So I bought it. Well, it looked good, but I'm sorry to say that his London cockney accent made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the best cinematographic actresses, make no mistake, but here she did one. It was impossible to take his character seriously. It was not as frightening as Dick Van Dyke's cockney accent 'Mary Poppins', but it was close. <br /> <br /> In the other important role was Leslie Howard and he did it excellently. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. The supporting actors acquitted themselves well. It's worth looking in spite of Ms. Davis's vocal gymnastics.
