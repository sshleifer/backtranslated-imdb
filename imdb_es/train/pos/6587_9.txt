The Master Blackmailer, based on the short story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", is the first Sherlock Holmes story with Jeremy Brett that I have seen. The story is interesting and dark. The movie has a sad and sad feeling, but it is quite entertaining (with some especially funny scenes). <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson try to uncover the identity of an illusive blackmailer who has been ruining some of England's most prominent families by publishing private letters that, in a way another, they will destroy their lives. Finally, they discover that he is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art seller", after the few tragic consequences for the victims who could not pay. Next, our heroes must help Lady Eva Blackwell, who must pay a sum that is out of her reach or, otherwise, her next marriage will definitely be canceled. The scene in which Holmes and Watson assault the house of Milverton is intense. Although the film has an essentially happy ending, the tone is sad and repentant. <br /> <br /> Outstanding performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as always), and Robert Hardy as the notorious villain (most audiences probably recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involving her and Holmes are a fuss). I give a shit 1/2 1/2 *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough inspector Lestrade. (I wish they had added in the scene at the end of the story where he gives the description of the two thieves, one of which coincides with Watson).
