Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau started and ended their career together. Remember better as the Grumpiest of Old Men and the Oddest Couple that made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of the most beloved comedy teams in Hollywood of the last 100 years. Not as "obscene" as Pryor and Wilder, however, were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern routine of the Marx Brothers. Like the physical comedy and the mix of chaos for which Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous. In the strange pair, Lemmon and Matthau play the complete opposites that create chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually about themselves, as opposed to passing the joke on to another. It is not a typical movie of men, it is in a way an adult comedy with two old men as opposed to two young teenagers at their best. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is enough entertainment. Although this movie is not for everyone, this is a great comedy.
