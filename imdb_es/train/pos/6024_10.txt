I saw ZP when it was launched for the first time and I thought it was a big disappointment. His script seemed forced and arched and too fakey from the 60's. It's too direct and ridiculous politics. And let's be honest, I was still under a love spell known as BLOWUP: and I still have not shaken it completely. Now the "love" is twisted with all kinds of nostalgia that evokes and, well. . . Good luck for me! <br /> <br /> But the time is advancing and the time has been kind to ZP and time has been a master for me. I revisit this film every ten years and, with age, it improves and improves. And ZP is your own "experience" and is only really linked to BLOWUP through its creator, the great Mr. Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine image. Printed, projected in its correct size (immense), restored by a cultural agency of the Italian government that knows a good work of art when it sees it and knows the importance of maintaining such beauty in good shape. To this day I remember the panting of the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand volt visual shock that Antonioni had intentionally launched to awaken us to a new level of consciousness. And, in fact, what follows from that point is a completely different kind of "place". <br /> <br /> What surprises me is how this movie is becoming something of its own. <br /> <br /> I remember The second time I saw him, at the beginning of the 80s, I started to feel affection for the film in general and for Daria and Mark in particular. Whereas, before these two seemed like an intelligent and intelligent version of Olivia and Leonard de Zefferelli (read: Romeo and Juliet), they were now involving me, particularly La Chica in her insistent slo-motion-ality. She took her time. . . Live. Everything, EVERYTHING dies around him. <br /> <br /> By exciting the theater, the light of Reality quickly began to erase my new "enjoyment". The big 80s and quilted and padded shoulders whispered: "But that's a hippie fantasy: let it go." <br /> <br /> The strength of Antonioni's vision had, as I realized, had already been realized. developed inside me THE FIRST It was so I answered "80s" with a "Uh-Huh" and kept my "love" secret, possessive and jealous. <br /> <br /> But, this is what good art does within you and, if you wish, it has its way and "loves" you back: secretly, jealously and possessively. And they "change" you. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in their March lineup. Undoubtedly, ZP must be seen on a giant screen so you can really take it to your built environment. But, hey, sometimes, even seeing the Beloved in a picture of a newspaper is no better than not seeing it. <br /> <br /> Today, reality has mysteriously retreated and been replaced by complaints from the ALICE RESTAURANT. . <br /> <br /> Therefore, it is still too "difficult", too "disturbing", also "what"? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's that, like all good art, it lives while everything dies around it. <br /> <br /> Peace.
