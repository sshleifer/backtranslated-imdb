I guess, then, you've never heard of "Topper". <br /> <br /> that, in addition to the two stars that only one member of the cast could see, he had a dog, ditto. <br /> <br /> This was the kind of program I had "Not Gonna Make It", written from the first episode, it was like an arcade video game where you really have to read the instructions to play; Nobody (well, very few of us, apparently) wants to see a comedy show that has a basic premise that really requires that * thought * be understood.
