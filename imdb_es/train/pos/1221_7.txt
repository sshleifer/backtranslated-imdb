['For a long time, I liked this movie better than the original Care Bears movie. Well, last summer, I watched the two of them together and decided I was wrong. The first one is a better Care Bears movie (as you may have guessed if you read my review). This is not a BAD movie, it&#39;s just ... VERY STRANGE. <br /><br /> Well, first of all, as some people have mentioned, completely disapproves of any knowledge of the first movie. I can not think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly (especially with the genres of some characters and how they met). When I was little and seeing this, I was a little confused and anguished. I felt the same way seeing him as an adult! <br /><br /> Then, the reasons why the movie is quite good (IF the link to the first movie). I can not think of another movie for young children with a DEMON, since it is villan! Now I am not suggesting for a minute that the evil demons that want to steal the souls of the campers and Care Bears are good, it just seems great to have a BEING MISUNDELY IN THE SAME in a movie for young children! It&#39;s like that bizzare movie &quot;Santa Clause vs. Satan&quot; from Mexico that you listen to sometimes. <br /><br /> Anyway, the name of the demon is Darkheart and he wants this girl to help him get the Care Bears in exchange for granting him special powers. Very dark for a children&#39;s movie, huh? And did I mention that Darkheart appears to the girl more often as WHINEY VOICED 10 YEAR OLD BOY? Rare! Meanwhile, other children are in Care-a-Lot taking care of BABY CARE BEARS. Oh man! Demons and bears of the care of the baby IN THE SAME MOVIE! <br /><br /> Needless to say, everything is clarified at the end (but not before seeing Darkheart catch the souls of Care Bears in this fearsome spider scene in a [surprisingly] deeply disturbing scene). But I&#39;m left with the question of whether this film has found the cult audience it deserves so much. I could just see it again myself.']
