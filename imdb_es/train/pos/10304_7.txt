"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially the trailers. However, I found in him a deeper message that I really liked this movie more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and God gives him divine powers to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and although it is not his usual movie type or one of his best roles, he does it excellent with what he is given to work with. Although raw sometimes, the film has plenty of laughs, as Bruce split his soup in half as the Red Sea and the reactions of the customers before him, as well as the image of God, apparently calm and carefree Freeman. Sometimes it is too exaggerated, and there is some raw humor, but in general it manages to be something funny. There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who always helps. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tearing, and the message is clear, that we must do what God has called us to do and "be the miracle." The film is far from perfect, but it's still nice, and much better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film. <br /> <br /> *** of ** **
