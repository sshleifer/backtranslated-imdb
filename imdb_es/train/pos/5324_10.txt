Having seen this movie since 1998 showing the VH-1, I just had to comment. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie on television, it was around 1981, and I remember recording it. of my mother's betamax. He ended up recording in black and white for some reason, which gave him a vintage look that I liked. <br /> <br /> I remember very clearly the film that begins with the song, "My Bonnie", as the Panorama Camera on a scene from Liverpool. I also remember the opening scene where Paul makes a gesture to some girls and says: "Look, talent!" So it was with great irritation that I appeared in my 1998 recorded version and "remembered" that the movie starts with "She Loves You", instead of "My Bonnie". When you see the slowness of the camera with respect to the speed of the music, you can see that "She Loves You" simply does not fit. Also, in this "later" version when Paul sees the girls, he says: "Look, GIRLS!" ... and somehow remembering the previous version, that word did not seem to fit either. Why they felt that they had to Americanize this film for the American public, it surpasses me. Personally, if I'm going to see a movie about a British band, I want all the British colloquialisms, and that would be part of their speech, manners, etc. <br /> <br /> Another irritation was how the edition was "chopped" for television. Right after Stu is defeated, for example, the film cuts to a large number of commercial breaks. Yes, I know it depends on the network, but it really ruins the effect of a movie so that it is cut, as we all know. What some people may find insignificant in terms of dialogue (and, therefore, is fine to edit), can actually help explain a particular action or scene that follows. <br /> <br /> My point is, the "best" version of this movie was probably the previous version I recorded from 1981, which included the "Shake, Rattle & Roll" scene that my 1998 version did not included I started to assume that there had to be two different versions made for television, and a look at the "alternative versions" link regarding this movie showed me that I was right. The fact that the American version had some scenes and / or shorter / trimmed / different dialogues is a big disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if you care about those things. Imo, the best option is to try to get the European version of this movie, if possible, and (probably even less possible), an unedited version. Unfortunately, I had to discard my old European version of betamax because I did not know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I found that this film is, perhaps, one of the best films related to the History behind the "birth of the Beatles". Aware that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and TV when portraying events in history, I did not let any discrepancy spoil my enjoyment of the movie. Of course, you see that the Beatles play songs in the Cave that made me wonder: "Did they even write that at the time? I do not think so", but, nevertheless, I thought it was a great movie and the presentations, wonderful. <br /> <br /> The real highlight for me, in fact, was the actor who played John, Stephen MacKenna. I almost fell in love with him. His appearance, gestures, personality and spoken voice seemed to be accurate. He looked like a young John for me to do a double take towards the end of the movie when you see the Beatles performing in Ed Sullivan for the first time. In fact, I found myself questioning whether or not it was the real Beatle images, until I saw the other actors on the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an accurate and accurate history of the life and beginnings of The Beatles, you can not get any better than, "The Beatles' Anthology", as it was "written" by the boys , themselves. However, if you are looking for a funny snapshot of your days before the Beatlemania before your arrival in the United States and leave your anal anal evaluations at the door, you can not go wrong with the "Birth of the Beatles" - You must for any "real" or casual Beatle fan.
