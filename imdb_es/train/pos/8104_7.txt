This is an amazing film from 1936. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), the elegant vision of the year 2036 that comes after that makes up for it. However, do not plan to be able to understand the whole dialogue: the quality of the sound and the accents (it's American, but the American of the 1930s) make it difficult. <br /> <br /> Basically, history is an overwhelming story. 100 year look in a fictional city in the United States called "Everytown". It extends from 1936, when a war is on the horizon, until 2036, when technology advances and creates its own problems. <br /> <br /> The first hour is a bit slow, although it is difficult to say which audiences I would have thought back then. The events, the suspense and the images are quite discreet in today's terms. However, when it reaches the future, it is simply fun to watch. The big sets and the retro sci-fi look of everything is hard to beat. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a great listening ability, this movie is hard to listen to. I think I only understood 80% of the dialogue. I could use hidden subtitles. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of science fiction, this is one of the classics of the genre and you have to see it (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until there is a version of hidden subtitles and then watch it if you are comfortable with the movies of this period.
