I rented this movie because of my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat odd history of Mormons. This film tries to give an idea of ​​how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" into one of the main religions of the world. First, it focuses on the problems Mormons had in their settlement in Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. In the course of that test, Brigham Young rises to tell of his conversion to Mormonism and his belief in Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is killed, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts, he perseveres and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the righteousness of his leadership. Later, as the crickets destroy the crops, he again doubts that he has really been chosen; however, a miracle occurs, which consolidates its place in history. The story to be compelling and interesting. I would love to know if Mormons believe that this is an accurate representation. Polygamy is a part of history, but the reasons why this is fundamental for SUD are not mentioned. The theme is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> I am sure that people stay away from this film because of its religious theme, but it has a great cast and will keep its interest at all times.
