Taking a break from her escapist career in the early 1980s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker's "The Color Purple," about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Seeing Goldberg play Celie, it's amazing that this is the same woman who starred in films like "Sister Act". This is the kind of film that could easily be, no, make it SHOULD be, part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women's Studies. There is a scene that can be the most magnificent editing work that has been seen on the screen (you will know it when you see it). I can not believe that this did not win a single Oscar; It may be the second best Spielberg movie behind "Schindler's List" (maybe even related to it). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
