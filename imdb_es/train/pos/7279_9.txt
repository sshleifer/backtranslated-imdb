My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 years old (I've always liked horror movies) and I still enjoyed it. The atmosphere is amazing and the story original and entertaining. I especially love the scenes where the RV is under attack in the desert. The rocks are really convincing for such a low budget movie. The performance is above average for this type of movies and the music is strange. This is definitely a gem classified as a uder. I recommend it to anyone who likes these strange movies of the late seventies, early eighties like "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Hospital Massacre" and "Return of the Aliens , the Deadly "Desovar." Definitely a classic !!
