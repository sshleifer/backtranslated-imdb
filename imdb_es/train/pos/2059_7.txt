What a funny movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and the Scarecrow is different and original. It really brought me back to the monsters of the 80's. The budget is obviously low and not all are Pacino behind the lens, but it does not matter because he never takes it seriously. From the redneck garbage trailer to the Scarecrow flying martial arts movements, this is truly a movie gem. Take some refreshments, snacks and a couple of friends and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much that I went out and bought the 3 Scarecrow films. Of course, they are not for everyone but for everyone their own. Sometimes you just have to put the thought cap down and smile.
