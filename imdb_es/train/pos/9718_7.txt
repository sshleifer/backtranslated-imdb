POSSIBLE SPOILER - Somehow, "How to alienate friends ..." is the "loser learns to adapt, becomes successful and discovers that something else matters more" type of history, located in the celebrity business. - END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book but this comedy offers several good moments. Although I do believe that the end is defective. He felt too fast and too abrupt, as if something was missing. Also, I would say that the film is not able to maintain a high level. Apart from this, you will find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities. So far I have never seen Pegg differently. Still, it is a very unique type, although on the screen it can sometimes seem a bit more tedious than necessary. Fox showed that he is capable of playing a hot star with his head in the clouds. I do not know if it was something difficult to do, but his performance was excellent and much better than during "Transformers" (well ... probably not a difficult competition). Kirsten Dunst is a lot of Kirsten Dunst (again) and you may like it (like me) or that you find annoying. On the other hand, you will see Anderson, who showed his ability to act, and Jeff Bridges (who is fine, but perhaps could have acted a little more powerful). They all fit well with your character. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a good celebrity comedy with some more and less funny passages, a sweet cast but too sudden an ending.
