While the "special effects" and technical attributes of this film may be ridiculous to some, I was never able to erase the images that this film recorded in my young and impressionable mind when I first saw it around 8 years of age. The story of this girl's survival and the tests she endured have stayed with me all these years, and I have remembered on more than one occasion how the girl managed to get out of situations far beyond what I have seen. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a true story, and the fact that I was only a child when I saw it for the first time, may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie. Every time this film was broadcast on television in the 70s and 80s, I was fascinated with television and drank each scene with an interest I can not explain. I suppose that seeing this for the first time as an adult (and with a jaded world view) may not be so pleasant for some. In fact, I tried hard to get a copy so I could show this movie to my son. <br /> <br /> This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you are impressed by the remarkable stories of human survival, it is partial to Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or the Amazon, then I think you could enjoy this movie as much as I have been enjoying it for the past 30 years.
