I never really knew who Robert Wuhl was before I saw this. But after seeing it I realized how much fun it is. This HBO special presents him teaching "American history" to film students at the University of New York and the man was simply phenomenal. He made fun of almost all the key historical events that occurred not only in the US. UU But in other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me question whether what I accept as the true infallible story is really true. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed how Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information with a great comedy and I learned a lot more exciting. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the story and is willing to question what their beliefs are.
