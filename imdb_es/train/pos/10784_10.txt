['Although not throughout the film, Andy Griffith again plays his best role in this CBS television movie. The plot is easy: the character of Griffith dies and his last wish is that his wife and children scatter their ashes in the place he named (Mountains Somewhere). Although you will never see it on TV or be published on video, if you have the opportunity to watch it, TAKE IT.']
