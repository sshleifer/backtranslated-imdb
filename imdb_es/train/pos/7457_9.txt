This is one of the best bonus games I've played because: <br /> <br /> Missions are fun to play, have a lot of action and can be very difficult at times, which makes it even more fun. The weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are really good, the driving missions are fun to do. This James Bond game has a good story. The voice over the actors in this game is really good and it's great that Pierce Brosnan is in this game and the appearance of the characters is really good because they look like they look in real life, which is really cool. Also the graphics in this game are pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********* of **********
