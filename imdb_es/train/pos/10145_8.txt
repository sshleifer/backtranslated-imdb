This is a very old and charming movie. The locations are excellent and the situation is one of those old Preston Sturgess movies. If you want to see a movie that does not require much more than sitting down and relaxing, here it is. The acting is good, and I really liked Michael Rispoli. I was also in Rounders. And while you were sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun. It is just what happens when two people who are about to get married find that they really love the weekend they are planning their own weddings. I know ... it sounds weird ... but it is. And that's what makes it fun to watch. It will make your girlfriend embrace you or abandon you, but at least you will know.
