['It&#39;s a great movie. I think some people think that this might not be based on a true story. No matter this, the movie is great, and all you can think about is not why a balloon with a siren ends up flying in the city of sirens and so on, instead of thinking that &quot;a girl&#39;s wish came true &quot;, and this means that all of our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in ourselves and do everything possible in this world to make them come true. The girl (Desi, in the movie) and her mother were the best actors I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Good for them, for all the actors, all for the director. If someone can tell you this, please tell them: &quot;A 25 year old Romanian guy says thank you for making this movie.&quot;']
