I will be honest. I got this movie to be able to make fun of her. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Living Dead"? What other reaction could it have? The thing is that, however, the film (and its creators) decided that it was not going to make fun. Instead, I was going to do everything possible to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? He approached terribly. A little less cheese in the incidental music, a little more professionalism in photography, acting, the unforeseen (like the accessories, I love the Best Buy bag) ... well, it's not a classic of the film genre of zombies, but it's still a pretty pretty little movie by itself. And the acting, writing and rhythm are surprisingly better than I would have expected. There's even some decent humor, as two of our leaders debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you can overlook the low budget (which leaves its mark on everything, unfortunately) and the almost constant blasphemy, this can be a very fun time at the cinema. No, it's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the creators, the actors, the team, all tried to make a good movie (instead of a classic camp) and that counts a lot. The line of zombie campaign movies is a mile long, and thanks, guys, for not adding more. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the Quiroz brothers. I'd love to see what they do next. And hey, someone, give them a budget!
