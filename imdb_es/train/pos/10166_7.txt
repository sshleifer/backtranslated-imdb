['I observed it on an 8 hour flight and (presumably due to pressure and altitude) I actually found it somewhat entertaining (emphasis on &quot;soft&quot;). <br /><br /> The real idea behind the film was brilliant: a woman dies, her boyfriend falls in love with another person, decided to make sure they do not get together, but in the end she allows them to do it. Unfortunately the movie itself was not so good. Okay, there was some laughter and all the actors worked well. But from the beginning, the plot was as predictable as the fate of the flight he was traveling on. I think the whole part of the story of a gay friend but not gay could have been much better. The parrot I was talking about was a good idea but, to be honest, it was not really fun. <br /><br /> In short, the movie was more interesting than looking at the seat in front of me, but it was a close decision.']
