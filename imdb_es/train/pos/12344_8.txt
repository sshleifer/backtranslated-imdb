The Sea Is Watching has been made from an original script by Akira Kurosawa, and in fact is a lush and warm film. Seeing it will be a pleasure! <br /> <br /> Kei Kumai, as a director, certainly is not equal to the old but eternal master (particularly the mass scenes at the beginning of the film has a terrible performance), but the general mood and landscape it is really nice. Another thing that is missed here: Kurosawa always managed to let the characters go much more than what they are really showing and doing. <br /> <br /> That was probably his magic on set while filming; and maybe this script was not completely up to par yet. <br /> <br /> Maybe we just miss the teacher's eye. <br /> <br /> This is a lovely and sweet movie, but it's not Kurosawa Wait that could be very silly ...
