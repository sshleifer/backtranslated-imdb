<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. However, recorded in my memory to never leave me is a scene in which Mickey Rooney, "Killer Mears" knows that he must be executed and is approaching the moment of truth. Dance, cry and laugh. He hesitates from hesteria to euphoria and executes the tactics of emotion. I have never seen such a brilliant performance of a living or dead actor, past or present. It was then that I know with certainty that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is an actor of great genius. However I kept it, my opinion for me for years thinking, surely I should be alone in this point of view. Approximately 15 years after watching this film for the last time on television, I had the opportunity to read the old Los Angeles Times question and answer section. The question was posed to Lawrence Olivier, and the question was: "Mr. Olivier, you are considered one of the best actors of all time, who do you consider to be among the best actors?" His response was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was surprised, but it did not surprise me. I immediately returned to his "Killer Mears" and I felt very good for having seen this great skill in him, and now having my opinion backed by another job that I admired ... Later, of course, there was "Bill" and many others big. Moments with Mikey Rooney. This movie, "The Last Mile" must be seen by all the acting students. Frankly I do not remember much about the movie after all these years, but Mr. Rooney in it will never leave me. If someone out there remembers this movie like me? I would be interested to hear from you. For this image recorded only in my heart I gave him a 10 just in the face of his performance.
