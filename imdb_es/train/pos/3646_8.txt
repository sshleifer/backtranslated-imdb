"The Rookie" by Walt Disney is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league player who made one of the most amazing comebacks in the history of the sport, ending a retirement of almost 10 years and debuting in the big leagues in 1999 at the age of 35. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief synopsis of Morris's childhood, which included a series of relocations: his father was a military man. And even when his family settled for football in crazed Texas, Morris' passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> <br /> The childhood segment then advances some 23 years to adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid), who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life he was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he tried a career as a baseball player but that did not work. <br /> <br /> Morris's team is struggling and giving them a lecture on how to give up their dreams. They turn the table around and tell him he should try for a Major League team. On several occasions when he throws them into practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he throws. Morris is not convinced, but accepts an agreement with his players in which, if they win the district, he will try for a major league team. <br /> <br /> Big Lake wins the district and, adhering to his end of the deal, Morris attends a test of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles per hour, faster than he pitched during his minor league career and outstanding speed even for a Major League pitcher. After another test with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> This leaves you with a difficult decision: stay in your comfortable life or once again pursue your Major League dream by going through the minor league routine of earning little money and spending months at a time. time away from home And the decision is even more agonizing than during his first season in the minor leagues because he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris signs with the Devil Rays, starts at the AA level and quickly climbs to AAA Level, one level below Major League Baseball. But as the season ends, the chances of being "called" become increasingly scarce. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I love this movie. There are many great presentations and nice characters, and it's easy to find yourself really attracted to Morris. In addition, the film does a great job portraying professional baseball at the major and minor league levels. And, above all, it teaches the timeless message of holding on to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie has some flaws. Although generally accurate, it exaggerates and even manufactures some things. Take a look at http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html to see some examples. In addition, except for a scene in which he prays with his players, the film completely ignores Morris's Christian faith. But considering the zeal of Disney's left wing, that's not surprising. <br /> <br /> Presumably, many exaggerations / fabrications were made to make the story more dramatic. However, the 20-minute documentary on Morris included in the DVD presents information that makes his story more dramatic, but is excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> For example, from his birth until his family settled in Texas forever. When he was 12 years old, Morris relocated 14 times. And his early career in the minor leagues ended after four surgeries through which he lost half the muscle in his left shoulder (throwing), making his 98 mph throw even more unexplainable. <br /> <br /> To fully appreciate and understand the In the Jim Morris story, it is good to not only watch "The Rookie" but also watch the DVD documentary, review the link mentioned above about the inaccuracies of the film and probably also read the biography of Morris, also titled "The Rookie". I have not read the book, but I hope to read one of these days. <br /> <br /> But in general, "The Rookie" is a very good portrait of a miraculous story and is a powerful testimony to the power of dreams. And the triumph of the common man. 8/10
