Upon seeing it for the first time, I found that this story was at least less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales. After many more, I think it is one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty bad, especially the love song, but they highlight two things that make the film, even the song, worthwhile. One is the art direction. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales, this is a beautifully decorated period piece; Each piece of cloth and jewel (which have important parts in the plot of this film) look fresh and new, and contrast with the simple clothes of the peasants. Even during the love song I find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess, beautifully done. The other thing is the comic timing. Much of the movie is corny, but the emperor's vanity (and his mockery of him at the end), the suspicious guard, the guard chasing Nicholas and the stupid prince, were all pretty funny and seemed ridiculous on purpose. . And the sequence during the song Weave-O compensates for the songs that were not so good.
