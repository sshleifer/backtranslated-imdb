Not many comments, therefore I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO FOR OTHER OPINIONS! This was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can really put together a good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay gave another example of excellent acting, like bhoomika, which was a bit unexpected, but great to watch. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there has not been much publicity surrounding the launch. <br /> <br /> Or filmfare / other awards nominations, considering how good the film was. <br /> <br /> Better than Khakee, I thought, and I thought Khakkee was also a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty long movie, but it's definitely worth it and while I watch it, it definitely seems long. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next RKS movie and the next AB movie, Akshay that always seem to go well together ... for example waqt. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika has also performed very well in the film and should do very well if it continues in the same way in the future.
