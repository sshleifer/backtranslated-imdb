James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. When one reads "Liberation", one is transported instantly to the lush wooded areas of the deep south. When one sees the film version of John Boorman's book, one realizes the precision with which he captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narrative. The characters are fully realized, and the representations are fantastic. The first time I saw this movie was in 1992, after my first year of university. I was in a phase where I was watching films that premiered a few years after my birth in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon" and "All the President's Men"; Beautiful movies, all of them. This was easily the class of the group. That says a lot.
