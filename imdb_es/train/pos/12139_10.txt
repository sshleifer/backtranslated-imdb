This film, although it is more than 70 years old, is still a very moving and strong film. Bette Davis, as the vicious and vicious Cockney waitress, Mildred, is absolutely credible. Seeing his performance is still fascinating. She makes the spectator absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time. The performance of Leslie Howard as the weak and obsessed Phillip Carey is not as strong, but I do not see how any actor can defend against the performance of Mrs. Davis. She chews the stage in every scene she is in, stealing the show completely. This is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the Academy Award, but she lost. It was shocking for her day, with issues of unmarried pregnancies, multiple sexual partners and Mildred's vicious language, so it's somewhat antiquated, but it's still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene in which Mildred tells Phillip what he REALLY thinks of him ("You, cad, dirty pig ...") is still one of the best performances I've seen in the movie.
