['As far as I can remember, Balanchine&#39;s alterations to the Tchaikovsky score are the following: <br /><br /> 1) The final section of Grossvatertanz (a traditional melody that is played at the end of a party) is repeated several times to give the children one last dance before the end of their scene. <br /><br /> 2) A violin solo, written for but removed from the Tchaikovsky score for The Sleeping Beauty, is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship with music for the growing Christmas tree that occurs soon after. <br /><br /> 3) The only one is eliminated for the gentleman of Sugar Plum Fairy. <br /><br /> It seems to me that the accusation that Balanchine has somehow profaned Tchaikovsky&#39;s high score is out of place.']
