Why do people complain about this movie and not about horrible movies like The Godfather? Titanic is the best film of the 21st century. With a great performance, direction, effects, music and, in general, everything. This movie is always abandoned by everyone, because one day someone said he did not like it anymore and most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie is not only the most awarded film with an Oscar of all time, but the most won and, unfortunately, one of the most underestimated films I've seen. Apart from that, it's really the best movie of all time. The only films that come close to being like all star wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything from masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors, but none of them match James Cameron's masterpiece TITANIC.
