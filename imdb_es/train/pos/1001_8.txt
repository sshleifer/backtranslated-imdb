A somewhat fun, good-paced action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as a miserable, fast-talking guy chosen by a US Treasury agent (David Morse) too demanding to be launched on the streets of New York to find a Delicate computer hacker / hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead. <br /> <br /> "Bait" marks the second-year feature for Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") and he handles the task quite well even though he does not get over his first movie. What the two movies have in common are the action sequences, which are absolutely excellent. <br /> <br /> Foxx is pretty good here, although his character is annoying at first, but throughout the movie I started capturing in. Hutchinson is wonderful as the brain that can be ruthless as John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier in "Marathon Man". Morse is fine as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all costs.
