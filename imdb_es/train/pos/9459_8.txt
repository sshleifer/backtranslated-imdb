['I watch the romantic comedies with some hesitation, because the comedies present old cliches that make a film not interesting. Typically, in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and there is a boy, both fall in love, then they have problems and then they win the problems to get married or whatever. But, this movie is a different story, it&#39;s really very different from the romantic comedies I&#39;ve seen lately. <br /><br /> There is a widower guy (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookstore and speaks for some time, after Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this something starts to become significant, we get a turn. Marie is her brother&#39;s girlfriend. Regardless of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but his love would not only be possible. How the rest of the story becomes possible. <br /><br /> Steve Carell performs well, Juliette Binoche is as good as Marie. And everything else is done well. It&#39;s a good movie, look at it.']
