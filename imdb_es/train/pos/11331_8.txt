Normally I am not obliged to write a review for a film, but the only comment for this film so far is quite unfair, so I feel it is necessary to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" (or as it was titled in the theater, I saw it, "Fallen") follows Matiss, a lonely Latvian archivist, while trying to learn about a woman he did not try to avoid jump off a bridge, as well as His reasons for doing so. That's the plot in a few words, but this film does not care about the story, but the representation of the guilt of a man who did not act. As a detective who investigates the incident tells us, we generally do not care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until they die. <br /> <br /> The comparisons with Michaelango Antonioni and his "Blowup" will be the most important. They are likely to abound in any comments you have read about "Krisana". The influence of Antonioni's philosophical and austere style and the story of "Blowup" are clear and, in fact, the writer / director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which Matiss tries to meet the woman who jumped from the stage. Bridge, or at least what he thinks he did. <br /> <br /> The only other person who shares their views on the film distorts the look and sound of the "university film class". He or she does not consider the budgetary constraints that are most likely to be faced by a Latvian existentialist film, but atmospheric black-and-white cinematography and ambient sound succeed on an artistic level to represent Matiss's loneliness. The background sound of the wind and the noises of the street give it a sinister aura and reminds us of a Fellini movie, whether that was Kelemen's intention. The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money, but this restriction is used to the advantage of the film. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" is successful as a study of characters with enough humor to avoid being too selfish. It could easily have fallen into the traps of a mystery story, but avoid that and it becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt. If you are more concerned about the plot, this film and its ending can frustrate you. Otherwise, take the time to be occupied by him. It's worth looking for.
