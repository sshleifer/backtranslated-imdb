Roman Polanski is considered one of the most important directors of our time, as the mind behind the classics such as "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown". Probably, what makes Polanski's films very interesting is the fact that while he is able to create commercially attractive films like the masterpieces mentioned above, he also likes to make discrete films that are of a more personal nature. "Le Locataire", or "The Tenant", is one of those films; A horror / suspense story about paranoia and the obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror films ever made. <br /> <br /> Polanski plays Telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds one, he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant, Simone Choule, tried to commit suicide by jumping out the window. After Simone dies because of the injuries, Trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her, to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building. <br /> <br /> Sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other "apartment themed" movies ("Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby"), this film focuses on the odd conspiracy that may or may not be completely in the Trelkovsky's head, the catastrophic effects that paranoia has on his mind and the strange obsession he has done with the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky's descent into darkness is perfectly represented by Polanski. his performance seems strange and wooden, little by little one discovers that Polanski acts in that way because Trelkovsky must be acted in that way, like an almost lifeless simpleton, who gets caught up in this maddening sub-world that is inhabited by a collection of strangers, the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters, they are very important for the success of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, the beautiful c Polanski's inematography in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as a cage for Trelkovsky. . The disturbing images that Polanski uses to convey the sensation of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them frightening and attractive. <br /> <br /> If a flaw is found in the movie, it's definitely a bit slow at first This may sound like a detour, but in fact, the slow rhythm of the beginning works perfectly, as it imitates the boring Trelkovsky's life and how he gradually enters a different realm. In addition, the complicated plot is definitely not easy to understand due to the many complex layers it has. However, more than a defect, it is a joy to face a provocative plot of thoughts like this. <br /> <br /> While "The tenant" may not be for everyone, those interested in psychological horror and surrealist story lines. You will be pleased by the experience. "Le Locataire" is really one of Roman Polanksi's masterpieces. 10/10
