['Arthur Bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a billionaire and is attracted to people &quot;below him&quot; in social status: he pays for a prostitute in the initial scenes and then feels greatly attracted to a thief. <br /><br /> He also drinks a lot, and sometimes he is driving while he drinks, which of course is not fun, ever. <br /><br /> The movie is great, but behind the comedy there is also some reality. John Gielgud cleans the floor with everyone else on the screen and created a character for all ages. Talk about deserving an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but your Gielgud as &quot;Hobson&quot; will remember it more.']
