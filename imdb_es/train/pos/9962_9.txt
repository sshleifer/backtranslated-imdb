I was a little afraid of watching this movie because of its fees. But living in Italy titles like this have never been seen and I love it so much that I decided to try it. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance movie I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just "winning." It is moving and well written and well directed. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, is so mature and focused and AWARE of her TALENT (and the talent Rutina Wesley has, my mouth open in the final dance scene). The way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is, honestly, inspiring. Also, the fact that she is not the typical super sexy girl (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her really attractive and real. Seriously, why is this movie so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it is a good job. Really good, actually. I even cried at the end of the movie. And the dance routines are sick.
