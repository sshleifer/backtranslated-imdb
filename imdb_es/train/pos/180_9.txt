['When Gundam0079 became the trilogy of the movie that most of us are familiar with, much of it was pure action and less than anything else. This OVA is a bit the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not full of action, but of emotional things. The two main action sequences in this, I think, are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many series of gundam, movies and OVA, I was completely ready for a civil-esquire film. This movie did a fantastic job of that. What makes this film stand out is that it shows that both sides of the war have good and bad people. It made the Zeons seem more human instead of the original films, where they are described as the second appearance of the evil Nazis. Most people who do not like the anime that I forced myself to watch this movie (lol), they liked it. Therefore, I would recommend it to many people only because of the history against the war. If you are a Gundam fan and have not seen this, you should not be reading this; You should be looking at it now.']
