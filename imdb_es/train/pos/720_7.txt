['Imagine how the school would have been in a world like this: children are a great gang that has very good musical taste and they unite against bad directors and teachers. &quot;Rock &#39;N&#39; Roll High School&quot; takes place in that world. It&#39;s like a Ramones album that comes alive. All the characters are as silly, innocent and charming as the Ramones&#39; songs, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. The high school comedies have really changed over the years, if you compare a movie like &quot;American Pie&quot; with this classic of the late 70&#39;s, where sexual jokes are not made without flavor. Since it is apparently working on a new version, it is likely that the charm of the original will be lost on the way and be replaced by vulgar, half-fun jokes, as Bill Hicks called them. However, the main problem will be that the Ramones CAN NOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this movie and nobody else could come close to taking their place. Therefore, it would be best to leave the original alone, however peculiar and charming it may be. Gabba Gabba Hey!']
