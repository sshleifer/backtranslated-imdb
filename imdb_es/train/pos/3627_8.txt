What a fun experience! I was expecting a sappy children's movie and I discovered that I enjoyed it more than when I was a teenager. Take a handkerchief, it's not sad, it just 'moves' in parts. Finally, it is a "feel good" movie for the whole family. Note: they are more than 2 hours, so consider leaving the home of the smallest 'squirmers' for this. AP
