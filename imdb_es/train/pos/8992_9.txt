A really great movie. A must see for any music snob. You really do not have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie. Before the movie, I only listened to two songs by Dandy Warhols. All that is required is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film centers around the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The Dandy Warhols have a role in the film, as the "rival band", but they are the second violin of BJM. The Dandy Warhols do not play as important a role in the film as I originally thought, but, again, they did not have the element of emotion and unpredictability of BJM. You can not stop being fascinated by the band. and his very charismatic front, Anton Newcombe. By itself, it is a film and an insightful studio in the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy.
