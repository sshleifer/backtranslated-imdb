From the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work (RICHARD WIDMARK) stealing a woman's purse (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is relentlessly fascinating to watch. In part it's because the performance is uniformly strong throughout the cast, the black and white photography is sharp and adds to the harshness of the story and the characters, and because the direction of Samuel Fuller places him in the same league as the great as John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, it has the same urgency as Huston's film about a robbery that goes wrong, but the reward is not so strong. <br /> <br /> JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard-edged girl that Widmark describes as being "beaten around a lot". She gives a lot of energy and sex appeal to her role as the not too bright woman who carries a micro-film in her purse for her boyfriend (RICHARD KILEY), something the FBI already knows. They are in their way when the theft occurs. <br /> <br /> THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman named "Moe" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying with it. lifetime. She is particularly moving in her final scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This is guaranteed to keep your attention through its execution time of one hour and twenty minutes. Good news from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
