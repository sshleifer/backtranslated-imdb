John Water ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It gives the viewer a surreal image of life in Baltimore (I live in the vicinity of Washington, DC), with a use of color similar to Warhol, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker becomes bigger than his city can handle, and is separated from his loved ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his art director who loves men. The image left a refreshing taste in my mouth, like strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day, and although this taste was quite flat and simplistic, it only made everything deeper and more critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to bear arms ... and everything else that this country represents. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
