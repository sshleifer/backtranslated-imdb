One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I've seen anything like this in a long time on the network or on cable television. Watching this program was like breathing fresh air in the middle of a television show full of reality shows and boring repetitions. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I had my reservations. After all, critics were almost unanimous in criticizing and degrading the show. But when he finished half an hour (by the way, thank you, NBC, for running a commercial-free program), I was left with the feeling of instant love, love at first sight, the true love you feel in your gut. . Everything about this show shouted EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> The graphics in this show were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek. It is not a small feat considering that those films took years to develop. <br /> <br /> The cast was wonderful. I'm partial to John Goodman's voice, but the rest of the team certainly was on par with John. Special mention: the appearance of Lisa Kudrow. She was at the top of the game creating a neurotic, plump and lovable panda with a Jewish streak in it. (Panda from Brooklyn? Only in this program). <br /> <br /> The script was fun, with lots of internal and adult jokes that were sharp, but not sticky. A note for all parents: this is NOT for children. This program was never announced as such, and there is a reason why it is scheduled for 9PM, not at 8PM. Then, if you want to complain about the "objectionable context," keep your breath. Adults deserve a comedy made just for them, and the Father of Pride is. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a little surprised by Siegfried and Roy's characters. Do I perceive the "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are extravagant. Yes, they speak with a German accent. But that's the news of yesterday. Give us something new, something cool, something fun. Putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this program wanted to use the "star power" that these guys have. That is good for me. But, please, do not stop at something that everyone already knows by heart. With luck, the rest of the program will not play the same disc again and again. <br /> <br /> In general, the program is, without a doubt, a must-see program. Funny, witty, with some unexpected twists here and there, there has not been such a good comedy since Seinfeld. I'm certainly waiting for the next episode.
