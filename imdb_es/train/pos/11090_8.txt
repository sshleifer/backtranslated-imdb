The successful married businessman Harry Mitchell (an extraordinarily steely performance by Roy Scheider) has an adulterous adventure with the young and sexy stripper Cini (the beautiful Kelly Preston). Harry is blackmailed by a trio of poor-quality hoods: the moody director of porn theater Raimy (a splendidly slimy John Glover), the owner of the Leo club band (well played by Robert Trebor) and the crazy pimp Bobby Shy (a terribly intense Clarence Williams III) - who have videotaped his adventure with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, the hoods kill Cini and make it look like Harry did. This, in turn, ignites a dangerous battle of wit and will between Harry and the hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, who adopts a robust script based on Elmore Leonard's crime thriller and crime novel, maintains an agile and constant rhythm, provides a lot of tension and creates a super-sordid atmosphere. All the leaders are uniformly excellent, with outstanding turns of support by Ann-Margret as Harry's bitter and careless wife, Vanity as the tired prostitute Doreen, and Lonny Chapman as Jim O'Boyle's loyal business partner. The closed and uncomplicated plot keeps the audience on alert. The perversely profane dialogue, the brilliant cinematography of Jost Vacano, Gary Chang's touching score, the harshly amoral tone and the enthusiastic conclusion are also related to money. As an added benefit, both Vanity and Preston take off their clothes. A very strong and satisfying number that is worth checking out.
