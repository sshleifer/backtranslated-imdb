What a delicious romp? a film made with a lot of competition that has so much charm and a sensational factor that it lacks many romantic comedies. Einstein is played brilliantly by Walter Matthau, while Catherine by Meg Ryan is unforgettable. Better than I've seen it in those movies versus Tom Hanks? like the young mathematician who struggles to be recognized. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and feel sympathy for her immediately, and as a young man it is easy to understand what must have gone through Ed's mind (Tim Robbins) in the search for his true love. There is universal appeal in these emotions, even if I.Q. It keeps everything light, fun and well tied. <br /> <br /> Sure it's not heavy, but if you look there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, however, he was a great spiritualist; his sayings like something like "If it's not impossible, why do it?" He suggests that he is a believer in the fulfillment of higher goals beyond the immediate understanding of one. In this movie, there are questions about what an accident really is. for example, if the intervention of Albert and his extravagant cronies to move Catherine away from James without love (Stephen Fry, who gives life to this cardboard character and you can not help but feel his lack of feeling) counts. How much intervention occurs in our lives that we do not see, and is presented as something fortuitous? <br /> <br /> And, of course, we'd like to think about real life, despite what we often see from people we know, that we, Edwards, the Catherines and James have to learn to thaw the ice water in his veins. How nice to know that it could work in the fantasy land of the innocent (and disturbing, exclusively Caucasian) Eisenhower era of I.Q.
