If you would like to see a different kind of movie, if you feel the Love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie makes you think. Even though Georges has a mental disability, you can see the final intelligence at the end, when love gives you directions, not the brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel human. The movie is as good as Forrest Gump in my opinion. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there is not enough publicity to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" (The color of God) by Majid Majidi is another example of this type of foreign films, almost with a similar taste.
