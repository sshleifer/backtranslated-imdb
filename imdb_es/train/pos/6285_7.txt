What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer, he is expected to be full of action. <br /> <br /> In Bruckheimer's latest film, Gone in 60 Seconds, it's all about the nomenclature. With names of characters like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and idealized cars with names like Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it's just the continuous action that prevents you from just playing the name game. <br /> <br /> It's not a deep script in any way, but it's a great vehicle for action, as Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, comes out of the stolen car recall to save the life of his brother stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A new version of the cult hit of 1974, this film may not be intended for the same cult status, but it is entertaining. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you watching the performance. Although they are loaded with stars, none of them has outstanding performances, including a very weak performance by one of my favorites, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, after her recent victory at the Oscar, is just a show of love interest with hardly any screen time. <br /> <br /> Can a series of beautiful cars and the chases in which they get involved make a great movie? I think so. It is a pleasure to watch the film and, although a particular scene leads to the world of disbelief, the action is uninterrupted and the suspense is convincing. Be careful with other drivers struggling for pole position when leaving the cinema. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
