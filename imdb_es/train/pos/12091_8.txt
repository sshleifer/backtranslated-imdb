'Castle of Blood' (also known as 'Castle of Terror') is a well-crafted and surprisingly spooky entry by Italian director Anthony Dawson. The exquisite cinematography in black and white, the impeccable dubbing, the excellent casting, the quite logical scripts, the deliberate rhythm and a surprising ending (although totally appropriate) distinguish it. Only the movies are sometimes joke music and the brusque "love at first sight" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) is presented as an entertaining and entertaining film. <br /> <br /> While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub and tells one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers Alan to bet 100 pounds he can not survive tonight at Blackwood Castle, a night after Halloween when the dead walk. Alan can not afford the bet, so he bets his life for a £ 10 bet. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Black Sunday" ("The Mask of Satan") by Mario Bava, the "Castle of Blood" is quite moderate, which makes the few moments of violence even more terrible , especially surprising of a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space films of the 60s. <br /> <br /> It's a shame the only version of this film I've seen. The scan and scan version is badly damaged (and recorded). Even so, it's worth seeing, and he cries out for a new modern version, maybe with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a movie that compares well with "The Haunting" by Robert Wise.
