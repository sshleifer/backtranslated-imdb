This movie is very funny, and it has a great compilation of actors like William H. Macy, who have always played this type of role, perhaps its most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney, who is a very good actor who shows his work as a comedian in the Cohen brothers' film "Oh brother, where are you?" What turns out to be one of my favorite movies! But it has been difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood," here in Mexico. My city lacks good places to buy some good movies. I tried to buy it in Blockbuster but they do not know it by its original name, so maybe it's a bit easier to find if I have the name they gave it in Mexico, does anyone know?, Because I can not remember Cheers. TO.
