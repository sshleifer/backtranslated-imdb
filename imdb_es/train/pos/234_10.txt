I have always known that Anne DeSalvo was a great character actress, now I know she is also a great writer and director. I have been a fan since I first saw her in the movies "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". <br /> <br /> It's very rare to see Lee Grant these days in something. She has been missing from the screen for too long. It's also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a sit-com. This is his best work since "The Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an American Italian family, you will love this movie. I did not expect much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you have the opportunity, look at it.
