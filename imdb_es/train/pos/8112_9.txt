['The geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells create this extraordinary film of anticipation, with an ambition and a scope difficult to find today. They predict the Second World War and the way in which Britain was attacked, and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. They change the time; In the film, war and space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it is incredible. We even see a helicopter (the movie is older than them). <br /><br /> Unforgettable giant aircraft and a futuristic meritocracy of Roman-looking scientists with bubble helmets: if you can see through those funny costumes, you can appreciate the state of the artistic architecture of the masters of the 30s, Well&#39;s vision of a society rationalist, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and John Cabal as the archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being, who chooses to mold reality and not be molded by it. <br /><br /> 9 1/2 of 10. Inspiring like that final monologue by John Cabal.']
