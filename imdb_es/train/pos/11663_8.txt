The Secret of Kells is an independent and animated feature that gives us one of the legendary stories surrounding the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript of the Middle Ages that presents the four gospels of the New Testament. I did not know that this book really exists, but knowing now makes my interpretation and analysis much easier. There are some stories and ideas floating around about how the book came about, who wrote it and how it has survived for more than 1,000 years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to Brendan, an orphan who lives in the Abbey of Kells in Ireland with his uncle, Abbot Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson). Abbot Cellach is building a huge wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks. Brendan is not fond of the wall and not the other monks either. They are more focused on reading and writing, something for which Abbot Cellach no longer has time. He fears the "men of the north," those who plunder and leave cities and towns empty and burned. <br /> <br /> One day a traveler comes from the island of Iona, near Scotland. It is Brother Aidan, a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished. Abbot Cellach gives him permission to stay and Brendan meets with him. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. First you need ink for the book, but it requires specific berries. The only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest, an area outside of Brendan's boundaries. Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue his work, he decides to sneak away and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence. <br /> <br /> In the forest, Brendan meets Ashley, the protector of the forest. She allows Brendan to pass into the berries and on the way resembles her company. She warns him of the danger that looms in the darkness and of not being frustrated with him. There are worse things than the Vikings. From there, Brendan faces more challenges with the book and the imminent certainty of the invasion. <br /> <br /> I like history a lot more now that I know what it is about. Knowing now what the Book of Kells is and what it contains, animation makes a lot of sense. I'm sure you've seen photos or copies of ancient texts from hundreds of years ago, with ruffled borders, colorful images and extravagant patterns, creatures and writings that adorn the pages. Like the first Disney frames The Sword in the Stone. The animation here contains many similar designs and patterns. Create a unique visual experience in which history and animation almost try to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> I could not look away from the incredible details. This is one of the best 2D animations I've seen in years. It is vibrant, stimulating and full of life. The characters are constantly surrounded by designs, scribbles and patterns on the trees, on the walls and in the air simply floating around. Improve the movie <br /> <br /> The story is satisfactory, although I think the ending could have lasted a little longer. With an execution time of only 75 minutes, I think there could be something special in the final act. It does not give much information or allude to the importance of the book. We are reminded of its importance but we never understand it at all. We are told that it gives hope, but never why or how. That was really the only missing part of the movie. Otherwise, I thought the story was interesting, although it was surpassed by animation. <br /> <br /> I guess that up to a point it's fine. The animation can carry a movie so far before it falls short. History lacks some parts, but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history. I would recommend briefly consulting the Book of Kells just to get an idea of ​​what I and this film are talking about. I think it will help your visual experience much more. This is a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that definitely should not be missed.
