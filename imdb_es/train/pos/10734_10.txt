WOOHOO! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is the best testimony of what happened on September 11, 2001 in New York, compared to what the mainstream media shows. <br /> <br /> Those Exits can only show you what happened outside. This movie shows you what happened in the INTERIOR. <br /> <br /> Start with a focus on a rookie firefighter from New York, waiting for weeks for the first big fire that will be called to fight. The subject turns abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING PIECES OF THE FIRST PLANE to Hit the towers. You are then given a front row seat while the firefighters rush to the scene, in the lobby of Tower One. <br /> <br /> In the minutes preceding the crash of the second plane, and the subsequent fall of Tower Two, firefighters are seen reacting to the disturbing sound of people landing on the lobby. It is a show that you will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> It is heartbreaking, heartbreaking, and very convincing from the first minute to the last, the "9/11" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
