This is a pleasant surprise. A nice little story about the search for heroin, a very surprising metamorphosis of the priety of four eyes, which will soon be a kind of spinster in a rude queen of the DD cup sex. <br /> <br /> Visually a show for sore eyes, not only for two impressive actresses, but also for (most of) the costumes and makeup of the actors. An unnecessary part of the cheap came in a ridiculous imitation of the castle. <br /> <br /> Back to the positive: the film is spiced up with some unusually explicit camera shots that you would not expect in a soft core. I loved that scene with the icicles, the absolute potential of the classics. A small inconvenience only for (very) few strange scenes where the poor performance of the minor releases briefly suspended the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> 9/10 which includes an additional credit for the effect of serious drooling.
