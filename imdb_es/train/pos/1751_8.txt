Virgin, 40, is about Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old man who works in an electronics store, does not have a great social life and is very uncomfortable with women. Some of her co-workers in the store invite him to go out one night and discover that Andy is still a virgin, so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day in the store, Andy, he meets a woman named Trish, who gives him his phone number and, finally, Andy, has the courage to go on a date with her and they start to like each other a lot, but Andy, it's still Very uncomfortable when it comes to sex and he will have to tell this to Trish, to her embarrassment if she can really muster up enough courage to tell him before things get uncomfortable. The 40 Year Old Virgin has a good direction, a good script, good comic performances of the whole cast, good cinematography and good film editing. The film is the protagonist and is co-written by Steve Carell, who does a very good comedy performance and his writing for the film is also very good. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. It's sweet, fun, entertaining, fun, nice, smart, good-natured and a good time. This movie is as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both movies are two of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. The 40 Year Old Virgin, really shows a lot of talent, it's put to good use and it works like a comedy and a romance, and it's sweet and very funny. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
