Rock Star: INXS was the best music TV series I've ever seen! It had some of the best rock n 'roll songs ever written, performed by 15 very talented singers / performers. He also had (in my opinion) the most sincere endings, of feeling good, of surprise in all the reality shows. In fact, it made me shed tears of happiness for the winner! During the 13 weeks of this televised competition, the audience was able to meet and get acquainted with all the participants. After 30 episodes, the remaining participants seemed more friends than mere strangers competing with each other in a reality show. And the fact that INXS was, and still is, one of the best rock n 'roll bands that have just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful series of reality. If you do not have the series recorded, ROCK STAR: INXS the DVD is an excellent alternative.
