"Come Undone" seems to provoke many opinions among the collaborators of this forum. Of course, it is a movie that promises a vision of gay life, as most viewers expect and, somehow, it moves away from that promise and becomes an introspective vision of the soul of a young man. The movie has a way of staying with us even when it's over. It is a study of characters about how a young man gets involved in a love affair with someone so different from him that, in the end, will leave Mathieu confused, hurt and depressed when things do not go according to what he expected from the relationship. would be. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, maybe you would like to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastien Lifshitz, the director of the film, has told his story from Mathieu's point of view. Most viewers seem to be disoriented by the different times within the film, but there are suggestions that are not obvious, as you can see, in retrospect. The story is told in flashbacks that could be added to the way some people will see the movie. This is a story about the condemned that the love that Mathieu felt for Cedric and the definitive rupture of their life together. <br /> <br /> In the first place, Cedric, the young and handsome local, chases Mathieu until he manages to convince him. he likes Mathieu feels the attraction for Cedric too. We realize how different both young men are from the way Cedric tells Mathieu's family that he feels that school is not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cedric has taken him. We watch how Mathieu, reading the guide, wants Cedric's attention. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu goes to his mother, she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career. He also points out what future they would both have together, which proves to be true. Mathieu seems to have learned his lesson, the hard way. He continues an uncertain life with Cedric and tries to take his own life. We see him in the hospital talking to a psychiatrist who has treated his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The ending can be confusing for most viewers, but there is a moment in the movie when Mathieu goes to work in a bar. where we see him washing glasses and looking at Pierre, the young man who frequents the bar. That is why, when Mathieu goes to look for Pierre at his house, it seems difficult to imagine. However, we have seen how Mathieu is obviously interested in Pierre. The last scene on the beach, when Pierre and Mathieu are seen walking through the sand, has a hopeful signal that things will improve between them when they see a child, apparently lost, but then realize that the father is near . <Br /> <br /> Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films. This is a young man who is difficult to understand on a simple level. Mathieu has suffered a lot, first with the separation of his parents, then with his depressed mother and with the loss of Cedric. Stephan Rideau, who has been seen in other major French films, is equally good, as the superficial Cedric. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" will split the opinions, the film deserves to be seen because of the complexity and care that Sebastien Lifshitz gives to the story.
