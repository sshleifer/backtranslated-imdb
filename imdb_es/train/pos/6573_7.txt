The film has the feeling of being a work from the beginning. I think it would be better than a movie because the set design and dramatization make the film version seem too artificial. But, even so, it is done quite well, and history and especially dialogue are interesting. They have taken the dialogue almost exactly as in the real work. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's works. <br /> <br /> The main character, Raina, has her head in the clouds and her talent for the dramatic, and the performance of Helena Bonham Carter does a good job here. Her boyfriend, Serges, is a bit too caricatured when she is supposed to be a very pretty and elegant figure. His parents are entertaining enough.
