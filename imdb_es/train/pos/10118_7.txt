I really like the Miikes movies about Yakuza, this one that I saw about 2 years ago and it really filled my head. I had never seen such a sick and twisted thing before. The story is good and the actors do their thing very well. I have not seen the UK or Japan version, but I must say that I think the German DVD is a bit censored. If you have not yet seen the movie and you live in Germany, maybe you better look for a Nederlands or Austria DVD. The I-ON DVD contains many very difficult and unpleasant scenes, but in the showdown I felt that something was missing, one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> In general, a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's what I like about Miike!
