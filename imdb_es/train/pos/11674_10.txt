The planning episodes were a bit boring, but when they got to the desert it was quite fun to watch them. The reason why I call it the most realistic reality show is because, to my surprise, Charley left the race relatively early. When his hands were sore, he expected the usual stress and then a miraculous solution, but instead, he left the race. The most anxious moment of the show must have been when Max was trapped in the desert with almost no food or water! The end was great and I was very happy to see that at least one of the team members did it. In general, it is not as good as the Long Way Round, but it is definitely an interesting watch, since one can take a look at the most challenging race in the world.
