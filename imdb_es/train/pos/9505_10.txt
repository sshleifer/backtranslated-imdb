This is a truly magnificent and heartbreaking movie !!!! The locations of Ripstein are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extraordinary García Márquez, without a doubt. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us outstanding performances like the colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> You must see it !!!
