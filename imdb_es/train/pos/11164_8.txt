In Brooklyn, a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their volunteer fire fighting bodies leads to Brodie's famous bet that he can jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be familiar to many people through a parody of Bugs Bunny, "Bowery Bugs" of 1949. <br /> <br /> This usually very nice movie would probably be more available if it were not for the notorious scene and disturbing that it involves some inhabitants of Chinese dwellings, a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes, which give the film a great historical interest, in my opinion.
