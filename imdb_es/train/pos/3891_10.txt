One of the best comedians of all time. I have seen this program about 10 times and probably will see at least 100 more. My friends and family quote from this DVD so often that one would think we did nothing more than watch it. The initial part about Alcatraz is a bit slow, but browse it or move towards the part where Eddie is on stage. Look out for the "Pastel or Death" part (joking about the Church of England) and the "Hitler / Pol Pot" part (Hard to explain, just look). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. You can really say a lot with your eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eye shadow probably help, huh?) Fair warning: Eddie has a tendency to add many four-letter words.
