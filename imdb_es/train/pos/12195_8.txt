Any film in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph until the third man with Joseph Cotton. It is also wonderful in a touch of evil. Please, see them all! He tends to become pompous and self-sufficient in films like F is for Fake, a really stupid movie loss. Do not waste your time watching it. It is really ignorant. Orson Welles is an icon of the film and anyone who studies film should see everything he has filmed. All his major ladies are tremendous, but in the end Welles became a fat drunk, like his character in A Touch Of Evil! For some reason, Orson Welles had some skill with women, I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on and on, but I digress ... and because I am a woman, I can see the attraction towards him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true filmmakers and, unless you have the filmmakers of today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most of the filmmakers are not up to the filmmakers of the forties! I know there are many more great filmmakers today, but in such a short time I can not name them all. No offense to any of the great filmmakers of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Please remind me of some current and future filmmakers, I do not want to be stuck in the past! Now I love some of the movies, but there are rarely any that put on the list of the "100 best" ... "Hustle and Flow" was great, so was "Fargo" and "Oh, brother, where are you ?, "of a line in Sullivan's travels; Another good movie from the forties! Can anyone give me a better list for the 90s and until 2006? I would like to know who to look at! Thank you! Also supports to this website! Where else can you connect a movie or boo? I love the criticism of normal people like me who can say what I want and I promise not to ruin any movie for someone who has not seen it yet!
