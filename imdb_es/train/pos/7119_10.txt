My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (retired Major of the Marine Corps of the United States), was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg to the Japanese, and he also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to know that my father was the technical advisor of this film and I hope that it has had an impact on the film so that it resembles what it really was then, as I read in several comments written by the viewers of This movie that It looked like real life. My father is a fan of facts and figures, and I always wanted things to look the way they were, so I'd like to believe that it had something to do with that. <br /> <br /> Currently lives in Okinawa, Japan. married to my mother for more than 40 years (ironically, she is Japanese), and a few years ago she received one of the highest praises from the Emperor of Japan for her contribution and the activities of bringing Kendo and Iaido back to Japan since McArthur he banned them after WWII. <br /> <br /> My father was once a Marine, but I know that once you are a Marine, you are always a Marine. And that is exactly what he is and I love him and I respect him very much. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie if someone has a copy. And I would love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!
