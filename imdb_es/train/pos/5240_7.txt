Part of the performance was a bit suspicious. I remember that the mocking Alexander Walker (critic of Evening Standard, yes it's fine, now he's dead) launched into a tirade about this movie saying it was a disgrace that portrayed the NI protesters as murderers. Now, with respect to all the NI Protestants, this movie was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers (who were loyal) and who were wandering around Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing. My main regret about this film is that it does not show any ray of light or hope, everything is pessimism, I mean that the girl finally had to die. Maybe this sounds corny but I could have taken the tact that not all Prods & tiags are bad or totally good either.
