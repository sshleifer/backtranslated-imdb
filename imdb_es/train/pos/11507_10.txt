I vividly remember the original series mainly because of its unique blend of ironic humor and macabre theme. Kolchak was a tough journalist from the big city reporting school Ben Hecht, and his harsh determination and intelligent behavior made even the most mundane episode visible. My personal favorite was "The Spanish Moss Murders" because of its totally original story. A poor young man with Cajun problems from Louisiana Bayou, participates in a dream research experiment, with the purpose of analyzing dreams. Something goes inexplicably wrong, and he, literally, dreams of the life of a swamp creature that inhabits the dark folk tales of his youth. This malevolent manifestation looks for all the people who have done wrong to the dreamer in his conscious state and brutally suffocates them to death. Kolchak investigates and discovers this horrible truth, to the chagrin of police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (beautifully rehearsed by a grumpy Keenan Wynn) and the principal investigator of the dream played by Severn Darden, founder of the second city, Severn Darden, to have fun . The perversely funny and heartbreaking ending takes place in the Chicago sewer system, and is a highlight of the series. Kolchak never got better. Eternal.
