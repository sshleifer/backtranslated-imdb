['I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this drama so carefully presented, that due to its almost impressive rating of 6.6, I almost missed it; As I rarely give the time of day to a movie rated below 7/10. Having said that, I am very happy to have given Stone Angel what he deserved. And so should you, if you are one of the types of sensitive, moving and reflective people increasingly rare that remain on this earth in living form. <br /><br /> I must say that in many ways (though not all), namely. His themes, execution, style, production, etc., Stone Angel reminded me a lot to the praised &quot;The Notebook&quot;. I am so surprised that other commentators have not realized the many similarities that have repeatedly surprised me throughout this film, so I can only assume that those who have written comments have yet to see the Notebook. They may not share any topic about Alzheimer&#39;s disease, but I can say with confidence that if you enjoyed &quot;The Notebook&quot; a lot, you will surely find a lot to take advantage of your time in the most fruitful way with &quot;The Stone Angel&quot;. But even if you have not seen The Notebook, or read the book on which this movement is based (which, by the way, I have not seen), you should definitely find a lot to keep your attention firmly, as long as your favorite genres do not include fast action thrillers. This is a movie for thinkers and those who like to remember the passage of time, how life changes as the years go by, and what might have happened in one&#39;s life when one looks through the years. <br /><br /> This strangely underestimated but excellent movie really deserves a rating of about 8/10. I can only blame his current low score of 6.6 / 10 on 11% of the idiots who gave him 1/10. After all, it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of writing this comment. However, if the 11% who gave the lowest possible classification really expected car chases and explosions, why did not they see ... even for a few seconds the premise and the promotional lines of the film? Oh, honey ... whatever it is that comes to the world, do not miss the most underestimated jewel in a movie, but only * if * you * have a brain (that is, your top ten does not include Transformers, Fight Club or The Terminator) .']
