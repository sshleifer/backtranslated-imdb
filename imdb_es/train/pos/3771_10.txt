1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time: TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. Out of the two, I have always liked the BILL & TED BOGUS trip a little better. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is the best done, but there's nothing like Bill and Ted. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it's hard to think of a better comic duo than Bill and Ted. They are unique in their class. <br /> <br /> Apparently influenced by National Lampoon's O.C. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in L.A. in the decade of 1980. The two quickly began to write a script on two and in a short time was born EXCELLENT ADVENTURE OF BILL & TED. The film, filmed in 1987 and released in 1989, became a blockbuster and an instant cult classic. It was not long before the work on the sequel began. Stephen Herek, the director of "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE" was not interested in working on the sequel, since he considered it too petty and, unlike the first, Peter Hewitt, who made his film debut, was in charge of directing the continuation. There could not be a better director for the job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is wonderfully run. It is full of its own unique style and energy that can not be combined. <br /> <br /> What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY' one of the best sequels of all is that, although it's darker than the original, it's just so much fun. It does not change the characters like most of the sequels. Bill and Ted are the same adorable characters that were in the first movie. This is because it was written by the original writers. Most of the sequels are not written by the same writers as the first, but as 'BOGUS JOURNEY' had the same writers, ended up being as good as 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE', if not even better. Like the first, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is absolutely hilarious, well written, fun and, above all, original. It is full of spectacular special effects and fantastic comic performances by Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It is an unforgettable 'trip'. 10/10
