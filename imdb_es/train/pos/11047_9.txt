I waited a few years before this movie was finally released in England, but I was very happy when I finally saw it. There are many good things in the movie, to start the performance. It's not something I need so badly in a horror movie, but the people in this movie do a good job. This and the constantly exciting and interesting script, with a nice love feeling from Lovecraftian, give the film a true solid backbone. Add to this the dose of nightmare images of surreal and occasional gruesome gore and movies a winner. He also has my favorite type of blood, supernatural and splash. In addition, the characters of Marcus, the angry transgender bodybuilder and Daisy, his lover / toy with mental retardation are genuinely extravagant and disconcerting at times, and give a sense of morbid adult madness that works well with frequent Freudian nuances. This is one of the most impressive recent horror films, much more shocking or anything else that Hollywood can produce. My only complaint was that I wanted the end to be darker, but it still works, so I would generally recommend it to terror fans.
