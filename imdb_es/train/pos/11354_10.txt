CitizenX (1995) is the response of the developing world to the silence of the lambs. Where 'Silence' terrorized our peace of mind, 'Citizen' exhausts us and makes us sad. This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates quite well, thanks to a westernized friendship between two Rostov policemen who become equals. <br /> <br /> CitizenX can also argue against (!) the death penalty much better than the Life of Kevin Spacey David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> Humans are Machiavellian mammals, under which are the limbic brains (lizard logic). Why did two children, who knew better, kill a child they kidnapped? Why do bloodthirsty women shout 'li-lilililililii' to acts of terrorism OBSCENO? - My own term for this is 'limbic domination', the lizard logic needs to dominate an 'enemy'. If you have the words "enemy" / "revenge" in your vocabulary, you are easily able to "limbic domination". <br /> <br /> In the 1980s devastated by World War II, Rostov (located at the mouth of the Don River). near the Black Sea), nothing repressed Andrei Chikatilo's need for "limbic domination" to dominate his layers of civilization. The easy victims of Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn) were poor, usually children, who traveled on the interurban train for fun, since they could not pay for anything else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that the denials of an unbridled Soviet The bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 of these "lambs". Rostov's serial killer was released for almost 7 years AFTER the police were arrested and let him go. <br /> <br /> The politicization of the fight against crime is detrimental to police forces around the world. Although police surveillance routinely suffers from corruption throughout the world, in the west, the hoarding of votes by politicians can establish chronic rivalries between agencies, which hinders a more coordinated response to crime. In the Soviet Union of CitizenX, however, the Assassins Department of Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea) suffered from a repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey DeMunn interprets the psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with an impeccable but discreet authority, for Point of complete darkness. In real life, too, Chikatilo had the experience of a lifetime mixing and evading capture. <br /> <br /> His persecutor, on the other hand, stands out like a strange bird, given to uninvited and naive outbursts. Perhaps by design, Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as the forensic chief Burakov. The Russian accent of Rhea is impenetrable; and his Burakov has no humor and is sullen, at odds with everyone. <br /> <br /> So it's Donald Sutherland who walks away with the image. Sutherland's colleague, Fetisov, the head of Burakov and, at first, his only supporter, is a very restrained and patient militiaman, whose dignified chariot bears witness to decades of bureaucratic machinations. His reactivation as a policeman driven by logic and still passionate becomes the idealism of the cornerstone of the film. Joss Ackland takes another turn as a vicious apparatchik, the Secretary of Communist Ideology Bondarchuk, who oversees the investigation. Naturally, he crushed the arrest of the most likely suspect, a communist, in 1984, a man who carried a rope and a knife in his bag, allegedly going to his house: Andrei Chikatilo. <br /> <br /> Soon, he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik, Detective Gorbunov (John Wood), insisting that the investigation now focus on "known homosexuals". The funniest scene of this sad and sad film comes during the institutionalized harassment of Bondarchuk and Gorbunov: a stupid policeman reports seriously: "As I suspected, comrade, it's a fornication." I made some drawings, like a howling laugh. <br /> <br /> 5 years after the bodies began to accumulate, in 1987, the police finally tried to request criminal profiles.The only Soviet psychiatrist who cooperated was Dr. Aleksandr Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), who called the UNSUB " CitizenX. "Later, he also observed Fetisov and Burakov that" ... together they make a wonderful person. "We agree. <br /> <br /> The prolonged pace, which spread over a decade, It perfectly captures the institutional inertia of Glasnost, the "opening", which was not so.The contrast with Perestroika - "restructuring" - could not have been greater for the case.Although Chikatilo was still lurking the stations of railway, the plans of the police were about to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> In 1990, Colonel Fetisov was quickly promoted to General. His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared from the scene, allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference. Staff, communications, advertising, suddenly all were available. In just one night of phone calls, Fetisov got his depressed forensic chief to access the FBI's serial assassination task force at Quantico, where, according to Fetisov, the staff is regularly expelled from serial homicide cases to avoid the psychological damage to the researchers. /> <br /> Fetisov informs his recently promoted forensic chief, now 'Colonel' Burakov, of all these changes in an avalanche of confessions that becomes the most powerful scene in the basin. Fetisov is the most tender apology I have seen in the film: `In private, I offer my sincere apologies to you and your wife. I hope someday you can forgive me my ignorance, "he almost whispers. <br /> <br /> An HBO production, CitizenX is a film of the highest caliber, not only do the exteriors look truly grim (filmed exclusively in the most depressed from the spectacular Budapest), but the incredible soundtrack of Randy Edelman is completely overwhelming, and is often our only respite from the grim brutality, those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits. <br /> <br /> The actual killings of Chikatilo are depicted as somber and aberrant behavior, born of flaws of character and ignorance in an equally grim world, which makes the killings seem not totally out of place, but of course they were. President Kennedy reminded us, 'We all appreciate the future of our children'. <br /> <br /> CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is much more creepy I Bottom of what any fantasy of revenge could imply. Serial rapists violate to dominate; Serial killers kill to dominate. This is what some soldiers do. Such 'limbic rulers' make humans poor. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILER: ----------------------------- --------- --------- The real Andrei Chikatilo WAS the most prolific known serial killer in the world. Convicted, he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all death sentences in the Soviet Union: a shot in the back of the head. Foolishly, such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviated brain after death. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best result is always the prevention of murders, not their prosecution. The executions simply guarantee the failure of society to learn from the complex reality of the deaths of the victims when we even sent anecdotal evidence of HOW / WHY they died. Murderers do not repent if they are dead. <br /> <br /> Revenge does not destroy the victims. Lying down in favor of the killer's blood is nothing better than fighting domination: once it's too late. <br /> <br /> Revenge in the name of affliction is not justice for the deceased, it is appeasing the living (10). / 10)
