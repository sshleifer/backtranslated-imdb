Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to watch a show with him. She agrees with the condition that they do not exchange any information between them, not even the names. Sometimes these are the best quotes. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife has been murdered. His alibi is the mysterious woman, but no one can remember having seen her and, as a result of this, Scott is condemned to die for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and seeks the woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind the Kansas Attempts to get to the truth. We follow her through some memorable scenes, for example, her search for Mac, the bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and the claustrophobic place where Cliff, the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) takes her to hang out, to drink and dance while he sings with his friends. . This is such a brazen description of sexual desire that is a prominent part of the film, as everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically throughout the duration of the scene. Ella Raines is good in the female lead role and Thomas Gomez makes a nice cop. Alan Curtis started well as the confused and innocent man, but once he was arrested, his performance took a left turn and became completely unpleasant for Kansas for no reason. God knows why she stayed with him. <br /> <br /> The movie does not keep you guessing who the killer is as we know him from the middle of the movie, but this does not matter. In fact, it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story, as we will in Kansas to discover what is happening and then go to hell! It's a good movie with some great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Jr. has a memorable role, I never like anything in what I see ... someone gives me a tie ...
