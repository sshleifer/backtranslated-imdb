This movie is finally on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this film so many times and it seems to me even current these days (2003), when Italy suffers again a kind of brainwashing dictatorship (or the United States). I'm glad that there are pariahs like the one Mastroianni plays in this movie and that she can sing out of tune; Maybe they can teach the Sophia Lorens of this world to be strong and fight to be recognized as human beings. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: as most of the people here already mentioned, the performance is wonderful but the audio background is amazing I must assume that, unfortunately, something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the deployment of machinery, the distortion of reality in that always-present radio-chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome can really shake! <br /> <br /> A masterpiece! <br /> <br />
