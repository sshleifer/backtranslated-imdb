['The ship could have sunk but the movie did not! The director, James Cameron, of &#39;The Terminator&#39; did it again with this incredible image. One of my favorite scenes is the &#39;Dinner table&#39; scene, in which Rose&#39;s family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that all women should have when they meet &quot;THE ONE&quot; ... I hope to have that look when I&#39;m in the room with my future husband. <br /><br /> Jack and Rose have a connection that is &quot;MOVIE FILM&quot;, but it is a good movie. We have the greedy mother and all her elite associates who live on the wealth of their husbands. Rose almost killed herself, but the star of Gilbert Grape rescues her. I really liked hanging on the boat scene. It was a good risk. <br /><br /> The movie is long but it&#39;s fantastic! Good story, good flow, good actors! Go see it twice if you want, it&#39;s worth it !!!']
