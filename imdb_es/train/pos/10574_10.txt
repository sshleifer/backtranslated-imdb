['This is a wonderful movie. The non-stop pattern takes several observations to fully appreciate. The musical productions of Busby Berkeley will never be duplicated. I think this movie easily surpasses all his other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together. Part of the humor would almost push the limits of today&#39;s movies. Put a rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the show that it is.']
