This is a great "small" movie. I say "small" because it does not have hundreds of shots or a dozen explosions, like in a John Woo movie. Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. The film is very easy to see, the story is more a thread than a washing machine; instead of everything going and coming around, things seem to get worse as the plot gets complicated. Wonderful ending, very positive. I never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can not be very different from the movie because I FEEL that I'm watching an Elmore Leonard movie.
