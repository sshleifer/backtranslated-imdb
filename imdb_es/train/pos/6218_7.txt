79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers never did anything other than great movies together. Although this is not one of the best, it is an excellent musical. There are some outstanding musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make memorable presentations on the first screens. The ball is particularly good, and a blonde too. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best numbers of the musical duo. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet" plays the sister of Ginger Roger. The basic plot is quite familiar, but with an exceptional cast, it works. Excellent direction of art and score.
