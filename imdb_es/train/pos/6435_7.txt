I think most people who have commented on this film do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have little sense of elegance. First, to evaluate a movie, you must understand to what extent everything in the movie works together. Modern sensibilities demand great drama. No, I do not mean the great configuration of characters and plots, but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are very tragic or very comical. This is a subtle movie. Its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. It's a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of the combination of sensuality, politics, human weakness, venality ... whatever. The world in which it is established would be strange and will not be understood today ... a world in which if you have it, you have to flaunt it NOW, even if you only think you have it. <br /> <br /> Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian as people understand that term today. <br /> <br /> This movie helps clear things up.
