I thought that for a first episode of a first series he did really well. It was very fun and I thought the actors were brilliant. I think it's a crime for someone to say it was bad because it seemed like the right time. I find it really annoying when people say it was not historically correct, since it's supposed to be an entertainment show on Saturday nights, not a boring historical documentary, so I think the costumes and setup were the right ones. A brilliant start and I will love what will come next! I have spoken with many people in my school and they love the program! We all think that it is a brilliant entertainment and that it has great stories to accompany it.
