Seeing this again after a lapse of many years and remembering the failure that occurred in its original release, I am surprised how well it has remained. One of the reasons for his failure was that a generation only thought it was an indulgent shit and a younger one was disappointed not to show all the hippie glory. Seen now, it is clear that Antonioni was already conscious and fascinated by the mixture of fervent enthusiasm for change and the lack of a clear vision for the future. The main pair is excellent and it is shameful that they have received so much criticism for the perceived failure of the film. They are ideal and transmit perfectly the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure pleasure in making love. I blame others for the emphasis on the student revolt sequences at the beginning, but I have to say that from now on it is one of the most beautiful looking images of the directors and that it undoubtedly got the best of the natural landscapes and facts for man. Oh, and I have not even mentioned the highly explosive ending.
