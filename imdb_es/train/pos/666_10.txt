Episode two of season one is a lovely holiday tale of love, betrayal, ... and a crazy, homicidal, and escaped dressed as Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) has just murdered her husband. On Christmas Eve for your life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive like a madman, the Santa Claus suit worn by a psychopath (Larry Drake, perfectly exaggerated) threatens his life ... as well as his precious daughters. <br /> <br /> This episode is well remembered even by those who are familiar with the program. By the way, this particular critic sees it every Christmas on a routine basis. Most notable for its suspenseful climbing and narrative twists, and All Through The Houst is among the best of Tales From The Crypt.
