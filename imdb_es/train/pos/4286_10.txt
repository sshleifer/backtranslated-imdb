I saw this movie (its title in English is "Who's singing there?") At the Montreal International Film Festival in 1980. It won raves then ... and it disappeared. A terrible shame. It is brilliant. Sublime, ridiculous, sad and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. It's been 19 years and I've only seen a handful of comedies (or any other genre) that can match their originality.
