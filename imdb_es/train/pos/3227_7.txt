Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action thriller by Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Set on a garbage planet, Soldier plays as a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell barely speaking as the Title of the character, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for dead. The cast of support from the settlers, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly shaggy Michael Chiklis, is capable. They spend most of the movie scared of Russell, and the rest running for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he has ever given. Almost without words to say, it transmits emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and glances. It's almost a mime performance. When the action sequences start up, he kicks his ass, and he does it in a strong, silent and practical way. There are flaws. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a great impression of Frank Burns from M * A * S * H ​​as a commanding officer, and Gary Busey breaks a stupid (and almost breaks his belt) as a mentor to Todd. This is an underrated and excellent science fiction movie, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the Blade Runner universe: David Webb Peoples wrote both scripts.
