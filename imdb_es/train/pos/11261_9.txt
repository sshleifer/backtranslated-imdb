This masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from the exploitation master Joseph W. Sarno. It has a lot of soft sex, very attractive lesbian sequences and many naked women. The acting is pretty good and the movie is quite atmospheric and well done. Mary Forsa is one of the most attractive girls I've seen in a horror movie. It is a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body. Sarno really knows how to choose attractive women. It must be seen for fans of sexploitation!
