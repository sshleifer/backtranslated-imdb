The events of September 11, 2001 do not need an additional human interest in how to follow the training of the novice firefighter or the progress of the two French brothers. In my opinion, it would have been better to leave this out. I think the directors tried too hard, maybe they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop. The comment of one of the policemen: "this is not the world of Disney" is appropriate. <br /> <br /> However, it is a convincing observation for the description of the events. The filmmakers were in the right places at the right times, no other image of the day matches what they filmed.
