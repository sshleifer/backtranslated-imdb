When reflecting on this film, I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. One relatively forgettable, but covering the same geography, is the Torchon Strike, the other thousands of miles away and much wider in scope is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis has produced a film that has some of the great foundations of Indochine, the complex and tacit relationship between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the dignity of Potee, with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his companions and with his white bosses. I was also impressed by the love / hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its driving force, it is the latter that links this film with Indochine. <br /> <br /> You're never sure what motivates everyone, although some of the characters must remember them. colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that links him to Coup de Torchon. His is the most scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis reminds us how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The American black that yields to adult France, a trip to the beginning and end of the film, offers another interesting side of the confusion we have in the Western world when we look at Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother. He came home, but they thought he was a bit silly. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but none of them fully understands what it is, although they can remember how it was. <br /> <br />
