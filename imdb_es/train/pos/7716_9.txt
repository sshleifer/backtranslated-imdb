There is a good reason why Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his crew of the relief ship, things he does not dare to dream about. <br /> <br /> Like Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that arrived on this planet 20 years earlier. Since then he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, Anne Francis. They are the only human beings left on this planet, which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as Krell. <br /> <br /> The records deciphered by Pidgeon indicate that Krell reached a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. The machinery that they left behind continues to work. <br /> <br /> It may be working too well when the members of the relief party begin to die and in a particular frightful way. <br /> <br /> I see all kinds of speculations about a remake and this is a movie not to redo because it is as recent as it was in 1956. The terms would change, now we would say deformation speed instead of hyperactivity. , courtesy of the enduring popularity of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We may not see the men on the relief expedition in a flying saucer as a spaceship. It may look a lot like the Starship Enterprise or the 2001 Ship A Space Odyssey. It is interesting to watch science fiction films from different generations and see how the conceptions of the future change. <br /> <br /> The story behind Planeta Prohibido is timeless, about mortal beings trying to interpret God. <Br /> <br /> You can not write about Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical wonder, elaborated by Pidgeon with the knowledge he acquired when studying the Krell, was a great success in the past. He obtained a new life contract in the sixties with the character of the Lost In Space Robot. His scenes with Earl Holliman, who plays the cook on the space ship and his fulfillment of Earl's request for some home spirits, are very funny. <br /> <br /> Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but they were lost to The Ten Commandments and the separation of the Red Sea. The bad luck of Forbidden Planet to face a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> The classicists among you will recognize Forbidden Planet as a futuristic rework of The Tempest that, when one thinks, it could have been Shakespeare's. venture into science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite among the cast is Warren Stevens, whose sacrifice allows Leslie Nielsen to know exactly what he's dealing with. <br /> <br /> Never miss this when it is issued.
