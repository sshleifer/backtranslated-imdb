Beautiful film with a great soundtrack that spans the rocky landscape of the 70s and 80s. Radiography describes a generation, describes life in a small town near Correggio (hometown of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film), describes the life of young people and their problems related to the world. Remember Trainspotting, with an Italian touch.
