Although it is not a horror movie in the traditional sense, this creepy little movie delivers the goods. It seems that a vampire is loose in a small German city draining his victims of his blood. The police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his first papers, is skeptical to believe that a crazed killer, not a vampire, is going crazy. The only one who believes it is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), the girlfriend of the inspector and laboratory assistant of Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who, although apparently an eminent scientist, agrees with the theory of vampires. The townspeople suspect that the weird Herman Gleib, played with his usual frenzy of Dwight Frye, who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role. The film contains a lot of humor that helps alleviate some of the intensity involved with all the murders committed. A funny part is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), the aunt of Ruth Bertin, thinking that the strange Herman has not turned into a bat, but into a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This budget movie brings elements from "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" with Dr. Niemann using the power of suggestion to make a sleepwalker carry out his "Frankenstein" orders using human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and "Dracula", since everyone believes that the murders, except the inspector and his girl, are the work of a bloodsucker. These elements are well mixed by the director Frank R. Strayer with a small comedy released in good measure. The brew works. The restored version I saw used tinting to increase the spooky atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
