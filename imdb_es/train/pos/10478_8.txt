<br /> <br /> This is definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hiding place, trying to avoid being caught by parents, teachers, the police, etc. The protagonist is a lady in her forties, who lives in her mansion, who grows orchids, and who does not know at all the fact that her supposed rich and truthful husband, in reality, is devastated and cheats her. When he suddenly dies, she faces the truth. The sheriff comes to tell you that he is in great debt. She does not know what to do, until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in Britain. After a long time of thinking, decide that you should get rid of your flowers and start growing pots ... The story is quite original, the performances are exceptional! I can only think of some movies that made me laugh more than this one. Still, the melodramatic touch is present. The film is typical British: the jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence involved. It should not be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken some drafts before seeing "Salvando la gracia". It will be much more fun! Especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious. I thought my jaws would burst. 9/10
