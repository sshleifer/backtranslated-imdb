['I have spent years looking for a copy of this movie (16 mm, dvd, vhs), to be able to show it to my children. The movie is fun, and Spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business. They had to be so good to play that insane one. I like it and I recommend it for movie lovers of all ages. <br /><br /> The film is about a fire station at the turn of the century, with a group of misfits who are firefighters and the department band (when they are not fighting fires). There are the usual gags to run, plus the chaos of Spike Jones and his Orchestra. Also, comedy relief provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and straight man Hugh O&#39;Brien.']
