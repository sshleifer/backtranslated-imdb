Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is excellent, all the technical aspects (especially the cinematography) are clear and the script is intelligent. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is great as Edward '' Ned '' Kelly. He is clinging to the legendary outlaw, and has the support of Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All the action sequences are at the point <br /> <br /> The film is edge material from your seat to the end. One of my favorite films of the legendary deceased Heath Ledger, who has been the highlight of all the films he has starred. And do not be mistaken here. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie for everyone.
