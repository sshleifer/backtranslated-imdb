I was about 7 when I saw this movie for the first time. It was not so special then, but a few years later I saw him again and that time he made fun of me a lot :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the movie are: Yeti's body language and the 'effects specials' too. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, do not expect a blockbuster made in Hollywood, even this movie was made from approx. 1000 dollars :) <br /> <br /> I also have a copy of it. Movie and video version (but I do not think it has ever been seen in cinemas) <br /> <br /> See Â¡Enjoy it !!! Yeti forever !!!
