If you are under 13 years old or over 13 and you are quite intoxicated, you will enjoy D-war. If you're a fan of all kinds of brainless action movies, you'll enjoy D-war. Otherwise, do not bother! Today I saw the movie with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved him and that made me feel good. Once the movie was over, all the children (my nephews and their friends) could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. <br /> <br /> The CG is good. Acting and directing are horrible. The plot is extremely simple. But, as half of the audience were children, they shouted, shouted and shouted every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the visual experience so much more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to take your kids, but except for the final battle sequence, D-War is disappointing. I give this movie 7 out of 10, mainly because the kids loved it.
