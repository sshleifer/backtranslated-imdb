Along with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was an iconic villain of Columbo. The first "appropriate" episode of Columbo, after two independent pilots, "Murder By The Book" is not far from the classic state. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half of a murder mystery writing association. His partner Jim is the talented, while Ken has no other talent than the gift of gab and an ability to promote books. As soon as Jim has decided that he no longer needs Ken's marketing skills, Ken hatches a plan to kill Jim. Except that it's not a new plot, it's actually the real-life implementation of a murder story originally designed for one of his books. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for Columbo to realize that Ken is the killer, though, unfortunately, another murder must be carried out (Ken romances and then kills a key witness) before Columbo has proof. enough to secure a conviction. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with "Murder By The Book", but it's not like that. quite top notch. I would simply give "Publish Or Perish" the advantage over this: the two episodes include Jack Cassidy and the world of the publication, but "Publish Or Perish" is a more tense and unpredictable fraction. But this is still a great episode.
