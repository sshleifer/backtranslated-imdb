EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the emotion that must have come with the birth of the narrative film almost a century ago. This film is truly unique, and a work of genius. The camera work and editing are brilliant, and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film, create a strange and unforgettable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast are two. Guilty pleasures that must be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow provides his great voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> A unique movie! Four stars (highest rating).
