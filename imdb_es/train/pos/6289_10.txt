This movie has taken a lot of stick. He was scheduled by critics when he left and was accused of destroying Nicolas Cage's career. What I do not think people understand is that it does not intend to be an epic, the Oscar nominee of a movie, it's just a brilliant action "Bruck-buster" at its best. Fast cars, fast editing and a great soundtrack: it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also, for anyone who likes cars, it's pure pleasure. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and let's not forget Eleanor! I think it would be hard to find a better action movie and, personally, a better movie! Then again, maybe it's just me!
