This movie is great fun. I recommend that you look at it yourself and then see it again with your friends. I did it last night and it was fascinating how well Norma Khouri could attract everyone to her world! I felt a little strange to see my friends cross the same roller coaster as the first time. But everyone thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie talking about the movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a scammer almost up to Norma Khouri's level, but not near the ring of the same size. He cheated people very credulous and rich in my old Berkeley CA A.A. Group where everyone trusts everyone else. He "sponsored" only the people who seemed very well to do. Who knew I would have stolen more than 100k (in 1987, when it was real money) after having been in the city for only 1 month. Their victims were very fragile, since they were in their first month or week of being sober. He was evil with a big laugh and a big smile on his face. <br /> <br /> The above crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did to her old neighbor. But I do not want to reveal anything. <br /> <br /> I found this one night in a nightly movie channel, I think "Showtim". This is always the best experience of movie fans to be totally deceived to see something and blow your mind. Just drag your friends to see this and do not tell them anything. It's a very entertaining movie, it moves fast and it never bores you. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic forever. I think all the great movies finally reach the top. The weather will be very good for this movie. I only regret that no one has heard of that yet, in some way that makes the surprises even better. <br /> <br /> The director and the editor were fantastic. They deserved to win the best documentary. <br /> <br /> JUST LOOK AT THIS MOVIE!
