Released a few months before the end of the war, "Anchors Aweigh" is one of Gene Kelly's biggest musical triumphs of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> Under the direction of George Sidney, he had the benefits of a nice score and, best of all, the services of Gene Kelly in his first lead role at MGM. The previous year, in Columbia's "Cover Girl," he had revealed an innovative approach to screen dancing, a light but pleasant singing voice and considerable charm in "Anchors Aweigh," even though it was cataloged by Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson. Was he laying the solid foundation for his most revealing years at MGM? <br /> <br /> The story of the film, a kind of dry race for "On the Town" four years later, follows Mariners Kelly and Sinatra on their vacations on the coast, they spend their vacations in Hollywood, where get involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer (Grayson) and his nephew (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> It seems that Grayson has his heart in an audition with the conductor and pianist Jos√© Iturbi. She gets the hearing, of course; Kelly gets Grayson after some misunderstandings; and Sinatra, he has forgotten to be shy and has lost his heart for a girl from Brooklyn (Pamela Britton). <br /> <br /> The plot is conventional for the period but, unfortunately, now seems barely tolerable? But there's Gene Kelly, who dominates the movie with his nice personality. Maybe he smiles too much, but when he's allowed to dance, does the film finally get up off the floor? <br /> <br /> "I Begged Her", his first song and dance with Sinatra, is funny and a bit absurd, in which he imagines himself as a bandit chief in a Spanish courtyard, courting Grayson with a flamenco flamenco. And some athletic jumps? She also does a lovely Mexican dance with little Sharon McManus in the plaza of a Mexican settlement in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the famous Kelly dance with the cartoon character Jerry the Mouse. (of the fame of "Tom and Jerry"). Charming and innovative, he cleverly combines live action and animation in his story about a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly, a sailor from the "Pomeranian Army", dressed in a shirt Stripes and a beret, shows you how to dance? "Look at me, I'm dancing!" says the cheerful king of mice ...
