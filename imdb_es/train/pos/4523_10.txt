When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was in the fight in this movie, my expectations of seeing the whole movie were low. The only reasons I gave a chance were the great Julie Walters and the recommendation of a friend. <br /> <br /> What I thought would be a broad farce like "Mrs. Doubtfire" turned out to be a kind person and insightful Comedy. Pasdar is completely credible and understanding as the ambitious businessman who needs to release the feminine part of his being at times as a transvestite. He transmits these needs to the audience in a totally credible way. Julie Walters is magnificent, it's like her habit, like the landlady who teaches her unconditional love.
