Finally, an independent film that actually offers some great fears! I see most of the horror films that come out ... theatrical, directly to DVD, cable, etc ... and most of them stink ... some you can see ... even less are really good ... Dark Remains He is one of the good ones. I caught a screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it! Having no name actors, I assume that the budget in this movie was quite low, but you would not know ... the movie looks fantastic ... the performance works totally for the movie ... the story is good ... and the fears are great! While most filmmakers focus solely on fear, they often forget the development of story and character, two things that help deliver fear more efficiently. Brian Avenet-Bradley should know that the character and the story are important. It develops to the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters and, therefore, you get more scared when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> Watching horror movies that cost between $ 80 million and $ 5000 to make, I find that "Dark Remains" is one of the gems out there. Watch this movie!
