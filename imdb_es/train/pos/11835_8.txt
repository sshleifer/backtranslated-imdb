Although I had wanted to see this movie from the first time I saw the trailer, I was very surprised by this movie. While some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a bit too comical, 'the dark nature of the film really makes this a very different experience. Instead of the story of feeling good, happy, this movie takes you in another direction that proves to be edifying, but also disturbing. Most children will not understand some of the darkest moments in the film, which makes this film quite visible to adults. I was also impressed by the cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a perfect network of panoramas and twists. The musical score was once again solid, which shows that Hans Zimmer is the boy to turn to when it comes to animated scores, and I never thought he would say that I really enjoyed the music of Brian Adams.
