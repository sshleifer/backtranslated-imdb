When Tsui Hark experiences, nothing and no one can resist it. The legend of Zu is possibly 6 hours condensed at 1h40. One does not understand everything, but as in "2001 A Space Odyssey", you do not have to do it either, but you feel the power of the film in every second, in every image. An extraordinary vision of the future of the seventh art and one of the most pioneering, amazing and joyful of recent years. VITAL MASTERPIECE severe! It is absolutely perfect as it is. <br /> <br /> When Tsui Hark experiences, nothing and no one can stand it. The legend of Zu is possibly 6 hours condensed at 1h40.
