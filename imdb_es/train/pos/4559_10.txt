My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. In his 22 years of life, he has seen nothing but the walls of our house and his school, which is also occupied with other disabled children. I have been the target of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and I still think to this day that no one is, or will never mind a curse for her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what Christy's family was going through. But they were lucky. Christy could talk, he could communicate and had artistic abilities. My sister can walk, but she can not say a word, and she can not use her hands to do anything other than hold on to things. but this movie made me realize that there were other people in the world like my sister, and the end (to tell the truth) made me cry. And I have seen SHAWSHANK! This movie is seriously underestimated, and should not. This movie says something to people. that people should be proud of their own lives thinking that you can not write well? This guy wrote with his foot. Thinking you're not attractive? This guy was rejected by many girls, due to his condition. Is not it the fastest runner? Christy could not even stand up. <br /> <br /> My point: parents of young children, I suggest your children watch this movie with you, so they know the next time they see someone in the street in a wheelchair, they do not look at them as if they were extraterrestrials. My sister received millions of looks and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people that people who may not seem "normal" are also people. 10/10
