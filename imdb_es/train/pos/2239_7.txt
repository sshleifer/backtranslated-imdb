I suppose this movie will only work on people who were rejected by the giant exaggeration of The Lord of the Rings. Well, that's how it was. And so I love this movie. Especially I like all those impeccable LotR superheroes who are parodied in a perfect and disrespectful way. The brightest is the counterpart of Gandalf (the brave and wise and completely humorless magician of the know-it-all): Almghandi, the cowardice and the transvestite with brain death. The counterpart of Sauron ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) is using a simple bucket with holes for the eyes as a helmet. Aragorn's alter ego is another accident-prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ("Ulrike" the legend) with duct tape. And "Strunzdumm" (Wormtong's counterpart) in fact bears a strong resemblance to Brad Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
