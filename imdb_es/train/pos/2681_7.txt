['As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a prolific guy. Hes made hundreds and hundreds of movies, many of which are garbage. However, managed to sneak in an occasional quality work among all the operation of the assembly line. &quot;Succubus&quot; is not your best work (ie, &quot;The Diabolical Dr. Z&quot; or &quot;Vampyros Lesbos&quot;), but it has many of its registered trademarks that make it a must for anyone interested in immersing themselves in its large catalog. Combine the erotic (alternating between showing the frontal nudity and leave something to the imagination) and the surreal to perfection. This is a very dream movie, full of great atmosphere. I especially liked the constant call ropping. Despite looking incredibly pretentious, it is fun to listen to all the influences of Franco. <br /><br /> However, there are many users who do not like &quot;Succubus&quot; and I can see where they come from. It&#39;s paused, but I can deal with that. More problematic is incoherence. The script here was obviously rushed, and within five minutes of the film I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and never really joined from that moment). Those who want a substance with their style, look the other way. Also, if it&#39;s a horror movie, it never really becomes terrifying or even suspenseful. However, I was distracted by all the psychedelic stupidity that I did not really care about these important flaws. (7/10)']
