I love this episode of Columbo. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is in this and she's wonderful as the successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. It is delightful to see her as the cheerful and kind author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident. She blames her niece's husband, the nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge his death since the police have abandoned her. He would have loved someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I never like Hartley in anything personally. And, of course, with Columbo, there are some laughs like when he questions Veronica in a belly dance class. Ruth's Abigail is an intelligent detective and combines with the ingenuity that Columbo has always played wonderfully with Peter Falk.
