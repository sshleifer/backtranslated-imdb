['Walking with Cavemen, organized by Alec Baldwin, is a retrospective look at all the hominid species (it was us!) Of the last 5 million years: who they were, how they were and how they became extinct. Besides being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have about these species, Walking with Cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human. I waited several weeks to see this, and I was not disappointed.']
