This was amazing, which means it was hard to believe, that the "forgotten tribe" would make this amazing migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, did not organize some of the scenes and shots. But what shots are! The cinematography, mostly in extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the Iranian music added to the release of the video gives this memorable documentary an additional richness. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing this and "Kon Tiki" on the same weekend, it was exciting and certainly made me see how strong, resilient and courageous people can be, whether for the primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science.
