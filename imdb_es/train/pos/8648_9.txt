Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. A trip on the darkest road of all. The road of no return. The plot is about a couple who set out to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role so far) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have occurred in the United States and his girl, who is a photographer, is going to take the photographs. So they undertook a trail of famous murders without knowing what awaits them on the way. To share the travel expenses they decide to look for another couple and they place an advertisement. But the couple that responds is not just ANY couple. It is one of the strangest couples of all. The girl is a naive and fragile creature who dreams a lot and loves cacti. The man is the exact opposite. A cruel ruthless killer. We learn that at the beginning of the film and follow it throughout the trip to Kalifornia (not with C as usual, but with K, which presumably symbolizes the word murderer), throughout his journey of betrayal, murder and finally defeat . All the protagonists, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes give very good performances and we must bear in mind that when this movie was filmed, not one of them was a star. The photography is amazing, with the darkness covering the best parts of the film, and the music adapts to the dark character of the film. In general, this is a very good movie. Do not miss it You will think again before taking a stranger in your car to share the fuel!
