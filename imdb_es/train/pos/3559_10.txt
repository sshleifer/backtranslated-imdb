I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed. <br /> <br /> It's true that Frank Sinatra does not have the opportunity to sing so much in this movie, but it's also good that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie. where it is mainly he who sings. <br /> <br /> Actually I thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice, since he has the voice that fits and I could not see someone with this great voice taking out the gangster feeling. of his voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye "Sit, you're a Rockin 'the Boat" is a trick, a song that I always love. It is a difficult act to follow with your version and I still like your best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is excellent in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite of her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought that Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not have considered it first, but after seeing it in the part, it made sense. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. If I was being restated in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version, but this kept the feeling of the scenario. , even though I was in the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was well planned. I acted in regional versions of this and it is one of my favorites of that period.
