One is tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's film as an "event of thought" following the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal plot is a tortuous search by Bart Klever for that ephemeral substance that constitutes the essence of the personality. The script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination. This film-monologue originated as a response to Fellini's '8 Â½' and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Playing with enthusiasm with real and fictitious characters, as well as with the public, it reveals the capricious interconnection of the real and the imaginary, the paradoxical coexistence in two different galaxies: Guttenberg and MacLhuen. For some time we are willing to support the scriptwriter, who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the condemned stereotype of mass mentality ("man", "catholic", "window cleaner"). And together with it, we fall into a trap when the author-creator finally faces the insoluble dilemma: how can you eliminate it from the movie of the future? Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the end, thanks to the small common reproaches of the wife of the creator, who is deeply immersed in the work, we realize that together with the main character we have been "framed" again. Really, what is the price of art for which it is acceptable to give up one's name and the daily care of the young daughter? <br /> <br /> So, who is he, this Bart? Klever? Is it a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like Frenhoffer of Balzac's masterpiece (like the latter, the screenwriter at the end erases everything he has written from the computer's memory)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
