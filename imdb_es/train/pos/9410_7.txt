I enjoyed this movie. But I was surprised to see that people referred to her as a comedy. Sometimes it was fun, but in reality, it was not funny at all. If I had been expecting it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the movie, but, entering without expectations, I found it nice and engaging. Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less interested in the satire of capital or work, and more in the basic history of a man who fights for his invention. A man who is less interested in the monetary gain of his invention than in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. He is absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in exchange for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; I, I compare it with The Fountainhead.
