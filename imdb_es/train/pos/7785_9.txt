I just watched 2 movies of the Pang brothers, The Eye and One take only. When I saw The Eye, I was a little disappointed by these two guys, whom I had heard good words about before. That movie (The Eye) has a really bad script, especially the ending (childish, clich√© and too coincident in my opinion), but it is still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to watch One Take Only and I was not disappointed again. Still a great photograph, an impressive image, an MTV style edition, good music and this time, the story has a lot of indie, logical and beautiful spirit, you will see some small holes in the plot, but it does not cause any problems with the story. The only problem with this movie is that I have a bad DVD.
