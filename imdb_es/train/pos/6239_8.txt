A film / documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. Follow what they are doing and perhaps more what they are not doing. The rhythm is very calm ... so you have to relax ... breathe ... exhale before seeing it ........ <br /> <br /> First you think ... but nothing happens and you get a little upset about that ... and that's the problem, because it's the mood of the movie and the really nice social realistic images that are nice in this movie ... many people will say that It's disgusting ... but it's not so bad ... I think it's used more for marketing ... and there are some really funny moments ... a 60 old woman naked ... I guarantee you it's the most unpleasant striptease in the history of the cinema ... his film, which is real ... I think that's the word ... right in your face ... ... and that makes it a little scary. Here there is no manipulation of computers ... it's real life ... and as we all know, movies can beat reality when it comes to doing sick things ... ... so it's much worse in the world Real ....... <br /> <br /> If you survive the movie, you can start to look at your neighbors and think ... maybe they are like the people in you The movie ... I bet you there are many of them ... sick ... crazy living with a beautiful facade ... after watching the film I feel it is more interesting to look at my neighbors ........ <br /> <br /> But maybe you should not see this movie on your first date .........
