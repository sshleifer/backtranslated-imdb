If you like comedy cartoons for adults, like South Park, then this is almost a similar format about the little adventures of three teenagers at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina have given explosive sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories that happen with the teachers at the school. There's the idiot director, Mr. Bip, the nervous math teacher and many others. The cast is also fantastic, Gina Yashere from Lenny Henry, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Mark Perry from the dead Ringers and Nina Conti from Blunder. I did not know that this came from Canada, but it is very good. Very well!
