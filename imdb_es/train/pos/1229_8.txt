['I waited a long time before seeing this, since all the comments I read about this said it was horrible! I rented it expecting the worst, and although it&#39;s not Sandler&#39;s best movie, there are worse things! Sandler often speaks with the camera and the movie is not taken seriously, but that&#39;s part of the fun! An excellent way to miss an afternoon, and you may even find yourself laughing once twice! A good movie, it&#39;s worth renting!']
