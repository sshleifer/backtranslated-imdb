This is the best movie I've seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live a few miles from the town where the story happened, and I know how things work in this area in Sweden. The movie tells the truth, believe me! He criticizes and honors Dalarna's lifestyle, and the producer wants the people who watch the film to have a more open-minded mentality and to care more about their closest friends and family. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village Anywhere in Sweden (or another country) you will probably also recognize a lot of this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mar√≠a Blom!
