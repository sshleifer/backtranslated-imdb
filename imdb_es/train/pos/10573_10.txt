An excellent example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s. Audiences should be very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. A contrast of his "public enemy" 2 years ago. Cagney adds spark and interest to a plot and plot formulated, quite tired and routine. But the highlight of the film are the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back. First with the conservative number "Honeymoon Hotel", then followed by the spectacular and spectacular sequence "By A Waterfall", followed by the final sequence "Shanghai Lil", Cagney only participates in the last number that places it on top of a bar. Accountant with Ruby Keeler. The number "Shanghai Lil" with Cagney is excellent, but a little comedown and anti-climatic after the choreography "By A Waterfall" more exciting and incredibly amazing. If I were the director, I would have inserted the number "Shanghai Lil" in the middle and close with "By A Waterfall", which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water, so to speak and in my opinion, the best of the 3 numbers . The 3 production numbers are the icing on the cake and the performance of James Cagney is added to the decoration. An outstanding musical achievement, a 4 star movie, the best musical, it's worth seeing, you will not be disappointed !!!
