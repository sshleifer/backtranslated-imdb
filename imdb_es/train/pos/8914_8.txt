I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The city where Jerry's market was. I remember all my family going out to see the film. I remember a boy who showed me the "Blob" to me and my brothers in a bucket. I would also like to share that my mother was in the movie. Her hairstyle was the same as that of Aneta Corsaut and one night she was sick. They saw my mother and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for some shots from behind. They paid him $ 25.00 and gave him a story to tell until he died last August. My mother was not a teenager and I was a few months away from giving birth to my little sister.
