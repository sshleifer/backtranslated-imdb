['This movie has it all. Emotion, power, affection, the adorable nude dance on the beach by Stephane Rideau ... It exposes the need for true inner communion and external communication in any relationship. The fact that Cedric and Mathieu are a couple that turns out to be gay does not mean that there is not a very useful vision for anyone in it. I would probably classify it as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people, as well as homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieu&#39;s inability to manage his emotions reveals the way our society does not encourage us to act differently, and that is what breeds discord between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must see!']
