Mr. Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short films, that is, music videos, are simply the best. I do not care if I get a sensible sci-fi performance from this man, but I do care about a mix of his crazy dances, shouts, crowd choreography, and some fragments of CGI and animation. There should also be some uninterrupted videos. Everything I have mentioned is here. The stupid plot and the exaggerated "vanity fair" are not a problem when I witnessed Mr. Michael Jackson in action. For me, it will always be the last king of the music videos (not the "king of pop", which sounds stupid, especially for us, the Russians, because "pop" sounds like the Russian word for "asses" and MJ is definitely not the "king of asses"). I can see their best music videos again (they are artistically beautiful) and I never tire of them. <br /> <br /> My first impression of this movie was "What is this ...?" (fragments of different videos, some pictures drawn, disturbing jumps from one subject to another, absence of a cohesive plot line, some children playing, etc.) but as I saw it until the end, I could see that it was great and there really is not nothing as shown on television today. What I also like here is that it never shows any embarrassing material and children can easily see it. <br /> <br /> Without Mr. Michael Jackson, the universe of music videos would be quite poor. Even the best classic videos by other artists can not come close to the energetic hyperbole of MJ's musical madness and artistic quality. He knew how to reach the public of different ages and knew how to remain a man with moral principles. <br /> <br /> When I see a suitable DVD with the videos of Mr. Michael Jackson, I know it deserves to be bought. even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release. "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "Moonwalker" are great, although only "Moonwalker" is more like a movie (with a solid theme of "Smooth Criminal", theme of "paparazzi" and some strange parodies and turns)) . <br /> <br /> As I'm not a fan of MJ, I can still give this "movie ... like no other" a solid 9 out of 10 (I'm sure I was hit by "Smooth Criminal" and my main ones complaints are as follows: initial segments of the film could have fallen, while the main "MJ's anti-drug campaign" should have received more "madness and stress" and there should have been more "moonwalks," of course.). Thanks for your attention.
