I can not begin to describe how amazing this movie is. Suffice to say that, every time I'm depressed by how unfair or unfair things seem, this is the movie I'm going to rent to put me in the right frame of mind. The background music makes you realize the ease of existence and how simplicity provides the greatest happiness. The Indian girl who sings is just an example of a character in this film who does not try hard and, as a result, is happy. Persifina, Ruby's laundry companion (Ashley Judd) is another = her eyes and her smile could make the day of the person more difficult. I watch this movie and I dream of better days or a good conversation with friends, and I realize that being alone (Ruby is alone often) is not the same as being alone. Recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful break from a movie.
