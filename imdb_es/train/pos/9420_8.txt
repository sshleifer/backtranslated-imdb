The man in the white suit is one of those delicious comedies that the Ealing studios did so well in the 40s and 50s. The plot of this one follows a man who invents a cloth that does not get dirty or break. Of course, this is a breakthrough in the world of textiles. However, things are not so simple, as the fabric will threaten the lifestyle of many people, including the clothing manufacturers, the work forces of the fabric factory and even an old woman who washes her clothes every week. The man in the white suit is a film about scientific advances and how they do not always help; As the old woman says at one point in the movie: "Why can not scientists just leave things alone?" <br /> <br /> Like many Ealing comedies, this stars Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; has the ability to illuminate the screen with his presence (and he does in this film, literally), but also manages to portray his characters in a realistic and credible way. In this movie, it is appropriately spooky and captures the right atmosphere for your character; An intelligent and ambitious scientist, but somewhat naive. Along with Guinness, The Man in the White Suit also features Joan Greenwood, the deep-voiced actress who co-starred with Guinness in the simply divine "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would continue to get Alfred's role in the Batman movies. The acting in the film is not always great, but it's always decent, and it fits in with the movie. <br /> <br /> The man in the white suit is an intelligent comedy, thought provoking and witty with a moral. Comedy is not always obvious, and it does not always work, but the film is not meant to be a movie that provokes laughter, so it's forgivable. Basically, I recommend this movie to anyone who is a movie fan.
