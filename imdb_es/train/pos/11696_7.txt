"A Thief in the Night" is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans in general due to its low budget (which was obvious) and its theme: the Rapture of the true Christian church and the fate of those left behind . However, it was an exciting story that held the viewer and definitely made him review his relationship with Jesus Christ. He touched everyone, even showing a pastor who preached the Word, but he did not believe it, knowing exactly why he stayed behind. This movie, and its sequel "Distant Thunder", should be seen movies. Even with the launch of the new series "Left Behind", which tells the same story with a much higher budget, the impact remains the same: "A thief in the night" broke the base of this genre and will always be remembered.
