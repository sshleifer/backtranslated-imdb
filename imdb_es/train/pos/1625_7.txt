['A surprisingly good movie! It has enough good jokes throughout the entire movie. The only negative is that some scenes go to extremes to show how stupid the two main characters are. We got it, stupid blondes, keep going! <br /><br /> The plot barely dodges being called &quot;cheesy&quot;. And the piqueros are always an advantage, since the movie for some strange reason does not play with that card, although the plot presents two black-haired women who act as the evil part of our two blondes. <br /><br /> So, in general, a good movie to watch. I almost give it an 8/10, but let&#39;s not go crazy.']
