The talented detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his trip abroad to investigate a apparently cut and dry suicide case that he has good reason to suspect is something much more, a quite complex murder! <br /> <br /> As for murder mystery movies, there's nothing better than this. Full of suspicious characters, all connected to a dog show and all with very good reasons to kill the apparent victim of suicide, Archer Coe, it is really difficult to decipher it or to surround it with the head, but boy, is it fascinating to see it develop? before us. Even the police, the coroner and the district attorney are colorful, complete characters that add a level of harsh and unexpected realism to the procedures of this person and increase their "fun" factor in general. I particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), who always seems to be interrupted in a rude and inopportune way by the discovery of corpses or wounded men during his career. Also the detective sergeant Eugene Palette. Heath welcomes, often later, delightfully comical at his expense, critical comments during Vance's research. I can not think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact, except maybe it has not gone particularly well. However, it does not prevent the movie from simply being fun. Observe and see if you can wrap your head around the mystery of this. It is highly recommended that you try!
