I rented dominated by a whim, without even knowing that it was inspired by a real story, and although it is the least probable and true biographical film that you will probably see. I found it quite amazing. <br /> <br /> While Richard Kelly was writing, he put together a mass of arguments and stories in 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it more than once, you get it and you appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a bounty hunter model who abandons Hollywood's perfect life to pursue a not-so-subtle or perfect career. It has an avant-garde style of travel provided by the director Tony Scott. And with music and fast-paced editing, it provides visual brilliance to keep your attention, with witty presentations and an unexpected comedy, the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours.
