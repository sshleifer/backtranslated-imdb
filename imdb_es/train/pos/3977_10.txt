I personally saw this to see the images of the 60s and 70s. It was fascinating to know how the drug movement essentially began and became pop culture and an eventual intransigent force in life. The interviews of classic rock stars are exciting and humorous. You feel like you're in a secret and nodding at the same time ... because it feels so good and familiar. I loved it, all the segments from the 60s to the present. I highly recommend it for all aspects, including rock music, the hipper movement, politics and good history. Check the box marked that says it contains a spoiler, just because I have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regard, since I discussed what is in the 4 segments, so I just wanted to be sure.
