There's an old saying that relates to Joe Johnston's new movie that goes something like this: "The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can not be right". That is a very presumptuous statement that refers to self-motivation and belief in an individual, which, in this film, is true even after obstacles and family problems get in the way. <br /> <br /> The "October sky" is about a young man who believes in himself called Homer Hickam, who grew up in a strict and traditional family in the fifties. Homer loves in a small coal mining town where almost all men grow up to be miners. All his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's. Homer does not get excited about that future. <br /> <br /> One night, while everyone looks at the sky, a Russian spacecraft called Sputnik passes over. This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this moment, your aspect of life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the area of ​​rocket scientists for an occupation. Surprised by what he says, his family passes the idea over their heads and continues with the usual life. However, his friends think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very intelligent individual when it comes to this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When the four friends start to try model rockets, and blow up a white picket fence for the smithereens, then what seems to be a forest fire frightens them, they are forced to finish their progress. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie are absolutely fascinating from start to finish. All actors give representations as if this were the real mumbo jumbo here. Standing out in all the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This may very well be Academy Award material if the judges can remember the beginning of the year when this movie is released. <br /> <br /> The characters are also extremely well developed. Not only do the filmmakers give a clear and apparent reason for why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their rocketry studies. We clearly understand all the motives and beliefs of the characters, especially the father, who is committed to the eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> The movie, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum at the midpoint due to nonsense. , a recycled romantic subplot that involves Homer's love interest and how his brother stole it. This kind of thing is becoming so terribly common in high school movies, not that this movie is aimed at high school students. The actors look at each other without thinking, as if they were in a trance. I endured it without complaining about "Inventing the Abbots" of 1997, but I've had enough with this. <br /> <br /> But that's just a minor complaint. With an authentic period of time, the cinematography is worth an Oscar and the clips from real life Homer and his friends at the end, all of whom triumphed in their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999. <br /> <br />
