I feel a little protective with this film because it was my introduction to the verse of the U.N.C.L.E. The year was 1972, and I.T.V. He performed all eight roles in a bumper race (followed by reruns of 'The Persuaders' starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore) on Saturday nights. 'The Karate Killers' was chosen to open the season. It started with a great action sequence when Solo and Kuryakin's sports car was attacked by a squad of mini THRUSH helicopters. I was a lifelong fan from that moment on. <br /> <br /> After the main credits (it's good to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing action images) we go to the lab of Dr.. Simon True (Jim Boles), inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater. True's wife, Amanda (Joan Crawford), had an affair with THRUSH's agent, Randolph (Herbert Lom). A ruthless guy, in fact, kills both the doctor and his wife, before looking for the formula. True prepared for the event: he divided it into five segments, each written in a photograph of himself, and sent it to his five daughters, all scattered all over the world. <br /> <br /> Solo and Kuryakin set out to get the formula first, which led to a series of episodes in different locations, and appeared from people like Telly Savalas (like an Italian Count with closed fists), Terry- Thomas and Curt Jurgens. One of Dr. True's daughters, Sandy (Kim Darby), accompanies the U.N.C.L.E. boys in their global search. <br /> <br /> Having assembled the formula, THRUSH appears and delivers them, before taking them to their secret base at the North Pole ... <br /> <br /> Of all the taco feature films, this is the which I think should have been produced especially for the cinema. It hurts to be a television product, even if it is one more expensive than normal. No filming was done at the site, and the various segments appear as repetitive, usually culminating in a cut between U.N.C.L.E. and thunder. From the cast, Joan Crawford is memorably hammy in her small role, and Curt Jurgens is misinformed as a sugar daddy. As a London fan, Terry-Thomas is as charming as ever, and Herbert Lom is as good as the main villain. Kim Darby laughs though as 'Sandy'. I should have told him to stay at home. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing about this is that it manages to be more fun and entertaining than many of the official movie premieres of the time, including "In Like Flint". Casino Royale 'and' The Ambushers'. I would love to know how Solo and company escaped from THRUSH H.Q. after the death of Randolph however.
