He will be forgiven for thinking that a Finnish director from Helsinki would not be good at directing a US horror film (especially one that is completely inside a US prison). See this to prove you're wrong! After all, it occurred in the 80s and the film was made with a more suitable budget for a television commercial from a modern DIY company (something that I think anyone would really notice today, since virtually everyone is accustomed to the budgets of more than $ 100 million for action movies that dominate the industry!) being Mr. Harlin's first major production and, at least what today would be considered a star cast. I still think that most of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole has more to do with the screen appearances of Stellan Stargaard (not to mention the efforts of director Bergman, very overrated), at least for all the viewers, but This movie really proves that there is a suitable cinematographic talent outside the USA. UU and Hollywood to make us watch a movie in suspense. Try to watch this movie even if it is not a breath of horror, IMO is definitely worth it!
