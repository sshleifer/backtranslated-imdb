I still wonder why I saw this movie. It is true that, before watching this movie, I knew practically nothing about the beatles. I did not even know all their names! All he knew was that they had a lot of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the best in history, they split up, John got married to Yoko Ono and John was killed. <br /> <br /> Also, VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another, I decided to look at it, without expecting much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight messy accent. This is very important, since John and Paul talking are practically the whole movie, although it takes them outside to explore more possibilities and keep looking. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good results, in general. <br /> <br /> The ending was also very smart. I enjoyed how the film excited him with the performance of the SNL, and then he slapped him in the head and made him realize that it would be better to let him pass and finish with a good grade. My favorite moment is probably the touching scene of the roof. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. It is a very good way to resolve your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the breakup, Paul simply appeared at John's door. This is probably the main reason why I watched this movie, establishing my curiosity about who the Beatles really were and what might have happened to them after the break.
