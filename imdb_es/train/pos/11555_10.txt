A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... this is a wonderful movie that I can watch over and over again. It is definitely one of the ten best comedies made. With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau write a perfect script for Neil Simon, based on his work. <br /> <br /> It's a real and perfect situation. If you have a digital cable, you get the menu at the bottom of the screen to show what is on. It usually gives this movie *** stars, but it really deserves **** stars. If you really see this movie, you can say it will be so fun and fresh in a hundred years.
