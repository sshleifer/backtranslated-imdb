Gender Bender the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out that 'it' is both. <br /> <br /> Sleeping in mud <br /> <br /> Then everyone left <br /> <br /> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great episode of season 1. I enjoy this because the story is the kind where you're never really sure what will happen next. It is completely original. The teaser is very fun with the approach of the eye and the reflection of the lights of the disco. I really need to learn my trick with the thumb that the gender teacher does. I really like the atmosphere in the small town of Kindred and Mulder and Scully hide in the middle of the night. It's very exciting. This is one of my favorite episodes of season 1 in fact. I think what I like most about this is how they turn out to be extraterrestrials at the end and leave crop circles. Many people see this as an alien episode unrelated to mythology, such as "The Unnatural" or "Space", but I think this could easily be seen as related to mythology. Perhaps the master of the genre was like the extraterrestrial bounty hunter and could look like any character. Eh Anyway, I give the episode a 9 out of 10.
