Not that many movies have really exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have. Those in the profession have some instruments that look really intimidating. Give the writers Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon and Charles Finch for maximum impact from where they feel they are twisting in their seats. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen, in a nicely nuanced presentation, is Alan Feinstone, a dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the tracks from the start. An unbalanced obsessive-compulsive, begins to think of decadence, even to imagine where there is none, and to compare the decline with the corruption of society in general. Having witnessed his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) doing it with his pool boy, he decides to punish her. At the same time, it is under the pressure of an elegant I.R.S. agent (Earl Boen, better known as Dr. Silberman of the "Terminator" franchise) to do a favor in exchange for the agent saying nothing about Feinstone's financial affairs. Feinstone begins to perceive everyone around him as broken in one way or another, and continues with a wave of murders while police detective Gibbs (the always welcome Ken Foree) follows his trail. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna clearly has a lot of fun with the script. It allows for some genuinely unpleasant and remarkably entertaining gore scenes that do as well as create sympathy for the victims as exciting the audience. The script gives the Feinstone character some fine lines of dialogue and, in general, is quite cunning and funny, with a great deal of black-hued humor (such as Feinstone ordering a victim to "take his tongue out of the way!") . Brooke and the I.R.S. Agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes. The makeup effects are for the most part quite good. And the film does a good job of maintaining its momentum forward, as Feinstone, with his relentless drive to perfection, changes from respected professional to deranged killer in record time. <br /> <br /> Foree, always great and fun to watch, is a waste of a standard detective role, but there's some pleasure in watching Boen play his thin-ball role until the end. Hoffman and Christa Sauls provide very attractive treats. And a Mark Ruffalo prior to fame can be seen in a small supporting role. But all this is much more than Bernsen's show when he sinks his teeth (forgive me for using that expression) in his main role with total conviction. <br /> <br /> "The dentist" ranks as one of the most original and interesting horror films that will come out of the 90s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
