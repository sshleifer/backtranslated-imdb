This is an adventure yarn that ripsnorting, old-fashioned. I understand that by today's political standards, the treatment of the Indians was unacceptable. But this movement is not about politics. It's about action, dialogue, camaraderie, acting, directing, music and photography, and it's wonderful in all of these factors. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are electric together, and Jaffe is excellent. This is the best movie of friends.
