I love it when they actually do a good sports story. So many in the past have been so bad that it was embarrassing to see them. This not. It's just a really nice movie, a kind of old-fashioned story, and based on a real-life guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays a high school coach who is told to try, at the end of his life athletically speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, it reaches its goal of reaching the Major Leagues, even if it was a very short period. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are nice people, the kind you support, from Quaid to the players on their high school team, to their little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a star on television ). <br /> <br /> Quaid is credible in playing Jim Morris because, unlike the actors of the sport in the past Movies, he knows how to throw a baseball. It looks like a pitcher, a guy who could shoot more than 90 miles per hour. And, most of this movie is true, as demonstrated by the real-life pitcher in one of the documentaries on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you are looking for a nice and inspiring movie from real life sports, you can not go wrong with this one.
