I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as good as they were, nor did I expect them to perform in a well-developed artistic film, with enough plot to keep you interested and with enough diversity to make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I'll be attentive to the next movie like this one. I especially like the fact that it's a vampire movie, but it was not a corny vampire movie, nor did it embellish it. All the characters had human traits. The way he shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it really makes you feel sorry for them throughout their lives. I give this movie two thumbs up. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the last five years.
