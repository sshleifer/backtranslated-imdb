Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Carrey. Although I admit that I have not seen all his movies * cough * magic * cough *. Bruce Almighty was nice. None of the other reviews really has analyzed how corny it is toward the end, I do not know what the writers thought. Somehow, I could not help feeling that this movie was a bad attempt to recreate Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Steve Correl, of The Daily Show, is HILARO and the rest of the cast. Look at Bruce Almighty if you're a big fan of Jim Carrey, or if you just want to see a somewhat funny comedy (that soft for piano).
