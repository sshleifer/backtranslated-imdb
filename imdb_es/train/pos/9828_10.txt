I'll be honest with you ... I liked this movie. It is an excellent movie for zombies that is full of action, original ideas, good acting, but it is also full of bad effects of zombies. Part IV, entitled "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this movie to terror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this should visit Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full movies Moon Pictures.
