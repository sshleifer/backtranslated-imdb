"La madre" is a strange, low-budget film that touches at least two uncomfortable subjects that are not usually explored in the cinema: the denial of the mother's love for her own son and daughter, and the lust and passion in the third age. <br /> <br /> The characters are terrible: May is a disgusting old woman and I think it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or pity for her. She confesses that she did not love her son or her daughter. She cheated on her husband twice with an intellectual. She steals her daughter's beloved man, not to protect her from a man without morals, who does not love her, but only because she feels horny with him. She is trying to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter's deceptions. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser, who accepts her life as it is. His brother Bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife, who insists on having his store, a terrible business. Darren is an imbecile addicted to love that nobody likes, not even himself. <br /> <br /> The acting and the direction are excellent: the actresses and the actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very precise. I liked this movie, but I recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
