A big surprise, probably because I expected it to stink. The critics discarded it enough, although all seemed to agree that the concept was golden: a man discovers that his new girlfriend is a super hero, and discovers that when he wants to break up with her, it is as if he were a great hero. psychopath. I kept waiting for it to fall apart, but in reality it never did. Of course, it does not do as much of its incredible premise as it could, and chooses to be brief when it could have been better to expand the universe of the film. But I can not blame him for that. Uma Thurman is great as the bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And I discovered, after several years of displeasing him, that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when he presents himself as a club. He has given two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other in the practically unpublished Idiocracy). I absolutely broke the expressions on his face when he and Thurman had sex for the first time. It's one of the funniest sex scenes in history. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a little psychic, almost unbelievably. Maybe with some background I could have accepted it better. However, I can forgive his faults because I had a great time watching him. Underestimated, sure.
