I love this show as it is full of adventure, love and intrigue. Well, sometimes love! It's so good to see a show where all the characters work well together and treat each other with respect. It is also very good to see Dick Van Dyke in a television role, since I have only seen him in Mary Poppins. The mix of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve is very captivating to the audience. This is a show you have to see!
