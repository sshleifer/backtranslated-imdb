['Speaking of a grand opening, &quot;Infernal Trap&quot; has the best opening credits in history. Guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary theme &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the main players appear on the screen divided into giant syllables. The promising introduction of a totally obscure and dark wood / woodblock survival thriller becomes colder with each passing minute. Two extremely competitive and overstretched paintball enemies of testosterone challenge each other to the ultimate confrontation in a bar of poor quality. According to an article in the newspaper, there is a wild bear loose in nearby forests and already killed several of the hunters who tried to catch him. The challenge includes that who kills the bear will be declared the ultimate male hero with the biggest ball game. However, upon arrival, it quickly becomes evident that they do not face a bear, but a bewildered and absolutely manic war veteran with a large arsenal of weapons in their hiding place and numerous combat tricks up their sleeve. After a decade of American nuances and derivatives, this Mexican effort of the early 90&#39;s looks and feels very refreshing and vivid. The formula is simplistic but efficient, the main characters are plausible enough and the development of the confrontations with the sadistic murderer is reasonably suspenseful. The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, since he also wears a self-made glove with sharp knives and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are pleasantly unpleasant and barbarous, which I really expected from the incredible opening sequences mentioned above, and wasted a lot of free blood. The forest environment and especially the camouflaged traps are gleefully spectacular. &quot;Internal Trap&quot; is a Mexican slasher / survival success that is strongly recommended to fans of the genre.']
