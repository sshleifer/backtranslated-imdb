I was very impressed by this movie. The writing was fantastic, and all the characters were rich and simple. It is very easy to relate emotionally with all of them. The creators of this movie really hit the nail on the head when it comes to creating real life characters, and making the viewer be absorbed by their world. Also, the music is great. They employed some independents to make the score, and part of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie. If you have the opportunity to see this movie in a small theater or a film festival (as I did), I recommend you go see it. Also, on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's enough reason to go see it.
