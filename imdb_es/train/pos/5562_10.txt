This has the funnista jokes of all the films of Cheech and Chong. It's the first one I saw with these guys. I thought it was very good My dad really recommended that I get it. WHAT IS A MODEL OF GREAT PAPER, and my GRANDMA really bought it for me, knowing how it was. What family do I have? Well, this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic. I must warn you, however, this is not very fun. It has its moments, but not as funny as "There Something About Mary". Take a look anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless you're an anti-drug activist or something.
