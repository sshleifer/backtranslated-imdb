In another of Bugs Bunny's shorts, the famous leporid * works in a showcase of a department store, when the owner Gildersleeve decides to cram it. Of course, this is almost impossible, since apparently Bugs knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and knows when to dress cross). As always, they make everything come at maximum speed, and, therefore, you have to wonder how hilarious this caricature must have looked when it first debuted! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a good example of how the Looney Tunes looked in the 40s before the Termite Terrace crowd polished them. But do not get me wrong, the cartoons were still very good after the refined forms arrived. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an excellent one. <br /> <br /> * Leporids are rabbits and hares.
