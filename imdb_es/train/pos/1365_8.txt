I'm-hello! This is a very funny movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have a New York girl from the early 90s, independent of fun and love. Together with her friends from the party, she meets a mature Turkish salesman. It's a story that comes of age for those new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It's comforting to see a lazy woman become a mature woman. Hope is given to all the bums we can feel that their only skills are able to maintain while they are hammered and are not enough to organize happy holidays. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie great. I've never been a big fan of her, but this movie makes me want to see all her movies. There are subtle mannerisms that perfected his character. If you want good laughs and a fun time, make sure you watch this movie. Repeated visits are a must.
