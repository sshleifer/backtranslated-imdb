['Writing something genuine and true is a challenge. Knowing how to shoot and arm it without making it trivial is even better. Ishai Setton&#39;s film is one of those in which Life can be recognized in all its simplicity and beauty. I have played &quot;The big bad Swim&quot; and, from now on, I will promote it as much as I can. It&#39;s a pity that I can not show my friends something (you know, like a DVD?), Because talking is good ... but giving something to do is better. Everyone can not go to festivals to discover pearls like that and this movie is worth putting it there! Thank you very much to the staff of this masterpiece, and I am waiting for it to be distributed.']
