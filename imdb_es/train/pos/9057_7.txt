Let's be simple: my two children were glued to this movie. It has its flaws from an adult perspective, but buy some gelatin worms and just enjoy it. <br /> <br /> And the Pepsi girl was excellent! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was very good, although not much in the movie, so do not get too excited. . <br /> <br /> It's not that it's really bad, but it's the kind of movie you see only once. Do not buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for the parents).
