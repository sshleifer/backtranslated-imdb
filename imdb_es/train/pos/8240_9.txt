I was also present at the premiere in Toronto. This movie was a kind of consolation when I thought I could not go in to see my first choice. Well, I was totally impressed. When I arrived at the theater I could not remember anything other than the basic plot of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who was in it). Great performances by the whole cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true abandonment of her days as Trinidad. As for Billy Connolly, I think not, since Chaplin has an actor played as brilliantly and without lines as ever. The children were great too. Definitely, check this one if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> And, by the way, I could see my first option anyway, and this was much better.
