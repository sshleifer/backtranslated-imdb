['I just started watching the TV series &quot;What I like about you&quot; and I must say it&#39;s a pleasure to watch it. I always like to see new programs go well, since many of them leave before they really feel well. I have seen Amanda Bynes from &quot;All That&quot;, she is really a funny girl, the best thing about her comedy is that it is so natural and what I want to say is that it is something that a person could say, like her best friend, is not rehearsed <br /><br /> I recently started watching the show and I fell in love. I&#39;m just watching reruns from now, but I&#39;m looking forward to next season. All the characters in the show give something to the whole story line. It&#39;s nice to see some old faces from other shows I enjoyed watching in the past, like Jennie Garth from &quot;90210&quot;, Leslie Grossman from &quot;Popular&quot; and Wesley Jonathan from &quot;City Guys&quot;. The new character is also very talented, Nick Zano has that charm that makes you love him even when he is doing something wrong for holly (Bynes). <br /><br /> In general, this show has the right ingredients to succeed, I hope to see it grow.']
