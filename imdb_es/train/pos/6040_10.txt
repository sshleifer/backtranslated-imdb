I just never get tired of seeing FREEBIRD. My husband was an extra, so I was involved from the beginning. I have kept in touch with Jon and he has helped to promote the film both in theaters and in the DVD release. Even to the extent of distributing promotional postcards in cross-channel ferries and in several places in France. FREEBIRD was written and directed by experts with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus the select cast. Only Phil Daniels could fit into the role of Grouch. Great privilege to meet Jon and the cast at the party after the premiere in January. Anything else you want to do, Jon, just ask, either by email or phone, you know how to contact me. Sue xx
