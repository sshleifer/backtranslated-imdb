Having seen Charley Boorman on Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested to see how Charley would be on his own show. I thought Charley met a charming guy who is very grounded. It's good to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and physical condition, they also show their human being! I do not know much about bicycles, but this show captivated me from the beginning. The preparation and organization of this event seems immense. The event itself seems very dangerous and it fascinates me to see why Charley and everyone else is doing it and how far it goes. I love the rhythm of the show and the happy and fast music. I can not believe my clavicle is broken, I really hope it's not the end, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
