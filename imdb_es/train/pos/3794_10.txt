`Our Song 'gives us the life of the three teenagers Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn, the best friends who hang at the end of summer. Teenagers' summer, even if we do not know the signs and landmarks of this particular land, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, is the same for all of us. A lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of the school. Welcome warmth and idleness. <br /> <br /> But if this experience of adolescence is universal, the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know, maybe a country as foreign as any other. Young bodies carving new silhouettes ... calling a new territory ... the labyrinth towards adulthood. The young mind enters itself, speaking for itself, saying that this is what I am, this is what I want to try to be. It is / was always like that. But this is how it develops in Brooklyn in the late 90s. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is the writer / director of this film project, but he recognizes everyone who has shouted suggestions. The opening title slide "A movie of" seems to list everyone in the universe. It's a gesture, but at the end of the movie, we know it's genuine. [The closing titles also have some of the most valuable and appreciated credits I've read.] The recording of the vivid sound of Jan McLaughlin deserves special attention. McKay is a modest leader who knows who is telling this story; His three thanks are Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They are the real, their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality. This is not a music video of teenage life. He has the seriousness of the long look without blinking. <br /> <br /> Hanging with them, we do not feel included, but we feel privileged to listen to them. They are real voices that speak clearly about the crisis. and the dullness of everyday life. We are witnesses to the modern mathematics of adolescent life: how its problems are interpreted, calculated, summarized and resolved. Small scenes illustrate great thoughts throughout. Lanisha hangs with her dad in her security job, it's the only way she can spend time with him. We see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood. In a connected scene, Lanisha defends her father before her mother, and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and that they love her in return. Later, the three friends lie in the dark sharing visions and dreams, and we remember how crazy and fun children are and, what is more tragic, how realism strikes idealism these days. And in the end, Maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself. We see her gather the courage to keep all her fears and doubts at bay. She demonstrates for us the strength that one needs to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable. <br /> <br /> `The greatest gift of our song is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship: how, One day, alive and animated, that intimacy can, in the next, simply turn around and move away. It's horrible, but that's right, is not it?
