Unfortunately, this movie never reached DVD. I saw it when it was first released in theaters in 1983, and then again when VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a copy of VHS at a flea market, I bought it immediately. I was not disappointed. First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and it is a pleasure to contemplate her. But then, the film takes you to an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The film is about many things. It is about how the World Bank and the big corporations exploit and enslave the developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt they can never pay. It's about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us to get into debt with credit cards, mortgages and car payments. It's about trying to save an innocence that maybe we've never really had and maybe we really can not save. It is about good and evil and how difficult it is sometimes to say one of the other. It raises many questions but does not give answers. I think sometimes this is good. For this reason, this is a movie that is really worth saving and watching.
