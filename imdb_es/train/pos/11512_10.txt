When originally screened in the United States in 1972, 'The Night Stalker' became the best rated for T.V. Film in history. Based on the unpublished novel by Jeff Rice, he told how an intrepid investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak (the late Darren McGavin) discovered the existence of a vampire in the current city of Las Vegas. When it came to British television four years later, it did not have the same impact, but my friends talked about it at school on Monday morning, just like me. We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things. I had seen. <br /> <br /> I did not know of the existence of 'The Night Strangler' until it appeared almost a decade later. I.T.V., who screened 'Kolchak' films, had apparently decided to broadcast the spin-off series; they felt that 'Barnaby Jones', starring Buddy Ebsen, was more of a draw, and anyway, viewers might confuse 'Kolchak' with 'Kojak'! For years, my only source of information about the program was an article in the Fangoria magazine. I could not even buy Jeff Rice's novels. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 published the program as part of a Friday night series dedicated to the supernatural called "Mystery Train," presented by Richard O'Brian. 'Kolchak' found himself rubbing his shoulders with people like 'The Brain Eaters' and 'Earth Vs.The Spider'. The initial titles were cut, eliminating the Kolchak whistles and the final credits ... well, there were none. <br /> <br /> The first episode planned was 'Werewolf'. I can not say I was too impressed, but I kept that, and I'm glad I did! <br /> <br /> I really wish I had seen him in 1974. My twelve-year-old self would have adored him. Spooky, funny, exciting, it's no wonder that it triggered Chris Carter's imagination. <br /> <br /> The biggest asset of the program was, of course, McGavin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was a figure of an ordinary man, eccentrically dressed, quite conservative. It was for the supernatural what 'Columbo' was for the crime. The late Simon Oakland was also great as the bad temper of Kolchak, Tony Vincenzo. The scripts overflowed with a wonderful dry wit. I found myself enjoying the program more because of the humor content than because of the horror. When the twenty episodes ended, I felt deprived. <br /> <br /> 'The X-Files' appeared a few years later and filled the gap, but only up to a point. I wanted Kolchak and Vincenzo to come back. I'm glad that the show was never revived though. Without Oakland it would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I have Rice's books now and have read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King programmed the first one (in his book 'Danse Macabre'), since it is as good as everything he has written. <br /> <br /> Alright, then some of the monsters were not very modern, but so what? The new 'Kolchak' completely lost the point of the original. What you do not see is sometimes more frightening than what you do ... <br /> <br /> Best Episode - 'The worst episode of Horror In The Heights' - 'The Sentry'
