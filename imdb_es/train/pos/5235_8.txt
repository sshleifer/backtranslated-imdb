The plot does not begin to describe the film: a man is writing a movie or, rather, * this * movie. It is totally self-referential to the point where you think it will bend over itself like a black hole. The writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and he writes about it. <br /> <br /> It is very philosophical, like "The waking life", but more oriented to Zen and, in fact, much better, in my opinion. At one point, there are interviews with people on the street and then you see pictures of these people who are being filmed, and then you find out that their answers are written in a script when you keep changing their lines. There are beautiful landscapes and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it comes out on DVD so I can see it more carefully. Seen at Cinequest (the San Jose Film Festival, CA) on 02/25/2002.
