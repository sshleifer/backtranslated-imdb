Excellent film that deals with the life of an old man while looking back through the years. As of 1910, he remembers his son and his youth; your family, friends, romances, etc. A very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet ending ... "all the things of life come together as one, and a river passes through it, and that river pursues me". Worth seeing.
