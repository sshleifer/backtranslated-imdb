I saw this movie on True Movies (which automatically made me skeptical) but it was actually good. Why? Not because of the incredible twists of the plot or the impressive dialogue (of which there is little), but because in reality, despite what people say, I thought that the film was accurate in its representation of teenagers who deal with pregnancy . <br /> <br /> It's NOT Dawson's Creek, it's not funny, genius and witty characters who go through sexuality with effortless knowledge. They are children and act as children would. <br /> <br /> They are blunt, clumsy and annoying above all. Yes, this could be by accident and they could be bad actors, but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when he does not try to be cool) a very credible performance and I loved him for that. Patricia Arquette is weepy and annoying, but was she pregnant and a teenager? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was VERY predictable and but so what? I believed them, their stress and their inability to cope with them, their courageous attempts, although somewhat misguided, to bring them closer. I think that the characters, played by any other person, SHOULD have been annoying and incredible but they were not. It reflects the surreality of the situation in which they find themselves, that he is sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby. I was angry with her for that, I got angry with him for being such a child and for blaming her. I felt everything. <br /> <br /> In the end, I loved it and I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> Look out for the scene in which Dermot Mulroney flees from the disastrous counseling session: professional performance.
