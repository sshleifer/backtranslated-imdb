I have not seen each and every one of Chan's films, but this is undoubtedly the best I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The story itself is not really special, so I will not. Do not go deeper into that. What makes it special are the tricks, the fights, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. The movie has a violent rhythm until the end and you are stunned to see it. All the great tricks (of course done by Jackie himself) make you want to jump on the couch and scream. It is simply amazing! Even my mother was impressed by this great movie when she saw it. <br /> <br /> I know that this history of the police can be a bit hard to get, at least it's here in Sweden. But I can assure you it's worth a try.
