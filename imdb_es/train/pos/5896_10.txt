A really great movie and a real story. Dan Jansen, the best skater of all time. A moving and beautiful film that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens fights cancer and Dan Jansen loves his sister. Of an important promise made by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove that his sister Jane was right in believing that his talent in speed skating was justified. This photo is worth the time. I would like you to make more movies of this quality. Thanks for a great movie with excellent actors and an excellent story. It is a very moving story about the beautiful family support and faith for your children and a special dream for your youngest child and your sister.
