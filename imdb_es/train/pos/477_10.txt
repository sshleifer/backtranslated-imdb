Hello, I am a chess enthusiast since I was 6 years old. I guess I'm pretty obsessed with chess, but I hope it's not as much as the central character in this movie. <br /> <br /> In this film, the central character reflects a true chess player named Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where Steinitz played a beautiful combination. Instead of quitting, he simply left the tournament room, never to return. <br /> <br /> The social ineptitude of the central character is, unfortunately, a delight of some of the most serious grandmasters that you sometimes get in chess tournaments. Chess, I suppose, is a very big sacrifice, and sometimes you can end up unbalanced in other areas of life. An important example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although he was a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways. <br /> <br /> In the film, a game is represented by the world championship, between a great Italian master and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which in reality Fide's world governing body has sometimes employed as a format in itself, ranging from 128 players to only 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout, which also shows a realistic format, where the winners of each group play with each other. <br /> <br /> The position before the suspension makes the chess puzzle fascinating in itself. In fact, I've made a YouTube video about it so you can explore the winning combination in detail, enjoy it! http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes, Tryfon
