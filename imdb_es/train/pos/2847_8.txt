As is generally known, anthology films do not work very well with the American public (I guess they prefer a standard plot). New York, I Love You, is the second phase of a series of anthology films about cities and the people who live and love in them. The first was 'Paris, J'Taime', which I really enjoyed. The film was composed of several segments, each written and / or directed by a different director (most of which were French, but there is a very fun segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like 'Paris', this is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.) and also as' Paris'deals with New Yorkers, and why they love it the city in which they live. It has a first-rate cast, with artists such as Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki and experienced veterans such as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly, and some do not (although I guess it will depend on individual tastes, I will not ruin anyone else by revealing which ones worked for me and which ones did not). The news is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece out of the question?). Spoken mainly in English, but has fragments of Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. 'R' rating by the MPAA for strong language and sexual content
