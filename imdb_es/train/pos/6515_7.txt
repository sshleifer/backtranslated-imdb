I almost did not rent it because of all the bad comments, but I did it anyway. I thought it was similar to the falls of darkness, which I also liked. The only part I hated about the tooth ferry were the two red-necked brothers at the gas station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but this was not a comedy. He ruined the film a bit for me because it was unnecessary. The rest of the movie was like it should be a horror or suspense movie. The makeup was good and I've seen much worse movies than this one. It was a simple story with a credible performance. It is not the most terrifying or terrible movie, but I did not get angry or wanted a refund after seeing it. In the DVD there were previews of other movies that look good and I'll see them.
