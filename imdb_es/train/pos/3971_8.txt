<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt like you were being watched, as if someone was aware of every movement you make? Well, remember that before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least that's the feeling you have after seeing the exciting but slightly bland criminal drama, the history of the FBI. It traces the roots of the organization from a small office to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959), telling the story through the eyes of one of its agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> <br /> Chip was with the FBI from the first day, and he gladly puts his work above everyone, even from time to time to his family. The history of the FBI tracks his life describing what he does as an agent and how being one affects his personal life. The film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the FBI handles and how they handle them. The audience can watch Chip stop the Ku Klux Klan riots, go undercover to solve an assassination scandal / Indian heritage, put the fugitives in custody, rescue hostages and help fight in World War II. He even helped bring the Communist spies to justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart, in a vaguely complex performance, is stellar (as always) as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job, maybe too much. One of the best parts of this movie is that we can see the inner workings of Chip's family life and his work. We witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son. We also observed that his wife had a miscarriage, and their marriage had difficult times. Almost all of your personal problems are caused by the love of your work. Vera Miles gives an irregular performance, but it is very convincing, however. She was never a brilliant actress, but there was always something very attractive and attractive about her. Well, maybe that's just me? Unfortunately, it is not worth mentioning any of the other presentations, but the story that caught my attention kept me extremely interested. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of this film was impressive, especially the scenes in the South American jungles. All the colors had a texture that really set the mood of the film. Perhaps the best part of this movie was the fabulous address of Mervyn Leroy. Each scene was so fluid that they simply shot together to tell a brilliant story. It is full of ingenious camera shots, some with a very Hitchcockian feel. <br /> <br /> In general, The FBI Story is a spectacular movie, but overlooked. Arriving at two and a half hours, some spectators may feel intimidated, but if you have the opportunity, I recommend that you throw yourself into this. I enjoyed the spectacular performance of Jimmy Stewart and the captivating story.
