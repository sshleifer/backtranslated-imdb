I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma". I've seen her many times and I'm always looking forward to seeing her again. Although it only lasted 107 minutes, most of the novel's plots and subplots developed satisfactorily. . All the characters are well portrayed. Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel without silly jokes added as in Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors. The stage and the costumes were beautiful. I think this version is quite on par with the 1995 miniseries "Pride and Prejudice," but the producer and the screenwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a very good job of portraying "Emma", of whom Jane Austen said she would create a heroine that no one else would love. She is snobby, but she has enough youth and inexperience to remain pleasant. Mark Strong was also very good at playing Mr. Knightley, it's not an easy part, I think, even though he does not have the charisma shown by Mr. Darcy of Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice. Even the final scene (the harvest festival) that does not occur in the novel provides an appropriate ending, except when Emma is shown being cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill, while in the novel she completely reconciled with him, even telling him That she would have enjoyed duplicity, if she had been in her situation. A strange deviation from the fidelity that is shown throughout the film. I find the most beautiful and elaborate costumes than in other adaptations of Jane Austen's novels.
