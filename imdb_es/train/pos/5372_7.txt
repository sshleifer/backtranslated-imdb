Of the first five episodes of Hammer's "Hammer House of Horror" series, this fifth episode with the wonderful title "The House That Bled to Death" is possibly the most spooky. As a big fan of gothic horror films from Hammer Studios for many years, I wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series recently. So far, I've only seen the first five episodes, and I have the strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the series is still as entertaining as the first five episodes are, I'll be satisfied. While the second and third episodes were great for observing their morbid and witty dark sense of humor, this fifth entry is, without a doubt, one of the first five that offers the most genuine Horror. The episode begins when an old man murders his wife for unknown reasons. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move into the house with their little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). Shortly after moving, however, the family has to discover that there is something terribly wrong in the house, which is apparently obsessed ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is much better than his previous mediocre entry, "Growing Pains" ( Episode 4), and quite unknown actors offer good performances. The film is also well done in terms of effects, cinematography and score. "The house that bled to death" is a solid episode that presents the elements that my fellow Hammer fans would like to see in a short horror story. The film offers a spooky atmosphere, genuine moments of fear and intelligent turns, and is exciting and very entertaining from the beginning to the end. In general, this is highly recommended for Hammer fans.
