While it is universally acknowledged that Fearful Symmetry was strongly influenced by the episode of Kolchak They Have Been, They Are, Will Be, whether this makes it a scam or a tribute is a more controversial point. As a big fan of both series, I subscribe to this last belief, although it is possible that the less charitable do not. James Whitmore was brave enough to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode, the invisible elephants and the gorilla suits sound like a recipe for disaster, but he does it with style, since the teaser is a real gem. Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible Kyle Lang character and Jack Rader is threatened as Ed Meecham. Forget the dubious originality of Fearful Symmetry and simply enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X File.
