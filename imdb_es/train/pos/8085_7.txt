One thing I can say about this movie is very long, VERY LONG! I recently bought this movie a couple of months ago when I saw a new version come out. I was happy to discover that it was made in 1978 because The 70's (although I never lived in them) is one of my favorite decades, especially for music! When I saw this movie, the story was very good at first, but after about 50 minutes it started to be very boring and repetitive. I admit that the animation impressed me! It was nothing I had seen before and it was very good to see. but, honestly, the movie could have been a little better, I could have talked a lot more and told him more than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that only had weird fights. Then, during the last 5 or 10 minutes, the movie resumed and became good again, but it ended unexpectedly. In my opinion, I thought it was extremely long. I know it's 13 minutes in 2 hours and it's still long for a caricature, but since it was boring for most of the movie, it seemed like it would last 4 hours! But, in general, it's a good movie, I suppose, and I'll see her again on one of those "days with nothing to do". I'll see the new one and hope it's better!
