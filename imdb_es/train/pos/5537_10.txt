Maybe it was not so good in general, but the second episode, which was the first one I said, was so memorable that I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries. <br /> <br /> The Cockney jargon of the partner, Chico Barnes, is much more fun for those of us who have never been close to listening to the London Arc. Bells, but the cables are attractive and the shows interesting. <br /> <br /> Sid Halley was one of Francis's most interesting characters, and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand. Interestingly, the electronic hands of the type used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the type invented after the Second World War.
