If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination, without the need to start singing every twelve minutes, this is the Disney movie for you! My children loved every minute of this movie, and I must admit that I laughed out loud many times throughout the movie. There are no silly songs that get in the way of a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all kind and identifiable in their own right. This should be one of Disney's "classics" because of its beautifully illustrated landscape and its incessant excitement!
