The British horror film was in terminal decline in the early seventies, but out of the darkness came three films that were among the best produced by our island. The Wickerman, Blood on Satan's Claw and The House That Dripped Blood made the future look optimistic, even though many people knew that at this point there would not be one. THTDB has the kind of cast that could easily make a wish list, if it had not really met, in the grim interior of 2008 you may find yourself waiting to wake up. Waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is, naturally, my favorite. The life and art of Cushing are interconnected so firmly that you can not tell where the interpretation ends and where the pain begins. You can only guess how this role affected such a gentle and sensitive man. Death and the Lady. RIP Peter.
