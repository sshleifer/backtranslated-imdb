I wish the children's films were still made this way; Dark and deep. There was (get this) the development of the character (and Charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character), the development of the plot, the excellent animation, the emotional participation and a rational, related and coherent theme. If it were not for the handful of song and dance routines, you would never have thought that this was a children's movie, and that's why I give it such a high rating. This movie is an excellent movie, much less for a children's movie. Which brings me to my second point: this has to be the darkest film for "kids" I've seen in a long time, this comes from a 22 year old boy. I would be surprised to see any child under the age of 8 without being completely terrified for much of the second half and part of the first half of the movie, and it ends with one of the saddest endings you can find. (wing "Jurassic Bark", for those of you who are fans of 'Futurama'), and this is what makes this movie so good. The fact that the film universally evokes emotions that we normally do not like to feel and assume that they are bad does not make the film itself bad; In fact, it means that he succeeded. It is supposed that good funny movies make us laugh; Good horror movies are supposed to scare us; It is supposed that good sad movies make us sad. My point is that good movies are supposed to MOVE you, not just entertain; This movie moved me. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this film is incredibly violent by today's standards of a children's movie and contains themes that, by current standards, may not be suitable for some children. Parents, I would say look first. I do not usually say anything about this kind of thing, but I saw it yesterday and it was a surprise even for me.
