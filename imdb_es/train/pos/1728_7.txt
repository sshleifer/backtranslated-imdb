The Wooden Horse was one of the first "great" escape stories of World War II, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others in his escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really like this movie, but I had to do it. I put it on VHS from Amazon in England and I transfer it from the PAL format in the United States. I read the book when I was in high school, having watched a part of the movie in the early 60's on television. The drama of Peter and John trying. Escape from Germany during the war is more realistic than the trail of escapes portrayed in the Great Escape. This movie is a lost treasure, which should be more available to the American public.
