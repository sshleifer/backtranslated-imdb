We finally got a TV series where we can see the acting talent! Episode one was excellent! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, there was still the "I'm not your father, I'm your father and omigod deceived me!" trash, but the script allowed the actors to feel and live those real moments instead of showing how they would feel if so many soap operas did. <br /> <br /> The work with the camera also gave us a bit more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours, however, there were no "shots inside shots or camera shit with the hand "to add a" The artistic advantage gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful pictures of landscapes! <br /> <br /> Nothing was too dramatized or melodramatic, they were real people in a real place that dealt with Real situations, the show did not lack anything in the drama and it was completely relevant It was a relief to be exposed to real acting and it was very nice to let our country see how talented our actors can be when given a real script, a real opportunity! Thanks Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and the whole cast and wonderful work team! Please, continue what you are doing, your efforts are very appreciated and do not go unnoticed.
