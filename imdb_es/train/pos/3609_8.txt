I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and had no idea if I made a bad purchase or a good one. It is the subsequent result of seeing the whole movie from beginning to end. Michelle Rodriguez, (Diana Guzm√°n), "BloodRayne", '05, gave a great presentation and her appearance is beautiful, sexy and, at the same time, a real study in the art of how to act really acting. Diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave his mother. She decides to receive boxing training at a local Brooklyn gym and is not very well accepted by male boxers. In her high school there is a lot of friction between her classmates and men. There is a lot of action in the ladies' room and references to private parties of boys. If you like boxing, and see a sexy and sexy girl do wonders in the ring and hit the guys so they know what, this is the movie for you.
