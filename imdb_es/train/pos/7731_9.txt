<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a strange mixture of sensuality and dullness. The film is slow, very slow, but it takes a rhythm to tell a story about murder and passion. Jason Patric was never so sexy and powerful (the man gives a real performance), and Rachel Ward is almost sexy. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension, the psychological heat, the steps of the past ... The scenes of flashback, the rarity of Patric's character, everything becomes a sexy mystery. I recommend this because the sexiest and boring movie I've ever seen. Look at the love scene, it's particularly sexy.
