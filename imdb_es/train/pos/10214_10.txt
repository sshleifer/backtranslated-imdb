For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like to watch movies without any idea of ​​what will happen, therefore, I think many of the other reviews in this movie contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie again, and I must reiterate that it has the BEST ending to any movie. Forever. Forever. Forever. The actual translation, 'The beating of the butterfly wings', is strangely not used as a translated title. I guess they thought that most Americans would not know what chaos theory is (except those who saw or read "Jurassic Park"). The film is based on the theory of chaos and how a small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, which leads to an event. The movie is a whirlwind of wonderful causes and effects, since we follow the chain of chaos as it is intertwined between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the ending seems inevitable despite this, but if you think about it, it's a perfect ending. Think to yourself, "what else do you need to say"? It is at the same time a very brave ending. Too bad we have to go abroad to find a gem like this, but an ending like this will NEVER leave Hollywood. <br /> <br />
