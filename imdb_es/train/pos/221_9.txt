I remember seeing this movie originally at the Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I did not really understand the humor back then, but this movie can make me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> With due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this movie. His performance is incredible, given that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. Their gestures are of the first order. ("Do you know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when he speaks with the Spanish-speaking boy at the reception: "No, no, no enchilada!") Absolutely hilarious! <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Richard Benjamin, who played the direct man of Matthau. <br /> <br /> I just wish this was on DVD, because my VHS recording is getting a little old. <br /> <br /> I had no interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen, because in no way can it match the original.
