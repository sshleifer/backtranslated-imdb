I just saw this in Turner Classic Movies last night, for the first time seeing it, and I loved it. I like many of the old movies, especially due to the absence of all the dirty language, and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most movies today. I also think that they became much better in many cases (but not all). Jimmy Stewart is one of my favorites. I just thought that this movie was very fun to watch, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you feel the same for old movies, I do not think you can go wrong with this one. I think "You Have Got Mail" is a remake (although slightly different and also a very entertaining movie) of this movie. To enjoy a relaxing evening with a movie, do not be ashamed if your children or anyone involved in your visit, buy this or capture it in one of the classic movie channels.
