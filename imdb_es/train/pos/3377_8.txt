Soylent Green is a classic. I've been waiting for someone to do it again. It seems that they are remaking the science fiction classics these days (ie, War of the Worlds) and I hope some director / producer will do Soylent Green again. With today's technology and computer animation, it would have the potential to be a great image. Anti-utopia films may not be so implausible. The human race reproduces like cockroaches without external influence to shorten it. We, as humans, have the option of putting the kibosh in the procreation of minor species if they get out of hand, but there is nothing that controls human reproduction, except ourselves. Despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc., the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a Petri dish. Classic Malthusian economics states that any species, including humans, will multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion and growing ... that's obscene.
