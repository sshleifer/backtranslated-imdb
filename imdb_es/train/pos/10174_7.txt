This was another message from the Second World War to the soldiers and the Allies to be careful to spread rumors. These were called "instructional" cartoons because they were a mix of serious messages along with a fun-looking main character called "Pvt. Snafu." <br /> <br /> We all have imagination, along with fears and what. have-you, and that's what happens here as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and says "five." You can start panic and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. That includes losing confidence in your country and its cause, as noted here in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. That is still being done today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war", declares a great nonsense near the end of this cartoon. It's amazing how some Americans have not yet learned. This caricature may be 65 years old, but it sure has relevance today. As I write this, there were two terrorist attacks in Europe today and some people still think that the "War on Terror" is just a sticker slogan. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The writer, the famous "Dr. Suess", uses analogies of "hot air balloon juice" here to present the previous message. With Theodore Geisel (his real name) you know that the rhymes will be intelligent. <br /> <br /> There's nothing funny here, but it was not meant to be. You must understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that existed during the Second World War. People forget that the war could easily end with the other winning side. It was a tense time
