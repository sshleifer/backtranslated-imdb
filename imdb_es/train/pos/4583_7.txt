['I saw this in a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the subcharacters were excessively exaggerated. This took away the film as well as the rather scanty musical score, which really bothered me throughout the entire film. If the musical score was improved, I could ignore the few scenes that were overcome. Then the movie would be much, much better.']
