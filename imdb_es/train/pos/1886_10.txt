I have loved this movie since its debut in 1981! I've lost count of how many times I've seen it! It never stops making me laugh or cheer up if I feel sad. The three drivers are fantastic and the script is priceless, also, how does not it make you nostalgic to hear the theme? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. Basically, I know the whole script, so when someone looks at it for the first time, I have to say something about how funny the next line is. Although I can not limit it, although the character of Sir John is probably the most memorable. The famous "I'll alert the media" when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless, but the list is truly endless. The Arthur's scene, soon to be the home of her fiance's father, is a scream, particularly her interactions with the elk. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
