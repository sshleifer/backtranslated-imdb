S. S. Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman when dealing with Hollywood. Most movie series on study days were generally limited to one or two studies. But apparently, Van Dine must have sold his rights to every book about Philo Vance one by one. Keep in mind that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and more released Philo Vance movies. Only Tarzan seemed to move more for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> MGM produced the murder case in the garden and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashion detective. Of course, MGM had the original Philo of the screen under contract at that time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at that time and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate it there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is a very acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started quite big at the end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a series of films with Victor McLaglen with his characters Flagg and Quirt. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to vanish in the B-photos market. <br /> <br /> The murder case in the garden involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere that surrounds the perpetrator reveals it, the mystery is really how all the murders are connected and how they are carried out. <br /> <br /> However, I will say this. Vance has a great opportunity to expose the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
