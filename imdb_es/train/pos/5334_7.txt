Look, even if we do not like to admit it, we all have to suppress our fears regarding the extreme possibility of experiencing the events that take place in this film. You know: you get in your car and immediately you start thinking: "Gee, I hope today is not the day my accelerator stays at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 mph, the four door latches are broken in the lock position, both The main brake and the emergency brake fail, my ignition switch can not be turned off and I have a tank full of gasoline, all simultaneously ". Fortunately, for most of us, our Thorazine is activated before we really decide it's a bad idea to drive a car. Not so for the action creators of the heartbreaking, white knuckle, edge of your seat (even if only in preparation to leave the room), "Car runaway" But go ahead and drive anyway! <br /> <br /> I am infinitely pleased to have found (thanks to imdb) that this movie is real and that I did not simply dream it. <br /> <br /> This movie is, at least, one of the fantastic places you'll see on your trip to find El Dorado from Very Bad Cinema. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
