['Trapped in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel that showed it from the beginning. First, the Canon of Pachelbel made a lump in my throat, then the vision of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I have flown) produced a slight moisture around the eyes and then the name of Crowe hooked me completely. I was fascinated by this film, Crowe&#39;s performance (again), the theme (and yes, the debt we have), how the various issues were addressed and dealt with, the flying sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons, too), the story - and, as noted by another contributor, the recitation of Crowe&#39;s High Flight. I will not spoil the film for anyone, but, separated from my wife by more than 4,000 miles, as a former army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as a private pilot, I admit that I cry a couple of times. Buy it, fix it, download it, borrow or steal, but look at it. <br /><br /> PS: Did I see a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the floor? It looked like a twin-engine plane with a double .303 Brownings in a dorsal turret.']
