Wonderful James Stewart, vehicle Vera Miles. What makes this historic film that deals with the FBI so good is the familiar element that is involved during a 35-year career as shown by Stewart in the film. <br /> <br /> The film shows the history of the great research agency. These are planes bombing plans, killing Indians in Oklahoma to obtain real estate benefits, fighting against organized crime, Nazis and communists in that order. The human element is never far behind when Stewart marries Vera Miles. They raise 3 children while Miles's heart goes out every time Stewart leaves the assignment. <br /> <br /> Look for a brief but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later, he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967 in "The Graduate." <br /> <br /> The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He certainly put the FBI on par. <br /> <br /> It's true, this could be seen as a right-wing propaganda, especially with Stewart's real-life Republican views, but it's well-done, historically informative, and the view of The Family so well represented.
