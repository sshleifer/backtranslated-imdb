The Japanese "Run Lola Run" is an unconventional movie that will put a smile on anyone's face. The fans of Run Lola Run, Tampopo, Go!, And Slacker are probably going to like this one. It tends to follow a formula that is increasingly popular in these days of separate, seemingly unrelated vignettes that contribute to the overall story in an unexpected way. Catch it if you see it, otherwise wait for the rent.
