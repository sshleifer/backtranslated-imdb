['New York I Love You, like its predecessor (Paris Je T&#39;Aime), is a composite of several stories that reflect the different types and aspects of love, but unlike it, the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter. The film offers a unique view of New York City with its diverse and different landscapes. New York, I Love You offers a first class cast, with great actors such as Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Ian McKellen, Hayden Christensen, Chistina Rcci and Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawke, James Caan and Robin Wright Penn, among others and some writers excellent and directors like Brett Ratner and Anthony Mingella.']
