['IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in a company along with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the former hire a professional assassin, ANISIO, to assassinate ESTEVÃO (the plot, at least at the beginning, does not mean it). It does. &quot;I explain very well why). The guy does it and, after receiving his money, begins to blackmail the two partners, appears in his company and says he wants a job there (as a supervisor or something ...). At the same time he meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter of ESTEVÃO, and starts dating her! <br /><br /> In a story like this, where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be a victim, an exception made to MARINA, who is the only person who does not know what is happening and it did not. betray anyone ... <br /><br /> This film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality that exists in large metropolises like São Paulo, where crime is the presence of every day. We can feel irony, but also veracity in characters like ANISIO (played brilliantly by Paulo Miklos), who blackmails the guys who paid him without any scruples, and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed! He really must be a monster to do something like that, but of course I know there are people like him, in Brazil or anywhere else ... <br /><br /> It&#39;s a very good movie, cruel but true, about a sad reality ... The performance is excellent and the soundtrack too.']
