I think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie! or damn Australian? I still do not know, but what I do know is that I really liked this movie, but that could not be my favorite movie! <br /> <br /> Great story with great actors but with a terrible ending ... To make you cry and say 'Oh, she's so good' ... Still, who did? What really happened? Who's that boy? There is no answer to these questions ... <br /> <br /> Mysterious film with a good note in general ... I give it an 8/10, going on 8.5!
