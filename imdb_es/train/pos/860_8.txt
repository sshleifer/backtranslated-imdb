Audiard made a very interesting film here. It begins with the description of an almost deaf young woman, in her universe of work as a secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Hiring an inmate as an assistant seems to be a way to find someone in your life: but the guy just got out of jail. The fact that both are rejected by society brings them together progressively. The description of the characters is profound, it goes into details ... both begin to help each other; because he can read on the lips, what is very useful for him ... Evolving progressively, far from what he was at the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed; The set is very convincing, even if it turns into a black cinema at the end. The gesture is particularly well observed in the shooting of Audiard. Emmanuelle Devos must be nominated for the Best Actress Cesar Awards for her masterful play. The action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". Actually it's surprisingly entertaining: 8/10.
