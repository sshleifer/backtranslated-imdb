Pierce Brosnan will probably be the only familiar in Richard Attenborough's new biopic. The rest is new to the international audience: History of Canada and Culture of First Nations. <br /> <br /> "Gray Owl" is a light exam of how a man came to be adopted on the Ojibway of northern Ontario, learning and preaching environmentalism. Decades before it was politically correct to do so. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by his past. However, that torture does not always come alive with the dramatic impact it could have. <br /> <br /> However, it is a film that keeps its audience free of violence. It deeply respects the First Nations of Canada and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotyped manner. Brosnan's performance is somewhat rigid, but I suspect that this is how Lord Attenborough wanted it. <br /> <br /> Thanks from a proud Canadian.
