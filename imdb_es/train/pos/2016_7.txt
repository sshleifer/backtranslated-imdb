['Higher and Higher was one of the minor Broadway musicals by Rodgers &amp; Hart. In 1940 he only had a series of 84 performances on Broadway. However, he produced one of his greatest hits, It Never Entered My Mind. <br /><br /> However, with the exception of one minor song, So Disgustingly Rich, the Broadway score was removed when RKO bought the rights to the film. Instead, a new score by Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson was written, mainly to accommodate a Francis Albert Sinatra who was making his film debut. <br /><br /> Sinatra, who had made some vocal cameos in previous films, takes a sheet from the page of his rival singer Bing Crosby. When Bing made his film debut on The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took on the role of Frank Sinatra and I can not think of someone who could have done a better job. <br /><br /> The Chairman of the Board is third here behind the stars Jack Haley and Michele Morgan. He is the butler and she is the maid of Leon Errol. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who has not paid his help for seven months. Mainly because he is about to fall in chapter 11 or at least that informs the staff. <br /><br /> Errol is a lovely old soul to work for and none of the employees wants to lose something good. They pool their resources and have Michele Morgan pose as Errol&#39;s daughter in Switzerland with her mother. The idea is to get a rich money with the hope of rescuing the family fortune. Only Michele starts looking at another. <br /><br /> It&#39;s a light plot and certainly not worse than many musicals, but RKO invested this movie with a good cast of players. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon play another debutante and her mother who suspects something is not right, Victor Borge is a fortune that does not seek accounts, Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes, interpret others from the Errol family. personal. It is not a bad group at all. <br /><br /> Sinatra sang three good ballads, all had some kind of commercial success, The Music Stopped, A lovely way to spend a night, and I could not sleep a wink last night. The last one was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song, but lost to Never Never Know of Alice Faye. <br /><br /> 1943 was the year in which Musician&#39;s Union Strike against the record industry. To get his material out, Frank Sinatra recorded the songs of Higher and Higher with an acapella choir for Columbia. Bing Crosby recorded songs from his movie Dixie in the same way for Decca. Both were denounced by the president of the union, James C. Petrillo as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again. The strike was not completely resolved until 1944, although Decca separated from the other record companies and was established before Columbia, RCA Victor and the others. <br /><br /> The strike provided some moments of anxiety for Sinatra. He had just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the strike was called. He closed a necessary place for his art when he was not sure if leaving Dorsey would turn out to be a right decision in his career. <br /><br /> Fortunately, Superior and Superior were received and a legend was launched.']
