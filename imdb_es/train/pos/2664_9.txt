Even though The Shining is more than a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone not to be scared by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that nobody has been able to cheat it; Instead, it has been referenced again and again in pop culture. The twins, the blood riser, RedRum, the crazy "writing" ... this should be seen, if only to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously frightening, suspenseful, beautiful and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what terror films usually lack: a great script.
