The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. It's exciting without gore, it's beautifully filmed and the art direction is impeccable. The casting could not have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in geniuses. And the epitome of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> .. I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and I never get tired. This movie is an adventure for all ages ... no one is too old to enjoy it. The Thief of Bahgdad traces my memories to a more innocent moment ... I was ten years old the first time I saw him and EE. UU I was about to enter World War II. Conrad Vieght was a great actor who could continue this "evil" underlying a few years later in "Casablanca". And Korda joined, I think, with Justin and Dupree again in "The Four Feathers" ... a great movie!
