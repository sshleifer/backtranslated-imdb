There are so many words that I want to use to describe this movie, but I really can not do that, right? This movie is a movie to see if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then urinate. I'm serious. Do not see this movie if you are easily offended by blasphemy, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything related to nature. Being a woman, and that might not be a factor, I can watch this movie again and again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all your other debuts, I think Baseketball is the winner of the prize. Now I'm laughing just thinking about some of the stupid things that they do in the movie. Watch the movie!! That is all what I am going to say. It is a bit difficult for me to leave this comment because I am one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse word in almost every phrase that comes out of his mouth when they speak. So I'm keeping it professional. Best film. Heck yes!
