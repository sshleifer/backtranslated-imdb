This is a very interesting project that could have been quite brilliant. Gathering 11 prominent international directors and assigning each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; each short exploring the global reverberations of 9/11. Without using spoilers, I would say Ken Loach's piece is the jewel in the crown, and Mira Nair's short (segment "India"), based on a true story, deserves to become a full movie. One also realizes, while watching his short film, why is Alejandro González Iñárritu one of the best directors in the world today? He is simply a master of the medium, who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made too. Youssef Chahine, in his segment "Egypt", assumes the Arab position of collective self-inflicted guilt, whose piece could have been the most interesting. It fails miserably. Chahine's short film is badly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out among other movie's top chapters. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still give the 7/10 movie as a concept, if not for execution.
