['This show has some clich√©s and some exaggerated, moments like Dawson&#39;s Creek (a 16 year old speaks of when life made sense?), But in general it seems a decent show. Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seems to move well in the pilot, ending with a good lesson at the end. I just hope that each episode does not change the life like the first, that would be too much drama for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job when he was a teenager passionate about baseball, I think many of us could relate to his amazement and, sometimes, the tunnel vision of the team he always wanted to participate.']
