I can really say that I felt the film in its correct essence, where the mental games of the dreamy reality enter the surreal aspect of the future that Tom Cruise faces. I did not care much about Tom Cruise's acting skill, but I must say he seems to impress at every point of the movie ... not only because of an engaging story, but also because of his self-taught character. ... they merge and then they talk and it's beautiful. However, I must say that this movie is not included in the "average weekend movie" that you choose at random and you see it with joy; It carries strong feelings and characters, so do not wash it with your beer and pop-tripe. It certainly needs more than that.
