In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of the French and their enemies are the Tupiniquins, friends of the Portuguese. A Frenchman (Arduino Colassanti) is captured by the Tupinambás and, despite his trial to convince them that he is French, they believe he is Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes his slave and lives maritally with Seboipepe (Ana María Magalhães). Later, he uses gunpowder in the cannons that the Portuguese left behind to defeat the Tupiniquins in a battle. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat it. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso or Meu Francês" is another great low-budget film by the great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. The script is very original and the story is spoken in tupi. The film is taken with natural light most of the time and is very realistic. The actors and actresses act naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is magnificent, shows a wonderful body and offers an impressive performance. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. This film shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by the Europeans, focusing on the Portuguese and French at that time, trading with the Indians and exchanging combs and mirrors with our natural resources. This film was awarded at national festivals, such as the Brazilian Film Festival of Brasilia (Brasilia Festival of Brazilian Cinema) of 1971, with Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialogue (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Cenograph (Régis Monteiro); Association of Art Critics of São Paulo (Associação Paulista dos Críticos de Arte), with the best Revelation of the Year (Ana María Magalhães) and some other prizes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso or Meu Francês" ("How tasty was my French")
