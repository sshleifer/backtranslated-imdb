I have not seen this movie, but I must. After having read the three books of Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I am actively looking for a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The thesis that Peruvians migrated to Polynesia is alive and well. Considering that this equipment had NO GPS, and only a tube radio (tube) with a 6 watt output, his trip was heroic, at least. <br /> <br /> Please respond to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy it.
