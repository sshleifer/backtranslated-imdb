I was reviewing some old VHS tapes that I found and found the TV show John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together. This made me go to my computer and look for it to see if I could find a DVD version of this program to buy. I was disappointed not to be able to find it on DVD yet. The show was broadcast in 1979 and it was a lovely show. I have the disc and the CD, but I would love to buy a DVD version of this program. The tape is old and the quality of the image is quite good, but it fades, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also some other songs that are not put on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and the Muppets, a DVD of this program would really be a good seller. If you do not have the CD, it is a wonderful collection of Chritmas songs taken from that program. The album is also good if you can find it and you still have a disc player to play it.
