The alternative title of Ecstasy, is Symphony of Love; A title that adequately describes the mood and feel of the movie. Ecstasy is one of the first talkies, and it could have been a classic movie if it was released during the era of silent movies. This film is a visual delight, and is developed deliberately so that the viewer can savor its sensual lyric quality, which is presented in a discreet artistic way. The director's style is clearly European. The theme and focus of sexuality were much more sophisticated than what was happening in Hollywood at that time. Consider the censorship code in the United States, during the 1930s, which sums it up quite well. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was the perfect choice for this "Symphony of love".
