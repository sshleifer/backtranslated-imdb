Refreshing lost gem! With an effective dialogue combined with an excellent performance to establish the characters and get involved enough to worry about what happens to them. The characters of Douglas and Widmark are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence. Widmark won the fisticuffs fight scene, a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a "logical" ending and a long chase on foot that embarrasses the exaggerated pursuit sequences of contemporary Hollywood. You know how it is likely to end, but suspense and interest remain in everything. The end of the persecution is one of the most realistic you'll ever see. The film seems to slow down a bit beyond the middle, but stays with it to get a rewarding conclusion.
