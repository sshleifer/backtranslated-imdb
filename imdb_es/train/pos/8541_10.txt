I know, that's not what you expect from a movie with this kind of <br /> <br /> lineage: it's a direct descendant of The Best Years of our Lives <br /> <br /> and The Men .. Movies that deal with men who are in the hospital <br /> <br /> dealing with tragic circumstances. But this movie is full of wonderful surprises and performances. It features stellar performances by <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including a rather risky nude scene) <br /> <br /> and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe. As Emanuel Levy wrote <br /> <br /> in his book Cinema of Outsiders (on the independent film movement <br /> <br />) "Waterdance is coherent, attentive to details, and <br / > <br "not sentimental with an evil humor to the earth; it's both <br /> <br /> funny and sad, and the whole cast is awesome. "I was <br /> <br /> extraordinarily moved by this movie, it's hard to hit himself, but he also has <br> /> <br /> very tender moments and moments of laughter, a rare jewel.
