['Shawshank, the godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all the good movies. Great movies But nothing, and I mean that nothing is up to the best Christmas movie of all, Santa Claus. <br /><br /> The movie is great and has so many messages, I cried while watching it. Seriously, this is one of those movies that you need to watch 10 times. When we see that Pitch is told he will have to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel the deep sadness, and then we ask ourselves ... what&#39;s wrong with this ice cream? Does it imply that we, as humans, treat ice cream as good when all it does is make us bad? Think that the movie makes you think. <br /><br /> This movie has the best version of Santa Claus. Unlike other saints, he is a normal person. We see him imprisoning children and spying on children&#39;s dreams, and we ask ourselves; Is it the Santa we really believe in so good? Also, this Santa Claus really mentions Christ, all the meaning behind Christmas. <br /><br /> You must see this cinematographic masterpiece. We should just stop making movies and not broadcast anything other than this epic 24/7. Whether it&#39;s Christmas or not, this movie receives a 500/10. Who says that this movie is bad is an ignorant fool.']
