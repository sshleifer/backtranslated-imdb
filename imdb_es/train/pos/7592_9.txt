I just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion (and justice) to the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, to clarify things, this movie is not meant to be anything other than solid action. comedy film. It does not pretend to revolutionize the film industry and accumulate critical acclamations, nor does it want to be considered as one. If you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest, I suggest you discard your critical mindset and your longing for a good plot because you will not find any here. With that established, let's continue with the movie. <br /> <br /> I had little expectations for this movie simply because I did not have a solid plot (Yes, moviegoers, I also underestimated this film), but I never expected you to enjoy this movie so much. I even enjoyed this more than Stephen Chow's films (I think Kung Fu Hustle is his best effort and I would have qualified him with a 9 as well). The action is tense and epic, while the comedy drowns in the right places. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS alert, I think the action could be unreal, but why would I want to see a serious basketball movie? There are many other sports films (drama) that already did well, why create another one? SPOILERS ends <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure why you're reading this. Go ahead and look at it. Just remember, do not think, just look, enjoy, smile, laugh and <br /> <br /> From time to time they (the film industry) create masterpieces like Pulp Fiction or The Godfather, and sometimes they create Movies that are better in the dumpster pile. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have, then, again, if we're talking about Stephen Chow-ish's comedy, this is one of the top ten. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if love: -I do not think movies with very good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy -What the heck, look at this. you will have a great time <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you the cast of Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
