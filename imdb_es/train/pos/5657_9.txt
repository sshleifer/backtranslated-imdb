I remember seeing American Gothic when it was aired for the first time, it came to my mind recently, all I could remember was the same guy who appeared on Midnight Caller, who is Gary Cole, I do not watch much television, but I did see American Gothic. I bought the full series on DVD this week, and it's still as good as ever. This is one of the best television series in history, the reason why I do not watch much television is because there is only trash, except Derren Brown. All Reality TV or Soaps, like Grease, Big Brother, etc., I'm sick of it, I got the American Gothic Complete Series for Â£ 16.97 from the Asda website, that's the cheapest thing I can find.
