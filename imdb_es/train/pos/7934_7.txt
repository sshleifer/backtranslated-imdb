According to this board, I suppose you either love it or hate it. Usually, how it goes with all the movies. However, there is no need to get upset with others. All we are doing here is giving opinions. I rented this movie last night and I want to come and express my opinion in the mix. However, I was surprised at how many people are hitting him. There is a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. I'm a fan of the horror movie. Ol√© movie fans do not like horror movies. There are so many low budget movies that are coming out these days. It is difficult to keep up. And what makes it difficult to stay in these movies is how bad they are. I wanted to come and write a comment about "Hood of the Living Dead" because it is very good compared to the rest of the trash there is. It's nothing special, but it's the horror filmmakers who try to be too serious and end up making a horrible horror movie. Really I liked this. Are you telling me that there is no effort in this? And one more thing, I bet you all have all these huge DVD collections that you're so proud of, nothing more than Major Motion Pictures, right? There is nothing wrong with that, but you have to know how to appreciate the low budget independently. I knew what I was getting when I saw this movie. I'm not going to get mad because I thought it was going to be a 100 million dollar movie. It is possible that some of you should continue to see the Matrix over and over again and stop trying to compare everything with the Matrix. And if most of you are under 24, that explains everything. Good people from the movie, take a look.
