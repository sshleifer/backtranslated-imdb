This is by far one of my favorites of the American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems to be unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenage boy surrounded by naked girls from college, and one in particular chases him to get rid of his "problem" of virginity and ends up stopping in the middle of the action and riding a horse to go back to sleep with his girlfriend, who In mind he gave her a "guilt-free pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of all this, but let's be realistic; Most people who are watching these movies are not looking particularly for a romantic story. <br /> <br /> While the last installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses smell and, as always, Mr. Levenstein lends his eyebrow humor "perfectly natural "to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie.
