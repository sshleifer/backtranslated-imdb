My 3 year old son loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 of our family. As for the level of violence? It's not really that violent, mostly of the slap-stick variety. No one really dies, no blood, no blood, no torture, so it is certainly appropriate for children, much more than many cartoons on Saturday mornings. <br /> <br /> This movie really takes the idea of ​​CG movies where it should. Go. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics, beautifully made textures, with real depth, not trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. The moss in the stones, the rust in the metal, the reliefs in the wood and the stone, all add to the whole. <br /> <br /> Character modeling, unlike many contemporary CG films, is quirky, not cute, again within an artistic whole. The faces may seem less malleable than in other movies, but the characters are more puppets than humans. I think that is good, it gives truth, the strange thing that can sound, it is easier to suspend your disbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, hair, clothes, at par, at least with Pixar. Just notice in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu is fighting the giant slug; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers, and they all have detailed clothes that made me stop the movie just to admire it. <br /> <br /> The scenario. Far beyond the likes of cars, and even Wall? E. The space has been done many times, but the fantasy environments of the Dragon Hunters are only comparable with some scenes from The Endless Story and The Lord of the Rings, but again it is an artistic whole, and with many good ideas thrown without effort. Magnificent views like the scene in Monsters Inc., where all the doors are mounted through their storage facilities, or Wall Street, where we see the immense towers of garbage that he made, abound in this movie, everything is great, but never stopped It's just the bottom all the way! The interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls. The Chinese wall, the islands floating in the sky. The broccoli in the sky? That's where I think the CG should go, create something that takes your breath away and do it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is varied and not only epic, and fortunately without any voice, and purely original for the movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Lend inspiration to the cartoons, especially a good use of stretching and compression. Sometimes it's not that realistic, but 3D models are not realistic either. <br /> <br /> The characterization is also well done. Lian-Chu, the gentle and uncertain giant, is gradually growing in confidence, attracting the attention of little Zoé. <br /> <br /> Gwizdo, the shrewd manager of Lian-Chu, redeems himself at the end, while Zoé has not really changed at all, but who wants that cute little boy to change anyway? At least I loved Lian-Chu more than any other recent character since Sulley in Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> The internal struggle in the group is solved by external pressures, just as it should be in a fantasy story appropriate <br /> <br /> History remembers above all the story of Never ending, especially how the world separates. Monsters are pretty standard, except flocking. Does it lack Wall's emotional impact? And, that is the really strong point of that movie, but it is a much more fun ride, and it lacks the annoying musical scene that is repeated in the previous one, and it has action from the first scene. This movie is what you want to see for a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The complete film, as I mentioned, a complete vision, which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout. <br /> <br /> It seems that the stage is ready for more adventures, and I hope so. <br /> <br /> A side note, the French actor who plays Lian-Chu sounded a bit like Jean Reno in Primero, but I'm happy it was not him, although he's one of my favorites. Pleased to hear a new one, for me, the voice. <br /> <br /> I give a maximum rating, a little surprised by the mediocre and low rating of some; I have tried to address some of the concerns raised by two of the exams with the lowest vote. Come to this film as an adventure, and as a European film, not unlike Hollywood, but different.
