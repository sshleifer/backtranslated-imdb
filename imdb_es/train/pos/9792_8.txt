['Once a year a movie like that &quot;comes&quot; and makes things easier for you. You do not have to make an effort to think that it&#39;s good, it just is. You enjoy it while you watch it, and you take it home with you. I can not say that it is totally impeccable, but it is close. Acting - great, interesting story and with elements of suspense. It&#39;s a small family story, quite predictable, but it&#39;s not the secret that matters. It is the way in which the blind girl needs to reach it. I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I did not like very much is the actress who played the mother, it was too hard and without need. Keren']
