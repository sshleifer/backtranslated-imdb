['I have seen many television movies in my student days, most of them the loss of normal television time in the United States. This, however, was well designed and laid out, and had a very nice touch at the end. Having seen only Richard Dean Anderson at MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised by his excellent performance rather than the wide range of AB expressions he normally gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after a long time dating back to The Fly II. It is also good to see Robert Guillaumme in a leading role again. I can not say that I&#39;ve ever taken Jane Leeves seriously after her days at Benny Hill, but she almost managed to cope with her role. In short, a highly recommended film.']
