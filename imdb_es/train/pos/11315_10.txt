['Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries. The great directors of Italy in the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium, but it was Luchino Visconti, a man of vision, who dared to bring a film to show what he was capable of doing. He clearly shows his genius at the beginning of his distinguished career with &quot;Ossessione,&quot; a film based on James Cain&#39;s &quot;The Postman Always Ring Twice,&quot; which was later made by Hollywood, but that version pales in comparison to what Visconti achieved. in the film. . Luchino Visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited Alberto Moravia, a man who knew the effect of passion on human beings. <br /><br /> The movie has been well preserved in the DVD format we saw recently. The film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how Visconti&#39;s vision translated the text into a film that sounds true in a plausible way, something that the American version lacked. <br /><br /> What you see when watching the movie is the intensity that the director obtained from his key players. The gorgeous Clara Calamai does an amazing job as Giovanna, the woman who has married an older man, but when Gino appears in her life, all she wants is to get rid of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life. Giovanna is one of the best creations of Mrs. Calamai&#39;s achievements in Italian cinema. The final sequence of the film shows Ms. Calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed. <br /><br /> Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti, one of the best actors of his generation who appears as Gino, the man who awakens the obsessive passion in Giovanna. Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna, something that Mr. Girotti projects with such ease and sophistication on the screen. Girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy, but with another actor might not have been so obvious. Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe, the older man who fell in love with Giovanna. In fact, his character sounds truer than his counterpart in the American movie, where he looks more like a buffoon. <br /><br /> The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way the Italian directors of the era favored. The original musical score by Giuseppe Rosati is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, also includes Bizet and Verdi arias that fit well in the context of the film. <br /><br /> &quot;Ossessione&quot; is a movie to treasure because we see a great Luchino Visconti at his best.']
