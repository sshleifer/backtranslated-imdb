['Some have compared this movie with Deliverance. I think of mice and men is more appropriate. Our protagonist, Heaton, definitely loves Spike. It is irrelevant and immaterial if that is a sexual love. That&#39;s why Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs it. They need each other. As brothers, as a family, as your only connection with humanity. The stage, the stage, the minimum distribution add up to a good movie. Frankly, I did not care what happened to the characters. But I did not care what the filmmaker did with them. He did well with them. I spent some time wondering how the end of Mice and Men would look like. The soundtrack and the cinematography were fascinating and intriguing.']
