['This is a great movie. Probably the best movie I&#39;ve seen. I see it again and again. I must give 10/10 stars because as I said, this is probably the best movie I&#39;ve seen. This movie + Popcorn + Coca = Best mix you can imagine. If you want to see a movie, I recommend this one. First I saw it, I liked it, so I bought it and now I own it and I probably see it every day. My children like it and think that this is the best movie ever seen. This movie is about Guy In Fantasy World. I do not want to spoil the whole movie so I can enjoy it after reading my text. Lovely Movie Lovely Characters, Lovely Story, And just great things. You have to see the movie. I hope you enjoyed my comment Cya <br /><br /> Jim do']
