Well, after a long anticipation after seeing some clips in Bravo's 100 Most Dreadful Moments, I waited a lot to see this movie. The plot was simple, the beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves to an apartment building that is a gateway to hell. The Sentinel is a creepy movie, even if it's a bit slow. It's a mix of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The acting is fine, and there are some really disturbing fragments, like the uncomfortable scene of the orgy with the dead father and the chubby girl in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing. The ending is a rare mixture of deformed and cannibalistic people. It's a very strange movie, but in the end, I really believe in a great movie! One of my favorites from the 70s, although it's nothing very original. It's weird and extremely spooky! Probably one of my favorites of all time. 9/10
