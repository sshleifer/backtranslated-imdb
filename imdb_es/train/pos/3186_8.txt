I think this movie is very nice. The plot is simple and easy to digest, the humor is light and clean, and because the plot of a mistaken identity is quite common, I feel anxious to see how this film makes this story come true. It turns out to be very nice. The performance of the female protagonist is admirable; His interpretation of an innocent and naive girl who tried to fabricate some white lies for the sophisticated role of David was very charming. I also find Vera's dance very, very well done. I am attracted to her toes as she pounced on stage without effort and without problems. <br /> <br /> For those who have had enough profane movies today, they will enjoy this film thoroughly.
