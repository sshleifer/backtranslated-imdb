I always tell people that "Abril Encantado" is a movie for adults without bad words, without sex and without violence. You might think it's "the best movie for girls", but I bet there are one or two enlightened men who love it too. However, do not invite children. This movie is very discreet. <br /> <br /> See "Abril Encantado" is a very healing experience. The soundtrack and the beautiful landscapes, together with the gentle manners of the ladies, remind us of the peace and beauty of a pre-Raphaelite painting. <br /> <br /> So that no one thinks that theirs really only sees one type of movie, I will paraphrase a line I once heard on "Saturday Night Live" and say that my two favorite movies are "The Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April".
