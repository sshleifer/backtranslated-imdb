Gandhi My Father is a well-made movie. It represents very well the life of Gandhiji's eldest son, Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to fend for himself, his failure, his ego ... Akshaye Khanna fully justifies the role of Harilal. Just not him, everyone did well in the roles they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhiji on screen I have ever seen. But I will cut three points, since there were some deficiencies. <br /> <br /> First, the movie was fifteen twenty minutes longer than it should be. Second, the film needed more research on the character of Harilal. Somewhere, the character seemed incomplete. Also, his relationship with his brothers was not shown. No other son of Gandhiji was mentioned in the whole movie. I think the character like Harilal should have at least some differences with his brothers too, considering the selfish nature of Harilal. <br /> <br /> Anyway, despite some shortcomings, I liked the movie. Recommended...
