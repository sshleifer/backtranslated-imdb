This was one of the first CREEPY movies I saw ... I was 5 years old at that time. It scared me good! But that night I put the gum in one eye to be like the monster ... and my mother got very upset. She had to wipe my eyes with alcohol and the next day, my eye smelled like DOUBLE MINT! NOW IT'S A MOVIE! Hey, it's time for it to be a great movie. That head sitting on the counter in the lab was as real as it was back then. And if your 5 is very scary! The children of today are ruined by special effects that show too much and leave NOTHING to the imagination of their mind. Your mind can imagine more frightening things than special effects! (IMO)
