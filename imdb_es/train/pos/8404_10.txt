['A simple entry movie, but of good character, on a good-humored but simple high school graduate who dreams of having the coolest personalized van in the world to use as his &quot;ballroom&quot;. <br /><br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all his savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams. The fact of sharing together and making love starts quickly with the girls that Bobby has picked up at the local pizzeria, but discovers that there is a lot of responsibility, danger and pain to be the owner of such a mechanical wonder. <br /><br /> The Van is a guilty pleasure of mine. He captures the relaxed atmosphere in the mid-&#39;70s and has enough involuntary humor to put him in the &quot;as bad as it is good&quot; category.']
