'Holes' was a GREAT movie. Disney made the right decision. All the people I've talked to about it said they LOVED it. All the participants were fit for the part they had, and Shia Labeouf really has a future with acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, she was exactly as he had imagined it. To all those who have not seen it, I recommend it and I guarantee that we will 'Say it'.
