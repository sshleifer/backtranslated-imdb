I think this movie is very beautiful. It's more like Michael Jackson or not, but if you like it, you have to watch this movie. I think it's a very neat movie with a great reproduction of songs and a good imagination. Not to mention the Smooth Criminal movie center piece, which has some of the best dances you'll see.
