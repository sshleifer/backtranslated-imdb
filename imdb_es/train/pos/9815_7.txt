Being the first full-length film with Robert De Niro (although it was not released in later years), it is worth seeing. The role of De Niro is not huge, but it is fun as one of the two friends who first try to avoid the marriage of other friends only to then persecute and force him to do so. Anyone who is a Die Hard fan of Die Hard, will be happy with an early performance by the best actor of today.
