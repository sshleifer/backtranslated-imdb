First of all, I would like to point out that I have not read the book, so there was no possibility that I would be disappointed in that aspect. The main defect that I detected was the historical detail, with several cars, trains, clothes, etc. I think they do not belong at that moment. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the film is fine, nothing to brag about. But the performance, I think, was great. I have no experience in acting, I still can not believe how people can consider this so terrible! Maybe they've only seen two movies (ever), and the other must have been very good! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons, and I really understood his character, someone who climbed the social ladder with hard work, then fought against those who would take away the work of his life, only he He is so involved in this fight, he does not realize that reason is no longer at his side, and he ends up being a beaten and disappointed man. Irons made this believable, sympathetic to the character despite his brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic woman, who is drawn to the revolutionary ideals of her boyfriend (Banderas, had an underdeveloped part, I think), and Glenn Close also It was very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, it just did not live up to the other actors. Be careful with Miguel Guilherme, an excellent Portuguese actor, among so many stars. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the movies of today, here only the interpretations, only the people matter, but at the same time, it is not a pretension. Film, too worried trying to be intellectual. The best proof that I really liked, I'm writing a review 7 years later.
