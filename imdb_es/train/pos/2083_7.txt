This movie was an interesting Hollywood take on the novel of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some nowadays think that it is full of racial stereotypes, so far the very idea of ​​the Chinese protagonists was progressive in itself. I discovered that the white actors who played the Chinese were not as bad as I expected, that it was not the Asian equivalent of the black face. Back then, there really was not any Asian actor in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with his part. It was not the best performance I've seen in my life, but for the interpretation of the old school it was nice. The lobster scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the premiere moment during the Great Depression turns this movie into an allegory. Especially the political turmoil that baffles the peasants and how they seem to be left behind by all this. <br /> <br /> The film had some parallels with the style of John Ford, but I think the Eastern influence also affected it. . If this had been a Western family, the lobsters would have won in the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson, then wins.
