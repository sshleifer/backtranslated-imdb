Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer pursued by the FBI. When agent Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer is his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks for some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life, from his childhood. They were a simple family of three: his widowed father Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of God had visited him and assigned him to his family to destroy the demons. What happens next is one of the most terrifying movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I saw it again, now on DVD. Although it is a low budget movie, the script is clear, without flaws. The cast is outstanding, but I would like to highlight the performance of Matt O'Leary as the young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role that a young teenager should perform. The direction of Bill Paxton is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this film: 'A Mão do Diabo' (The Devil's Hand). If at least it were 'The hand of God', it could be acceptable. But calling this movie "the hand of the devil" is really ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the screenwriter, did not deserve such disrespect on the part of the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("The hand of the devil")
