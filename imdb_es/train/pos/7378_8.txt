After seeing this movie last night at Sundance, I realized that a lot of Nakata's style was made for the first time in this movie. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media is the source of the supernatural. Instead of the damn video tape, instead, we have an enchanted study and weird images that appear in the movie. In fact, the strange images that appear in the film immediately remind us of the cursed video tape in RINGU. The only thing missing is the obsession with water that runs through Nakata's latest films. The final scenes are quite chilling, with a bit of assent to Murnau, which with the door opening alone and the ghost entering the room, reminds me immediately of <br /> <br /> NOSFERATU. A chilling movie that will make you think twice before climbing on a catwalk.
