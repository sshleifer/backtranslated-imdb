It's fine, let's be honest. This is a horrible movie of God. The plot (as it is) is horrible, the performance is worse. But the movie was made for one reason and only one, like all those horrible movies of Mario Lanza ... only to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti at his best. Well, maybe Lanza's films were also an excuse for him to hit the women, but this movie is about listening to Luciano. That's just why it's worth watching the movie. A great star of the opera faces his fears, finds humility and love along the way, and also has many successes. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I have prejudices on several levels. . I'm italian. I'm a big fan of Pavarotti (is there anything about Pavarotti that is not big, including his fan base?). And when I saw this movie for the first time, I went out on my own, seeing the height and depth of life's possibilities and falling in love for the first time. So, as horrible as this movie is, the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe life and love deeply again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's corny and horrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it is about. So I give this film a high rating with the hope that someone who has never listened to Pavarotti before will listen, see and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since he is no longer there. Like the Italian food you've never tasted, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised, like a Luciano lover or a future Pavarotti peep.
