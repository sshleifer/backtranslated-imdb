first, someone mentioned here that because it was published in a "limited" amount it means that it MUST be bad ... that's exactly what the "big five" Hollywood studios would like everyone to think so they can "approve" or "ignore" "characteristics that are not desirable, without losing face or image, directly censoring them to the point, this production has been released" limited "because certain people consider it" unpatriotic ". <br /> <br /> Now I loved this feature, I find it much better than "Charlie Wilson's War", even if it is a "fictional" account of something that "never" happens, but it is always so OBVIOUS. Or affected by current foreign policies of the United States. "Or" on board. " the country "turakistan" and "the emerald city" are definitely trying to look like Iraq and Baghdad as much as the corporation "Tamerlane" likes "haliburton" (with vice president Dan Aykroyd playing Dick Cheney, LOL). Quiet a time when the movie is VERY DEAD, not even sarcastic (the main example would be how the character of John Cusack deals with his depression, but not only). <br /> <br /> I found that ALL the characters can be related to something / someone or with specific stereotypes. now word of advice; If YOU are not politically active, especially in the aspects of "globalization", you probably do not enjoy much of this feature since most of its content and "jokes" are directed to certain "personalities" that are not "visible" "for the general public on daily bases ... (the main exception would be Hilary Duff, who plays the well-known pop star materialist, is it necessary to say the name (S)?). In its NUCLEUS, the characteristic is an antiglobalization concert, period. The message is delivered unequivocally with comic vengeance. Joan has a sentence at one point that reads: "And here we have a book written by you that knows who, about how I conquered the world and solved problems with my father" .PRICELESS))) <br /> <br /> Sister and brother Cusacks play well together as always, just as in "Grosse PointeBlank" I would say a little more "mature" .Marisa Tomeihere does not show her ass and her breasts to "impress" us (as she did recently in "Before the devil know you're dead "), but instead she has a very serious role and manages to carry it out in silence. <br /> <br /> Many critics do not understand it (they can not do it), or do not want to). This is NOT a "regular" movie but rather a comic documentary. this feature is used to send a message and NOT to get the Oscars, or have "visual" images for the viewer to buy the latest "HDTV" TVs with experience ... I have even noticed in my local newspapers that this movie becomes bad -views because it is not "artistic", while Iraq's war films in PRO look good for being "balanced" apparently and "attractive". It makes one wonder how much of the world's mainstream media are concentrated in the hands of a group of men. .. <br /> <br /> I bet that this feature will be a success abroad and much more than in North America. as I mentioned before, it's all a satire about US foreign policy and how it has been hijacked by "special interest" groups ... having the "regular" American soldier wearing the corporate logo "Tamerlane" in his combat suit is quite insulting BUT EFFECTIVE in showing reality as it is, or it will soon be the way things will come until now. <br /> <br /> some PRICELESS shots: after the "liberation", the country is invaded by commercial announcements; a hilarious scene about how future journalists are likely to compile "news" ("anything has to be better than this ox-box"))); Soldiers grappling with their "frustration"; <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend it to "conservative" or "hard" patriots of some kind or another. This characteristic is not designed to reach the "minds of the souls" of the people (as general propaganda and commercial interests always try to do it.) Instead, it contains a well-defined message for the realists, and towards some ideological objectives. , apparently "always" without realizing it.
