Legend of Dragoon is one of those little-known games that people love or hate. Some people claim that it is too similar to other games, such as the Final Fantasy series, which is understandable, since it was originally meant to be the equivalent of Sony's Final Fantasy. Honestly, I can not comment on the similarities beyond that, since I'm not very familiar with FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system. Not only do you have the ability to change to a more powerful dragon form, but every time you attack, you must pay attention to complete the attack by pressing the buttons at the correct time. Not only that, sometimes enemies will attack you right back in the middle of a sequence, which means you have to press different buttons to avoid receiving damage. Even the use of certain attack elements requires a bit of button combination. If you do not want to attack, you can always protect, which not only reduces the damage received by half, but increases your hit points without the use of healing potions. <br /> <br /> The FMV are pretty good. Done, almost the same quality as Final Fantasy 8's. However, the graphics during the game are not up to the task. They are nice, but they could have been, and honestly, they should have been, better. The translation also leaves something to be desired. Not only does it generate interesting questions about the relationship of the characters, but there are also some grammatical errors that simply should not have happened. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found interesting is that you lose the main characters of the game-- One dies, and the other basically becomes useless for the party and goes away. While it is often said that the death of a character makes no sense, it makes you realize that the characters, while the heroes, are still as deadly as the next person. The people who replace the lost characters simply get all their statistics, so the transition game is pretty simple. Perhaps my only complaint about the characters is the love interest of the main character, Shana. She is the personification of the defenseless woman who needs to be rescued, pathetic to the point of leading a player to scream in frustration. Although you can use it in your group, it is incredibly weak. I do not even know how his dragon powers are, since I did not like it so much that I never used it. The character Rose, on the other hand, is probably my favorite female character in any game in history. She is not weak, and some of her dragon magic is extremely useful. Meru is also quite strong, although sometimes he is an annoying chatty brat. <br /> <br /> The character designers were, like most, inclined to make the female characters look pretty or whatever, and did not think much. to the real usefulness of the suits. Seriously, no armor and having most of your exposed skin is not useful when you fight monsters. But I will give them accessories, since they have women who serve as gentlemen in different countries. <br /> <br /> I can not comment much on the plot, since I honestly did not pay much attention to it. where I needed to go to the next. I'm not sure if this says anything about the plot itself, or about my style of play. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a very nice game. It has its flaws, but for me it had the right balance of having to think and just press buttons and kill monsters.
