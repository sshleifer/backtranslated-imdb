I'm usually not too involved in a specific program (except for The OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!), But no kidding, after an episode of Reunion, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> I can not even say how annoyed I was that the time slot came into conflict with Bush's speech the night before because he was waiting for the 1987 episode, which will now be broadcast next Thursday. Once again, that conflict was disadvantageous because, being a new program, it needs to accumulate followers and, if the second episode is delayed by a week, some momentum is lost. <br /> <br /> That said, television does not always have Ser Emmy worthy of being nice. I do not expect Reunion to take home any prizes, but I do hope it can catch my attention throughout the season. Have you ever seen the first episodes of a beloved show years later? Sometimes you wonder how you ever got hooked. The creation of characters takes some time. <br /> <br /> The only episode of each annual idea is wonderful, in my opinion. The only other program I can remember doing something similar is 24, with each episode an hour ... and having a year full of events is more realistic than a day so full of events! Please, give this show a try. Relax on the art form ... it's just TV!
