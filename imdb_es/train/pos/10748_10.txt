I must say that the events of September 11 did not affect me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to face the devastation. I was the one who was changing the station on the radio and the channel on television if there was talk about the towers. I was tired of hearing about that. When this was broadcast on television one year and one day later, I was whimpering. It was the first time he had cried since the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I'm watching it now on TV, 5 years later, and I'm still crying because of the tragedies. The fact that it contains one of the only video shots of the first plane that hits the tower is amazing. It was an accident, and look where it took them. These two brothers make me want to be there to help.
