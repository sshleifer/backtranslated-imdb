The best way for me to describe Europe, which is at the top of the list of my favorite films, is the exclamation that came from a partner after the film ended: "I did not know that movies could be made like that". Completely original in its visual style, it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It is as far from the "master and cover" shot style as can be obtained; Integrating to perfection many layers of image, sound, effects, accessories, dialogues, voice-overs, interpretation, editing, lighting, etc ... all the same, none predominant. Despite the myopia of Hollywood "dialogue", cinema has nothing to do with dialogue, or with beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best when all the elements are on an equal footing, where ONLY the MIX of these elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of an element, and the movie has no meaning. "Europe" is what the cinema should strive to be.
