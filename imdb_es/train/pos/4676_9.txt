I found this provocative film and its refreshing ambiguity in a world of fast movies where we are manipulated to love the "good boy" and hate the "bad guy". Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a great job portraying the black sheep / lost child family that aspires to win the love and respect of his father, as well as that of his sister-in-law widow with whom she apparently has a history . Judd Hirsch plays against his usual image of a good boy as a father who triangulated his children and now stays with the one he always rejected. <br /> <br /> When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I loved the beautiful way that sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as the director explained. <br /> <br /> This is an appropriate successor to the classic "Ordinary People". I just realized that Judd Hirsch was also in that!
