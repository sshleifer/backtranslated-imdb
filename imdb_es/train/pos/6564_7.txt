['Jake Speed (1986) was a fun parody of Indiana Jones and other adventurer movies that were popular during the eighties. Wayne Crawford plays Jake Speed, an adventurer who is always fighting against evildoers wherever he goes. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) they trotted in search of action (and some decent story lines). The duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins) whose sister has been kidnapped by an evil trader of white slaves (John Hurt). Can you find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her rescue her sister? <br /><br /> A corny and cheesy movie that does not pretend to be something it is not. I have to give him a recommendation. That&#39;s if you like movies that like to have fun and for those that do not take everything seriously. <br /><br /> Recommended.']
