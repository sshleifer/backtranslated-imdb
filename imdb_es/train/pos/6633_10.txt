The first movie ever made. Workers who flow from a factory, some by bicycle, most of them walking, moving to the right or left. Along with Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and the starting point for the cinema: with Melies begins the narrative fiction, the cinema, the fantasy, the artifice, the spectacle; With the Lumieres pure, without embellishments, observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who lament the ossification of the cinema of the latter to the tired formulas of the former. <br /> <br /> But consider this again. There is nothing "objective" about it. The film is full of action: a static and inhuman scene bursts into life, activity and the silent harmony of the picture breaks, descends from the back to the right or the left (but never, of course, the front, where is the camera). ). And, nevertheless, the camera remains immobile, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. The cinematograph can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes: to trace the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it. <br /> <br /> worse is the historical reality of the movie. These workers at the factory are Lumiere employees. Bosses are spying on their workers, the invisible eye with respect to their faceless henchmen. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the doors, workers are confined to their workplace. The opening of the door seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, that limits them even more. The first film is also the first example of surveillance by CCTV, an image of an invisible authority that sees everything trapping its servants. A terrifying movie, too prophetic.
