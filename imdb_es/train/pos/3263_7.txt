Usually, I really enjoy movies like "Chances Are", but I was not very satisfied with this for several reasons. The first half was pretty good overall, with Alex Finch dying and reincarnating in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and his friend (Ryan O'Neal) and their daughter, who is now of legal age. The scenes in which they meet again and Downey rediscovers who they were before are well done, and there is a good deal of excitement and happiness once Shepherd finally believes that he is really her reincarnated husband, but from there the movie goes downhill . There are several scenes related to sex that discouraged me completely, especially Downey and Shepherd who wanted to meet again despite the difference in their age now. After that, however, the film manages to finish in the most satisfactory way possible, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral for the end. There was great potential with this story, and the scenes in heaven are well done. There is a good song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but in the end the movie is not great. For a better, similar movie, try "Heaven can wait." Decent, but I really wish I had not seen him because of the scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
