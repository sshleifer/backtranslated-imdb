William Wyler should have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's successful play on Broadway with music / poster recruitment, but his own military commitments intervened and addressed a very unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The "director of women" has a sure touch in the numerous documentary sequences of Air Corps training, and invests it in a more outlandish humanity than the genre generally allows, particularly in times of war. Of course, the rookie group (and entirely white, except for a non-hired Chinese-American recruit) are kinder and healthier than in real life, and the words about the home and about the mother, wife and son are pretty complicated, but it is propaganda efficient and undeniably moving. Remarkable, too, for the all-male military cast, several of which did not resurface for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Taylor. Also for a very early view of Judy Holliday, who does not appear up to an hour and a half in the picture, but has some small good sequences as the wife of Brooklyn, who is sick with worry, O'Brien. Too bad that their rights are tangled and the only impression that is known is 16 mm; Evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox launched it (with considerable success), the rights returned to the Army, and if there is a good 35mm impression, it is probably somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It is fake and corny in some places, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and deserves to be seen more widely.
