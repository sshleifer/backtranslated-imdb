He saw this as a naive young punk when he was first released. I let myself smell like a baby when I left the theater, trying not to let anyone see. Then, when I saw him again now in 2007, I knew what to expect and the sobs were ready and prepared as the required moment approached. Fortunately, this time I was at home. <br /> <br /> What I did not remember about my youthful vision, or maybe I had not realized that, was the technical brilliance of this film. The use of flashbacks that tell so much history without resorting to dialogue. The camera work that seemed to place the viewer, along with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe crosses the street to the restaurant, the camera moves behind the woman and the child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself, and the characters: sordid, sad and brutally real. It is very moving to be trapped so closely in a human drama like this with people that most of us would probably reject. On the other hand, Joe and Ratso could be any of us. It must have been '70 when I saw it. I remember that when they left the theater they encouraged me to find the company of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is a great movie.
