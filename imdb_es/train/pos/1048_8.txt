For Muslim women in West Africa, married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very difficult. The community may not explicitly endorse such behavior, but equally, they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal, an attitude that, of course, allows it to continue. Fortunately, the letter of the law of Cameroon promises equality for all, and this documentary follows the real life exploits of several practitioners in the legal system of Cameroon while trying to obtain justice for several women and children. What is remarkable (aside from the uplifting central story) is how, despite their informality, the courts are actually pragmatically progressive, if a case is bought. The program also offers a fascinating insight into the entire Cameroonian lifestyle, which (apart from the horrible crimes committed in the cases presented) seems incredibly emotional and cheerful compared to that enjoyed by the inhabitants of Europe or North America. And while I acknowledge that this comment may betray my naivety, this attitude seems to be captured in the delicious pidgin-English they speak. In general, this is a fantastic movie, and much more fun to watch than you imagine.
