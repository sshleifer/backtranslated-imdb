Good story fun and simple, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies in which he is). This was a good "vehicle" for someone expert in comedy and drama, as there are elements of both. A romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories, big closing lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good at another good, but unpopular romantic comedy ("Truth about Cats & Dogs"). Maybe they are too implausible. Ebert did not even publish a review for this. The big "screwball" comedies were obviously totally unlikely ("Bringing up Baby", etc.). If you've seen an improbable comedy, have you seen them all? Or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s. Strange. Birthday Girl is a movie that I have enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman can be the "killer app" for home videos.
