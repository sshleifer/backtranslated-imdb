I was too young to know much about the prince, but in recent years I have seen many Purple Rain Novelty shirts and thought they were great, but I did not want to buy a shirt I did not know anything about. So one Saturday the fuse came and I decided to see it. I did not know what the movie was going to be before I saw it, but it was great once I discovered it. In the film, the prince was not known as a prince, but as "the child". All the performances were great for me, but my favorites were Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I would die for you. All the songs related to what was happening throughout the film when his mother and father were always fighting the song when the pigeons cried described what he was feeling. I also like how smart the prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia. I liked it when Prince and Appallonia met for the first time at the club and he stood behind her and then, once he turned around, he disappeared! great movie and now I can not even find one of those shirts :(
