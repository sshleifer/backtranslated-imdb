Good show <br /> <br /> The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. There is a set of moral dilemmas that they face. Humanity has made a series of technological advances, but is humanity mature enough to deal with its new toys? There is moral decadence in a virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. I predict (based on the background of BSG) that there will be a problem with the Cylons and slavery. In addition to this, there are all the other problems that we humans pose. <br /> <br /> This program is not BSG, at least not to the extent that humanity is fleeing from a ruthless problem that was ultimately their own creation. Nor are there many special effects based on shots or in space, at least not in the first episodes I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> What it does have are very good stories, characters and themes. It also has good performances from the actors. They can create a culture similar to that of modern society, but at the same time, be completely credible. Like BSG, this program is about humanity: our strengths, weaknesses, potential and failures. It may seem a bit strange that a human society in a different set of worlds has ties, old cars and chicken. But those things are really more to create a semi-familiar fund than anything else. Anyone who gets stuck in those details is really missing the point. Whether it belongs to a mafia-style culture or a rich, high-tech culture, humans and human nature are not so different 150,000 years ago from a high-tech past of what we see today in the world. I wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.
