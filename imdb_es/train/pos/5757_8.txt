This movie could only originate in the 70s! It's a strange action movie set in a small city of California workers. Some kind of mill or plant is closing, so suddenly, bad behavior is happening on the streets! The townspeople are fed up! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent), goes to another city to recruit his brother, Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnam veteran who looks and acts a little out of balance. He joins a group of other Vietnam veterans. They come to the city to clean it (they become delegates), but under their good deeds, they are actually running gambling houses, asking for protection money, etc. It takes time for people to understand, and in a biblical confrontation with Cain and Abel, Vincent has to face his older brother. There is an interesting sleazy blue collar atmosphere in this movie, which makes it interesting (watch the cockfight scene!). Vincent is almost too angelic in this role? he thinks so well of his brother that he can not conceive that he commits the evil deeds of which he is accused. Does it finally reach your senses? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in the back and he is beaten at home. Kris Kristofferson is incredibly effective as Aaron. He coldly denies doing anything wrong, and even lulls him gently and talks to Vincent's young daughter (she refers to him as 'Uncle Aaron'), even while threatening his father's life, while smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have a good chemistry of contrast to each other. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a "parlor" girl that draws Aaron's attention. This is a good action movie from the 70s, if you can find it! NOT available on DVD yet?
