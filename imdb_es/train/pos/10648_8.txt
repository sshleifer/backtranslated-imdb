What can I say that has not been said about "The Haunting"? It has everything that would make a great image. Wonderful sets, whimsical music and sound design to die for were in place. However, the script sometimes surprises the mind in such a strange and surreal way. The whole team must have forgotten to read it, maybe because they were too busy creating CG effects and building Gothic sets to realize how weak the plot was. Each member of the cast gives a decent performance, although with little conviction of the material in question. Lili Taylor has more to do, while others react to her. But that's it. All I can say is that it was a pleasant two hours, but I will definitely want more. Much more.
