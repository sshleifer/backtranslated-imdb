The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is really a good movie. He has a good performance by the cast including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong's music is creepy and gives that diabolical chill! I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns, with ruffles as part of its neck and it acted really slimy. If you like horror movies and have not seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and are able to find and buy this rare movie and then do it because it is a good movie and I think you will not be disappointed.
