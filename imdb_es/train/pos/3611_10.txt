I watched this movie after watching Blue Crush and other Michelle's movies, I thought I had a bleak future in this business. I was extremely mistaken after seeing her performance in "Girlfight" I was surprised at the way she captures the emotion of one. a fighter, but also a warrior. In this film the way she confronts her father about the treatment she and her brother are dealing with, the way she transmits anger when they hit her. His learning curve of the characters in the film can not always put a wall and hide from love, or simply because he has power, he will not win. I think that this role was perfect for Michelle, although I had no previous experience, the director saw talent, I criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her.
