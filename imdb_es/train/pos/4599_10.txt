This is my favorite movie by Jackie Chan and in an interview, Jackie said it was also her favorite. It contains some incredible tricks and amazing fight sequences, as well as some very funny scenes too. This movie was the favorite of Brandon Lee, who used parts in Rapid Fire, and was also raised in Tango and Cash, who used some of the opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays a policeman in Hong Kong. The story immediately launches into a fantastic chase through a shantytown and continues as Jackie slides downhill and gets on a moving bus to catch the evil Ku (who is one of the greatest villains in any movie of Jackie Chan). Very funny scenes while Jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girlfriend, played by Maggie Chung. His job is to protect Ku's secretary who has enough information to knock him down, but even that raises many problems. Jackie is at her best here. The last fight scene in the mall is my favorite fight scene of all - period. It was the most intense fight I've ever seen Jackie and reaches her climax in a slide down a pole amid explosive lights. All in all, one of his best acrobatics he ever did and left with his hands open. He was lucky not to be electrocuted, since the person in charge of the trick used high voltage instead of a lower voltage. <br /> <br /> In general, another classic from Chan and definitely one of his best films. At the end of this movie, it can be said that he did not contain anything at all and neither did his doubles. So many of his doubles were injured during this movie that no one would assure them anymore, Jackie had to take responsibility. No tricks, cables or accessories; It is a real life action that is a pleasure to see. It is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that is and is a film that will surprise people within 100 years. If you have not seen this movie and are a fan of Jackie Chan or the action in general, give yourself a treat and watch this movie. It is truly sensational.
