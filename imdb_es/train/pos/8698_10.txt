I saw this movie at its launch and I have treasured it ever since. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find casting as one of the most interesting aspects of a movie). I really enjoyed seeing the dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role, and Wallace Shawn is always a hoot. The script is smart, cunning and ironic, making fun of almost everything "Beverley Hills". I loved the "doctor" of Paul Bartel and the servant of Ray Sharkey. This was rude and crude, but thank God! Unless you're rude, I recommend this movie. For your information for anyone who likes to play six grades of Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel were at "Rock & Roll High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were together in "The Night of the Comet". It was the three of them in "Comer Raoul".
