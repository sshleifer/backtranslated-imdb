This is a beautiful movie visually. The images of the Mexican desert, the old mansion, the characters in their colorful costumes ... everything is a true work of art. <br /> <br /> The story seems a little loose, but that's because it's not meant to be realistic It was taken from a book called One Hundred Years of Solitude, and it's supposed to be an evocation of the isolated atmosphere and another world of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States". The tremendous debt that Erendira owes her grandmother is a symbol of the burden of Latin America's international debt, although there are many layers of meaning. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate a film with slow movement and rich texture, this is for you.
