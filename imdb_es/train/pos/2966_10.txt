BASEketball is awesome! It's hilarious and very funny that you wet the pants laughing. I've seen it so many times that I stopped counting. But every time it becomes more fun. <br /> <br /> Trust me in this case ... BASEketball is a sure success and I loved it and will continue to love it. I hope someday a special edition DVD will be released! <br /> <br /> Ten thumbs up!
