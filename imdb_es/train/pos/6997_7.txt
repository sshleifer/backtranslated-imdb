One thing is for sure ... you should not watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin he can not handle. The story is fed by drip instead of the usual explanation for what makes you wonder what is going on. Finally, the points come together and the actions make sense. All the characters were fine and Wil Smith made another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that there are many moral questions that must be asked, but if you only accept and support them in their agony, it is easier. to accept what you have chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey that takes you is interesting enough, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A good enough movie that, unfortunately, leaves you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the guy you have to think about and not just see explosions and fights.
