The incursion of Takashi Miike into the territory of the children won me almost immediately because he shows nerves and courage when dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a child, I thought there was something sinister about most fairy tales; Horrible things happen to most children's books. Miike understands that these classic stories are a little more frightening (and more disturbing) than they appear at first sight. The filmmaker takes the archetypal story of a child in a wonderful search outside the preschool classroom. It accentuates the real fears of a world full of endless dangerous missions. Westerners like to minimize the seriousness behind sleeping stories written specifically for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of history, but also shows signs of restriction. But a self-possessed Miike is even stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended
