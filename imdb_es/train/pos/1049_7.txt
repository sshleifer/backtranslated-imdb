['The sisters-in-law will be released theatrically on March 24 in Sweden. A good opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in Gothenburg along with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, &quot;focus director&quot; of the festival. She gave a master class, very appreciated, telling her method as a documentary maker and told the audience the special circumstances that led her to shoot the sisters-in-law twice: the first version was lost forever, so a second shoot was organized. The movie turned out to be different in the end. In this case, a rather horrible problem occurred to create the possibility of a very strong film.']
