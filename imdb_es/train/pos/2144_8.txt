A sweet and totally charming movie, Shall We Dansu? It made me laugh and cry At the first appearance, Sugiyama-san was not terribly attractive: a tense hired hand, apparently devoted to his family, but very easily captivated by a face in a window. The object of his obsession is distant and cold. But at the end of the film, I was in love with him, with her, with his wife and daughter, with all the instructors and dance students. This story without complications of transformation and renovation is a little gem that I would like to see again.
