God! Zorro has been the subject of as many films as Tarzan, and probably had more actors in the lead role. <br /> <br /> This series is one of my personal favorites, and as stated above, it is one of the 5 best sound series. Oddly enough, this is a production that premiered in that year of water in 1939. * At the time of this production in '39, Zorro was actually known as a literary and cinematographic character (Pulp). The film begins with a short note on the history of Mexico's struggle for the freedom of government of a European monarchy, namely Spain. History invites comparison with the War of the American Revolution. <br /> <br /> History concentrates its attention on the mythical Province of San Mendelito and its "Council". He is being approached by Benito Juárez ** about the relationship of his gold mine with the new Republic of Mexico. Gold shipments must reach Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Uncle Don Francisco to Diego Vega, states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoys. A thug from the Don of the Golden Mafia, becomes an "insult" and challenges Don Francisco to a duel with swords, Don Frasncisco runs. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the masked dark-masked swordsman appears to the sword fight and after carving the "Z" mark on the bad boy's face, he dispatches it to the beyond.Don Francisco declares with his Last breath to his pupil Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew from the city of Los Angeles, he also tries to tell the true identity of Don del Oro, but he expires before completing the statement. <br /> <br /> There is a great reception for Diego at the Hacienda de Don Francisco, where Diego disappoints Ramon'sister (also from Don Francisco's room) with his shy act "A FOP!", Declares. <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon sneak off to join a volunteer meeting, when they ask: "Who will take us with Don Francisco now dead?", Ramon declares: "Fox, we are the Legion of Fox Fight!" Well, There is a great battle with the Legion, now dressed in gray, with masks and capes, protecting the Golden Train. he seems caught in an avalanche made by man destined for the convoy, when, well, you know, the end of Chapter One. Suspense. <br /> <br /> Wow! That was a lot of writing for a chapter, but like most other serial publications, the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to set the story. Suffice it to say that there are 11 better chapters, well done and full of action. <br /> <br /> FOX'S LEGION OF COMBAT has all the elements that contributed to the action of the upper suspensory. We have an unknown evil leader who is encouraging problems between different groups. There are a number of suspects as to who was really behind the "Don del Oro" mask. We had soldiers, renegade whites, hostile Indians and the Legion. <br /> <br /> In summary, it is safe to say that there is everything one could want, and then some, in this Series. And, by the way, they choose wisely that the actors do not affect the Mexican accent. <br /> <br /> As to what is here that makes ZFL stand out from the rest? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First, it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score that highlights drama and action on the screen. The opening theme appears even in a flamenco guitar performance in the Cantina in Chapter One. This is probably the only time such a specialized innovation appears in the serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> And yet, there is one more feature that really puts the Fighting Legion saga in front of all the others. That is, the film not only has a heroic musical theme, but also includes lyrics, yes, the Legionaires sing! We heard them sing in the opening credits and in several chapters! It really works well and adds to the feelings we get from visualization. <br /> <br /> When the series was first shown on our local television (around 1955), the whole gang immediately recognized the voice of Reed Hadley as Belonging to 'Captain Braddock of RACKET SQUAD, the series of TV. Mr. Hadley had a very distinctive and profound voice. *** He also handled the paper very well. His suit and especially the elongated mask looked great and was probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a small slip up. A kind of minor anachronism occurs when Benito Juárez (Carleton Young) addresses the San Mendelito Council, since Juarez was 18 at that time (1824) and, although later he was perhaps the greatest figure in the history of Mexico Surely he had not yet reached such prominence. His inclusion in the story was probably to take advantage of the release of JUAREZ Warner Brothers that year, which starred Paul Muni in the lead role. <br /> <br /> This is not only my choice as one of the 5 best sound series, but also my favorite Fox movie. <br /> <br /> * We remember the great harvest of the best films of that year, what with GONE WITH THE WIND, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE CITIZEN, JUAREZ, THE WIZARD OF OZ, OF MICE AND MEN, ONE MILLION AC, ZENOBIA, WE WANT THAT OUR MOM will count among the results of that year. <br /> <br /> ** Once again, Juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850, some 25 years later. In addition, political subdivisions are referred to as "Provinces" in history. Actually, they are called 'states'. As we call ourselves the United States of America, also, south of the border, they call their Republic the United States of Mexico. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was prominent in some very 'A' images in which his richly toned voice is exploited with good results. See and hear his narration in THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
