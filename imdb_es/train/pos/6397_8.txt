I gave him an 8 star rating. It is possible that the story has fallen short in approximately 3/4 of the image, but the performances remained firm at all times. "Men of Honor" was changed from "Navy Diver", understandably. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that "Honor" is an appropriate word to use in the title.
