Before movies such as "The Texas Massacre", "Suspiria" and "Halloween" changed the vision of horror forever, there was a more Gothic and much less violent era in the genre. Movies like the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemary's Baby' were what scared and thrilled the public during the 60s and early 70s. I can not say how many times I rented this movie during my childhood, but I did it because there was something about it. I did not want to limit myself to slasher movies and zombies of the 70s and 80s and movies like this production of the famous, but unfortunately missing Amicus film company was a good start. <br /> <br /> Advantages: A great spooky music score. Strong performances by a stellar cast. Brilliant cinematography A lot of good old emotions and chills, especially in the first and last cartoons. Some disturbing moments and images. It moves at a slow, but steady pace. The house is a spooky and oppressive dwelling. Great production design and stage decoration, which give the film a sense of ancient Gothic horror. It depends more on the state of mind and the chills without blood than on the bloody and gratuitous nudity for their emotions. <br /> <br /> Cons: Some rhythm problems in the first half. Apart from 'The Cloak', the rest of the stories feel as if they had been done before. Clich√©s in abundance. The second story, 'Waxworks', has a good performance and its moments, but it is the weakest of the four in terms of fear and suspense. The low budget really shows up sometimes. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: After seeing this movie for the first time in many years, I can see why I rented it so often. It is not a masterpiece in any way, but it is a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. Look at this with the lights off. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
