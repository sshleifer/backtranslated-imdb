Normally, the best way to bother me in a movie is to include some reference to Orson Welles. But here's a sci-fi comedy that quotes the broadcast of The War of the Worlds ... and it's gold! The very concept that a small group of tiny, aggressive and stupid aliens get confused when children in Halloween dress is magnificent. Do not be fooled by the idea that, because it looks like a movie for children, it is not sophisticated, it is not, there are many hidden treasures ... A jewel!
