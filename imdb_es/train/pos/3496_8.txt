I'm surprised how many people give this movement less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they just do not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about growing up in a difficult situation. situation. <br /> <br /> There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there's a good reason why so many critics like this movie. <br /> <br /> And the reason is because they understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the low scores awarded by some people. <br /> <br /> I would like to be able to simply write a brief summary of a movie but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I have nothing more to say.
