I just saw Antwone Fisher in BRAVO. What an incredible movie and incredible young. This film is a must for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome the abuse and neglect of childhood as an adult. Denzel Washington presents an outstanding performance, as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alert: feel good and tearful. The most heartbreaking moment is when he finally meets his mother, who was taken away at 2 months of age. And one of the bravest was when he confronted his abusive adoptive mother and his sister. I saw this movie in Bravo in 2008 and I just wish I had known it years ago. Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection.
