This is the first to come out of the Guinea Pig series, and is one of the most infamous movies in the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to finally join my hands and get a copy of This notorious group of movies. I bought the guinea pig box game and decided to see the collection ordered by launch date. So I got this sucker and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I had read on the internet, and realizing the content involved in this movie, I hoped to test my nerves with all my might. This ended up not being the case. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin to torture her in hopes of discovering the human break point and the time a human can tolerate pain. . <br /> <br /> It sounds like a sick movie, right? Incorrect. The movie does not make an impact. This may be because I have become desensitized over the years because of my obsession with horror, but I think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could easily go through this. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, a person who does not know this type of movie well will probably feel overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen. Although I was not surprised, the film contains scenes of rather malicious and graphic violence. Including tearing the nails, intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle in the eye. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that for most of the gorehounds on this board, you should put your hands on a copy. of this film because of the novelty of it, but I suggest that for any new participant of this type of film, I should work on it.
