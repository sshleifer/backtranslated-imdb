This is one of my favorites, Mr. Motos, and I've seen them all. As usual, Lorre is his charming self, like Mr. Moto. Lionel Atwill plays a deliciously crazy museum curator, the usual comic relief is pretty fun here, and there are many suspects to take a look at. It's fast and fun. <br /> <br /> The archeologist does not have the same talent as Thomas Beck, the second habitual leader in these programmers, but it is adequate. Stepin Fetchit is on board, and while speaking in a stereotyped way, his lines are fun, not demeaning to his intelligence, and actually saves the day in his brief time on the screen.
