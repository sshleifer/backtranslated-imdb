A good movie with - for its moment - an intense, extensive, rather obscure story, somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's "The Searchers," though not so brutal. The story begins fast and does not stop, with several scenes of very good dialogue between Jeff Webster (Castillo de Ronda) and Sheriff Gannon (de Stewart). This film is, in a way, reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also a work by Mann-Stewart, but I found it much less sentimental and more interesting. There are some warnings: an end too fast (and rather sentimental) that ends; Corrine Calvert, 24 years old, is not very convincing as a naive French teenager and, of course, the film takes place in Mythic West, a land of fables where the real laws of nations and physics do not apply. But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, disconnected man who thinks he does not care about anyone other than himself, and that the mountainous landscape can not be overcome. A good western costume drama.
