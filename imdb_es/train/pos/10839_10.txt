['I discovered this movie in the video store a few years ago and I rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much that we bought the VHS and have enjoyed it since then. <br /><br /> The plot has been well discussed, so it is not necessary to revise it. The point is that this film deserves repeated viewings. Americans, especially, are not going to get all the jokes the first time. I know I did not. <br /><br /> This movie is funny, moving, sad ... all at the same time. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter&#39;s wedding, he is indifferent. When Karen calls Tony &quot;Brian&quot; when he tries to kiss her, it&#39;s heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it&#39;s too much fun for words. <br /><br /> And the music: it&#39;s as good as the soundtrack of a movie I&#39;ve heard in years. He was dancing in the living room with &quot;Around the world.&quot; <br /><br /> Each performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy has been rightly congratulated for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the adorable keyboard player who has carried a flashlight for Karen all these years. It has an attractive hanged-out appearance that makes women want to hug him. But all the actors are equally brilliant. <br /><br /> Ignore any image you have read about this movie and watch it. It is a jewel.']
