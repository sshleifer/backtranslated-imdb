If this movie had been made a few years later, it would have given him a lower score. However, by 1909, this was a small dandy movie and it still holds up pretty well today. Just do not try to compare this silent film with later silences: the industry changed so radically that the short films of the first decade of the twentieth century are nothing like the movies made in the 1910s and beyond. <br /> <br /> This movie lasts for 11 minutes (roughly the average of most movies at the time) and is a variation on the story of Edgar Allen Poe, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with the story, I will not explain it further, since I do not want to ruin the movie. It is enough to say that it is very scary!
