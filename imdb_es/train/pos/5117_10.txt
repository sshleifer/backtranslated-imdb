Very few films have had an impact on American culture as Urban Cowboy has done. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is almost in a class by itself as one of those movies that when you change channels at 3:00 AM, you can not just take your eyes off ... my top three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW but that's that's not the point. I remember that Urban Cowboy went to the cinemas and at night honkyton opened on every corner, men wore cowboy hats with their moccasins, and if they did not know how to do it, they were considered a social imbecile! Personally I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever. Who is a thunk? He is really believable too. The soundtrack is impressive. Too bad that Charlene Tilton, of Dallas television fame, ruined Johnny Lee's career because that guy was just fantastic. The spectacle thief here is Scott Glenn as the ex-oiler with peasant cowboy. And I have nothing against the ex-cowboys semi-oilers being one, but I've always envied what I feel is the greatest power line of all time ... "Pack-at S * # t!" Something like that like "make my day" of Clint. And seeing him slapping Sissy is the closest thing I'll see to my Julia Roberts fantasy, so ... Like I said, beautiful. 9/10
