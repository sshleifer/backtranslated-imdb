['&quot;I hate a minute&quot; is an incredibly beautiful movie. A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. The excellent performances and the excellent photography make this film a &quot;must see&quot; for any film student or horror fanatic. The reality of the story and the human side of Eric separate this film from other films of psychopathic murderers. Some shouts to the film&#39;s producer, Bruce Campbell, as well as to the movie &quot;The Evil Dead,&quot; add some humor to anyone who knows the genre.']
