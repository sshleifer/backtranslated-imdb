A true dark and black film and a very graphic film, a beautiful story of a man who seeks redemption, who may have left everything too late. Visually, there are some very good scenes artistically amazing in terms of what can be done with a minimum budget. A highlight for Gareth Maxwell Roberts and his team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although I hope more British actors are excellent. Lisa Ray looked lovely, I had not seen her before and I hope to see her again in the future. Subject to all interesting sex, drugs and violence. Go ahead. I would definitely say rent this and verify it if you're in the mood for a noir in a bad mood.
