I have seen this film for the second time to discover why it was not as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have been, and I discovered considerable artistic merit, which could ultimately have been its commercial ruin. <Br /> <br /> In the first place, this film tries serious science fiction, social commentaries, more than action-adventure. There is action in it, but it is not really about that. If you focus on that, you will end up with (as others have noticed) a bad "Aliens" clone. But, again, it's not about that. <br /> <br /> The film really is about Todd (Kurt Russell) transforming from human to almost machine and back to human (mostly * back *). But because he does not try to give you an answer to Hollywood style, Glurt, Kurt Russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions. And it really does a wonderful job: it can take two visits to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The "social logic" that surrounds it is flawed and is never adequately explained if Todd's ability to defend himself against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newborn discovered humanity or what, but the movie is still a wonderful showcase for Russell's talent (easy to underestimate).
