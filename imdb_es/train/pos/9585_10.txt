Wonderfully together. I wish there was a follow-up of this documentary to follow the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost ... there should be a part two ... a real one. It was great ... the movie was not long enough ... I would like to know why the creator of the movie did not follow up! this is so important for the community period ... well, if you're reading this, consider making another documentary of this kind ... I'm really tired of listening to naive writers how AIDS and Men come together when they do not . in fact, it is the hetero that we must analyze ... this movie did not even bother to mention HIV or AIDS, and I am very happy about that ... I really appreciated the breakdowns and the definitions. Thank you very much for allowing this movie to exist.
