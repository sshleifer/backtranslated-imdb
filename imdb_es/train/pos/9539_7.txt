For the fans of Troma or the genre Cyberpunk mixed with a little blood, this movie is for you! There is a good amount of blood spilled within the limits of this film, in addition the effects can be impressive and surprising. The plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not being chained to what we, as the expectant audience of the movies these days. <br /> <br /> The little aliens are also remarkable, which I thought were pretty. All in all, it is a good movie for fans of the genre. Also recommended are films like Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Versus for that strange approach to Japanese cinema, full of wonderful darkness and bloodshed. Of course, seeing this movie you should already have knowledge of both.
