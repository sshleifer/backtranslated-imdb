Some of those guys who watch movies and complain about them for a living are forgetting something: the DVD menu system. I tell people, I watched the main screen repeat itself about 35 times. It was incredible A cinematic tapestry of brilliance in cascade that took me from where I was, which was the beginning. Many times the sum and Bam! I got hooked. And again. And more. <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, doo de dodedo". And that's just the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I'm lying in bed, curled up with my Vaio. The rain is on the flat roof and soft tonight is soft again. The cat is comfortable and my ankle that crosses in me, is already rested. I got into the DVD. I was hypnotized. Overnight. "doot de doot, doo de dodedo". <br /> <br /> The Blob. Look at it. Steve Queen, two policemen and a girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
