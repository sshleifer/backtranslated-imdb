I thought that this movie was fantastic. It was hilarious A little reminded me of Spinal Tap. This is a must see for any rock fan of the 70s. (I hope my friends and I are not like that in twenty years!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the lead singer that deals to recover that old spirit, <br /> <br /> Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the film as the glue that tries to hold the band together, but without success. <br /> <br /> If you love music and you were always in a band, this movie is definitely for you. . You will not regret having seen this movie. I know not. Even my family found it funny, and that's saying something.
