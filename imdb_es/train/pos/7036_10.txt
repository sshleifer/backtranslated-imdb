I have to be one of the best political satires I've seen to date, with an excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei and all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Excellent argument, very well located and very good unexpected turn at the end. The action scenes were well filmed and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> In general, I give this movie a big nod. It is extremely critical of US military intervention. UU In the Middle East, and as such, it can receive bad reviews from people who do not share the same political opinion, or from those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate dark humor and drk. In fact, in some places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was on the borderline between the funny and the tragic.
