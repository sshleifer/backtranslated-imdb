I laughed so much during this movie that my face hurt. Ben Affleck was very funny and reminded me of a handsome boy, Jack Black, in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical performance in A. The whole cast is fun, the story pretty good and the comedic moments impressive. I went into this movie without expecting much, so maybe that's why I was so surprised to leave the movie completely complacent and exhausted. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and / or endure family members. The best part of this movie (for me anyway) were the subtle bits of humor that surprised me off guard and made me laugh long after the rest of the audience had stopped. Namely, the scene that involves the illumination of the Christmas tree. Go see it and have fun!
