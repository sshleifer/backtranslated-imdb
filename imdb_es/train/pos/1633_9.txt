I LOVED this movie when it came out in the 80s and I still do it. I still quote classic lines like "say it again" and "you said you would tear the balls from me, sir". Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it was underestimated and disowned by MAD, I have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that would take me if I sent it to a desert island. I just want someone to release the DVD because my VHS tape is worn out! If you like comedy cheesed, this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It's military humor in all the best and the worst! Rent it if you can not own it!
