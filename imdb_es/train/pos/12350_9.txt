I'm not sure how I missed this one when it came out, but I'm glad I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district in Okabasho, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based on the strength of Japan's samurai code. <br /> <br /> It's only Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before he could direct this film, his adaptation of the script is shown. His vision of the Japanese world and the caste system is recognized and sheds light on how these systems interact with each other. The characters can rotate around each other, but the caste system remains intact when each character returns to the world to which they belong. The samurai warrior who enters the world of the loving and loving prostitute returns to his life, while she embarks on another path with a man who is part of his caste system ... the lowest of the low. Many value the world of the samurai above all others, but even so, it is the inhabitants of the lower castes who can support each other and can love without restrictions. The samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one, while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher rating. It is a story of the survival of women in feudal Japan. During this period of time, it was thought that men were the survivors ... the strong ones, while it was thought that women were simply meaningless and weak property. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they had to do to survive, and how their strength allowed Japanese culture to continue as it has. <br /> <br /> I recommend "The sea is watching" to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if they are not fans. It is a charming, quiet and soul-sustaining movie, and one to be treasured by any movie collection.
