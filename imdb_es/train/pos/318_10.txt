This is without doubt the best movie ever made. It is almost incomprehensible even with many repeated visualizations in an attempt to find out exactly what is happening. The film was almost totally improvised and includes random musical numbers, commercials, contests that one enters by mail and many other innovations. Also, what other movies have appearances by Martin Luther King, Jr? To decipher the movie, look for the director's book I Was Curious. Everything will be clarified. It is a great and daring experiment in improvised recursive cinema. A triumph. Now, if someone were to make a version with the subtitles in a different * color * to the target ... the blank subtitles tend to disappear and become invisible.
