['I&#39;ve seen the freebird movie and I think it&#39;s great! It&#39;s fun and fun, it was time for the British film industry to come up with something entertaining! It&#39;s good how the guy who met them at the service station is mentioned in the movie in the news agents, a nice touch. The performance was convincing (I&#39;m a biker) that reminded me of some good times I&#39;ve had in the bicycle scene. It was good to see the film director enter the performance, well done, Jon! In the end, a new crop is mentioned, in Ireland, is this the basis for a second film? I hope they keep coming. Great movie, well written, realistic characters!']
