This is a docudrama story about the case of Lindy Chamberlain and a look at its impact on Australian society. In particular, it deals with the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectation when it comes to real-life dramas. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that history deals with is the way in which everyone is expected to give the same emotional response to similar situations. Not everyone gets into wild melodramatic hysteria at every major crisis. . The fact that the characters in movies and on television act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so. This is especially suitable for journalists and news editors who seem to be looking for the big sob scene that will bring out the ratings. It is a subject that must be addressed constantly. <br /> <br /> Drivers interpret characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are ably supported by a large cast, all game individuals based on facts. It is possible that some viewers are surprised to learn that many of the actors in this story are people better known in Australia as comic actors. It reinforces my idea that comic actors do some of the best props in dramas because with comedy they know how to set fast impressions of individuals. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here; in that I am actually an ex-Adventist who was a practicing member in Australia at the time of this incident; So I have a slightly different impression of history than most. I believe that it is handled with an amazing creativity and personality, and an emotional heart. I think the best scene is one in which the new helicopters harass the couple. He captured the themes of the story brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to "play the best case for their character that they could". While this is especially appropriate for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should apply to all actions.
