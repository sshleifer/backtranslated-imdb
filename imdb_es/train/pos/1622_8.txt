I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the cartoons of famous black artists ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson , Stepin Fetchit (however) Louis Armstrong and the choir girls are outside the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. It's true ... there are stereotypes, but that's how it was ... and these cartoons were an entertainment for adults in their local cinema before the main feature. <br /> <br /> The Harman & Ising cartoons used to be more "pretty" and more exclusive (after all ... we're talking about MGM) than the standard animated short performed in Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or humble Columbia. Even the very early Disney Mickey Mouse had a lot of barnyard humor before Uncle Walt cleaned it up just before it was "Technicolor". <br /> <br /> Disney also had some cartoons with cartoons of black artists ... for example, Silly Symphony of 1937 "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. In 50 years ... clips from the Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will also be analyzed, analyzed ... and even vilified by future viewers.
