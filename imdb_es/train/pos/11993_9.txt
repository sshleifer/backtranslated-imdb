Along with Darkwing Duck this is canceled unfairly. Disney has been in decline since Tarzan and we need a program like this to put Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (do you sound familiar?) The melody of the song is also catchy. Of all the villains, who are great on their own merits, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo actually sound very similar to the voice-overs in the Jungle Book, which is not bad at all. In fact, it is very inspiring! The animation was successful, and the script had a lot of wit that has lacked animation seriously for years. PLEASE BRING THIS SHOW 9/10. Bethany Cox
