['My observations: postwar hilarity. Tom Drake and the grandfather of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; two years later (the year I was born). Charming and pretty Donna Reed. Margaret Hamilton good as always; Part smaller than in &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;. Spring Byington is prettier, also with the requirement of a small and cheerful nose of Hamilton. The carp scene at the end with the ex boy next door was hilarious. As a two-year veteran in army tents, he looked pretty young and inexperienced when I looked him in the eyes. <br /><br /> I used to work in a department store, and it was as elegant as this one. Unfortunately, it has disappeared and vanished in the dark. We were famous for those large windows that were used to attract passers-by to the store, to buy all that wonderful merchandise. <br /><br /> 10/10']
