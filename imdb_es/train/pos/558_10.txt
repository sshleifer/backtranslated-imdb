Classic drama / western action with incredible cinematography that is way ahead of its time (1954). The production is very good and it can be said that it was done with pride and love. A unique look at the pioneers of NORTHT WEST in the United States is very educational and entertaining. This movie has a very low rating because most people do not like to see the reality that many "men of the law" during this particular time and place were very crooked / corrupt like most developing countries nowadays. However, the action sequences could have been more realistic, but even so, this movie really covers most of the essential elements. Not for an audience that just wants to be pure The testerone type of westerns for this movie are more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
