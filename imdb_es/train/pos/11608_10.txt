This is a great movie. When I read other reviews, I can see that I am not the only one who shed a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction, it made the ending be sincere and memorable. In the hands of a minor actress, her last scene would have seemed trivial and corny. One would never say that this movie was made on a tight budget and limited. The cinematography is beautiful and there are several renowned actors. The script is so wonderful, I can see why everyone wanted to be in it. If you see the long and long list of credits at the end, you will see that half of Hawaii contributed to this film happening, and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and creates the atmosphere throughout the film. My only "complaint" is that I almost did not want the movie to end.
