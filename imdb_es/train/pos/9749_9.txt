['I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. Definitely I was not interested in the opera at the time, but he changed my opinion. I really enjoyed this movie and I have really enjoyed opera since then. I even bought several of your CD&#39;s. Who cares what his acting skills were, basically he just played himself, which was adorable. He was so charming, so charismatic; Honestly I just wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly. He was so direct that he did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. We will definitely miss him !!']
