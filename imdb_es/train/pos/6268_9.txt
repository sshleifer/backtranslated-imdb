Carter Wong plays a noble hero in the search for a book of healing that leads him to seek the ultimate revenge! The pace is good in this movie and there are many scenes of struggle for the film to continue. Flying guillotines look evil and the main villain has no problems using them. Although the story is not solid, the action is fun and it takes you to the end (which I felt could have had a sequel). <br /> <br /> Campy and dark, this is great ol skool kung fu !!
