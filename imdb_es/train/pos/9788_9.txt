I was in the same script conference and I saw the movie. I thought that the writer, Sue Smith, summarized very clearly what the film was about. However, the movie really did not need an explanation. I thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring. A film that deals with the ability to dare, to face fear, especially the fear transmitted by the father figures, and to overcome it and, in doing so, to embrace the possibilities of life, is a film to be treasured and savored. I enjoyed it much more than the much exaggerated 'Somersault'. I also think that Mandy62 was a bit cruel with Hugo Weaving. Like an uncle of his time, he should look so good! I agree that many Australian films have been recently tarnished, but 'Peaches' delivers what it deserves. I'm glad I saw it.
