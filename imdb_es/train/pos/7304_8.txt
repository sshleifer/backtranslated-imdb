Every once in a while, a movie announces itself as terrifying or terrifying, although generally they are not. Most modern horror films fall into this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are those movies that not only cause stress and adrenaline to pump through your veins stronger than normal. In fact, they scare you to a level that you have never experienced. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is a movie of this kind. It takes so many risks that it would shake most film producers. But almost all of them work. "Halloween" is impressive in its simplicity and terrifying in general. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) cares for some children on Halloween night, while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, begins to kill the local adolescent population, and eventually appears behind Laurie. <br /> <br /> It sounds familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher full of silly teens and blood gore. It is not a possibility. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his criticism of "Halloween:" "Due to its title, Halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter movies that populated theaters throughout the the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. However, although Halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member ... "<br /> <br /> It has a point, and for several reasons First of all, it's downright scary, while most entries in the slasher genre for teens are stupid gore festivals (you could argue that many recent ones are ironic, but most also fail). Second, there is almost no violence (very little of which is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not as terrifying, and he trusts very little about it (actually, the body count is quite low). In fact, it can be argued that this is not really a horror movie, at least not by current standards of having the most deaths that can be accumulated in a single movie, increasingly boring and more sadistic than the previous one. It is based on ideas to scare, and also skill. Third, while some of the characters can do stupid things (which sometimes seal their destiny), they do not do them because they are stupid. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they are idiots, we get scared because they are making a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why "Halloween" is what is scary is because it is so easy to believe that it is real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this movie. There is nothing supernatural, there are no ridiculously creative elements of the plot, or "inventive" murders, or whatever. Instead, all the pieces and the work of the camera (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just places the camera in its place and says action. What we have is the feeling that we are actually seeing a murder right in front of us. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are probably the hardest films to make because for something to be scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It is a successful or lost game, so if I had to tell you all the good ideas Carpenter has (which I am not), they would seem primitive (particularly because they have been repeated with less effect over and over again) over the years). <br /> <br /> Acting here is not a positive point because it does not have to be. This is a movie about terrifying ideas, not a movie about dramatic characters in conflict. The actors act as real people, not as characters in a story. Nothing more. The exception to this is who plays The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary for a person to say nothing and just kill, but it's hard to do (and even harder to keep people from asking why). But man achieves it, and the result is frightening. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter's movie. He directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it and wrote the chilling result. This is a brilliant man, and his latest movie "The Thing" supports this claim, although The Thing is not as scary as "Halloween". Unfortunately, its success has declined drastically, as it does when taking advantage of the attractiveness of earning a lot of money for less freedom when the big producers "recognize their potential". As good as this film is, it is not without its flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but it is not very scary. And not many of the scares work in the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear "The Way". Fortunately, Carpenter mainly uses this time to establish a relationship between the characters and the audience. While there is no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that it is discouraging when they die. But once the movie arrives on Halloween night, it's when Carpenter gets things going and NEVER stops until you get to the end. <br /> <br /> While "Halloween" may be defective, it's just a little bit. It's a terrifyingly terrifying movie, and a must-see for anyone who loves horror movies. However, be careful, this movie will scare you!
