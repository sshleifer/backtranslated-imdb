The Intruder (L'Intrus), a film directed by the French director Clair Denis, is the liberation of cinema. Follow your own spirit through time, space and character. There may be a plot, but what I understood from that I took from the description in the Netflix DVD sleeve. Honestly, it's probably best not to know anything about the film before seeing it, because then the viewer can put aside any expectations. The film demands that the viewer think, but also makes fun of the fact that he will not get a full understanding. <br /> <br /> The human heart is the enigma of the movie. Each image questions its role, its nature and its form. The heart is the intruder, the viewer and Louis. The character of Louis is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery required by that character. Honestly, anyone could have played the character of Louis, if he or she possessed a wandering heart, willing and comfortable. However, Subor is the one that appears here; It becomes the movie, its identity is inseparable from it. Many of the images of the film that remain in my mind revolve around their expressions, vocal but mainly physical. <br /> <br /> The Intruder is poetic in his ability to capture the stillness and fullness of movement, but more fluid than any literature in The Way he refuses to take. "Surrealist" has been a term used to describe this film, but perhaps "quasi-realist" is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the movie exists beyond the possibilities of reality; the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between the heart and the dim light. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer several times if you are attracted to the visual images; Watch the movie to see the consequences of the combination of verses and the understanding of freedom.
