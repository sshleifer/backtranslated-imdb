For those of us, the Baby Boomers who came too late to the scene to appreciate James Dean et. al., Martin Sheen showed us The Way in this great feature. <br /> <br /> The premise is quite easy: cool hood meets the sheriff of a small town and All-Hell ensues, but the nuts and bolts of this film captivate the car Nut in all of us. <br /> <br /> No, this is not Casablanca, nor is it a great literature, but it is a serious movie about the cars, the rebellion and the genius that is Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this and I appreciate it for what it is and what it will be Martin for. I loved this teen movie in the 70s, and you will too.
