This film deserves a 10 for its brilliant representation of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy. While it seemed to me that the world was morally repulsive, the film did better what the narrative should do, and that takes us through an experience that we would never otherwise experience. Tim Meadows portrays Leon Phelps so convincingly, and the story took me to the uncontained world of Leon, that I momentarily forgot that I was watching a parody of the world of playboys and felt compelled to rebel against it. Here lies the undoing of the film because its great and bold achievement in the narrative has the price of its own success. Understanding that the vast majority of viewers will respond only to the history of this film that is on the surface, and reject that story, I hesitate to be misunderstood by them and I admit that I loved it. I loved not only his fascinating insights into the deluded mind of the playboy, not only because of his amusing portrayal of the idiocy of the human sex drive, but also because of his courage to fearlessly explore what is in the shadows of heterosexuality. Besides, it's funny.
