Distortion is a movie that surprised me. A kind of multi-layered drama that focuses on a man who writes a play about the experiences of his life that are happening to him right now. To be more concise, he feels that his wife is cheating him, so he hires a private eye to spy on him. His wife has no idea that this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this play also have some of those who kneel their clothes when playing together and with, say, unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. Everything culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable happens (but not really). <br /> <br /> The director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the set of characters and editions in a way that makes you pay attention. This is a really fun movie, one that I did not mind seeing and I would recommend that people take a look.
