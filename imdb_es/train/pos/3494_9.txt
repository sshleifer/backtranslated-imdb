For what it is, "Raising Victor Vargas" is as close to perfection as a film can achieve. Whether it is a pure genius of an incipient author or just one of those lucky mixes in which everything fit (probably some of each), this small and simple first part of urban life, the first love film, throws its young characters so deep that you can almost read their minds. The film begins with a strong "street" flavor but makes its way into a Latin family affair and then focuses on a story that says a lot about the uncertainty of young people and the deeply natural desire to love another. In my experience, it has never been done so much with so little (cast of tyros, director of novices, etc.). Praised by critics, but not for everyone, "Raising Victor Vargas" is recommended for indie lovers and realists in simple stories rich in humanity. (A)
