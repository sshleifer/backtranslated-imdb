Good action and interesting plot. Having seen the original, I must say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie. Good cast ... meaningful acting ... although it would be nice to see more expansion in the action scenes instead of the background story. A fun movie to watch and it keeps you alert all the time 7/10 is a correct vote, I think!
