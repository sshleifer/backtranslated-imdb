Last night I saw the Pie-lette and the word that comes to my mind is "original". It is a word that is not used much in television, since everyone tends to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of criminal shows, comedies without grace and trash of reality. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British series "Carry On ..." or those who have not heard a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I'm not sure if his presence as a narrator adds or distracts. I'll have to tune in more, but it gives the show a "Harry Potter" vibe. Maybe that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Infame, The White Countess) has a gift. He never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone to death for a minute. Joins Chi McBride ("Boston Public", Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent. Everything is fine and fun until you meet a childhood sweetheart, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things get very complicated. He can not return it and can never touch it. Boy, that would make a relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I'll be tuned to see where this series is going with the expectation that it will continue to entertain you.
