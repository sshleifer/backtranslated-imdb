['Being from a small city in Illinois, I can instantly relate to this movie. Considering the time it was made, the townspeople look awkwardly like a lot of people I grew up with. Yes, the plot is regular. And yes, the performance will not be nominated for an Oscar in the short term. But that is not the point. The point is to suspend reality and simply have fun. And this movie has fun in abundance. From the greedy and carefree banker to the well-meaning, but silly deputy, this film was made to make fun of the genre SciFi and life in a small town. Who can not smile at the sight of the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid? and I LOVED the FarmZoid. I wish I had one when I grew up. In general, considering the technology they had available at the time, this is a nice game in childhood, when you can sit on a Saturday afternoon, with Popcorn in hand, and laugh at the weaknesses of life in a small city. This is a movie that I would see again and again, if it were not for another reason than to mock myself and my small town.']
