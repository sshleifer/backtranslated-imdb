Now this is what I'm talking about. Finally, a low budget terror outlet that uses its limitations to its advantage. WENDIGO, although occasionally defective, is a triumph of the imagination. Of course, it relies heavily on the movements of the EVIL DEAD style camera due to its mood, but it is still much better than 99% of the direct scum in video. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: a family takes vacations. in a remote cabin and are threatened by a particularly deranged hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to create suspense and add layers of disturbing uneasiness through the use of the mythical Wendigo. It is real? Is everything in the child's imagination? Is it an externalization of the emotional state of the child? <br /> <br /> Some have argued that the movie is not satisfactory because you have to decide. Do not get carried away by such insignificant nonsense. A movie that makes you think is not one to avoid. It is one to rejoice in.
