The Last Hunt is the forgotten Western Hollywood classic. The issue of genocide through the slaughter of buffaloes is present in other films, but never so wildly. The role against the kind of Robert Taylor as the buffalo possessed and the killer of India is his best performance. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, your mother left you and your friends on the matinee Saterday, usually with a western comedy. But it was wrong then and now to allow a young man to see psychodramas like The Searchers and The Last Hunt. Let the children wait a few years before exposing them to movies with repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred. <br /> <br /> Why could not Mom censor these movies? Because they presented "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the climactic scene in The Last Hunt is as horrific as the Vincent Price mutation in The Fly. <br /> <br /> The mythology of the white buffalo, which is part of the texture of this film, was later ripped off by other films. including The White Buffalo, starring Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock. The laugh here is that Bronson used to play with the Indians. <br /> <br /> Today, a large remnant bison herd resides in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. In the winter, hunger forces the animals to leave the park to Montana, where they are sometimes harvested by the Nez Perce Indians of Idaho under a treaty right of the United States that predates the Lincoln presidency. Linclon signed the law of Congress that authorized the continental railroad and began the slaughter of buffaloes.
