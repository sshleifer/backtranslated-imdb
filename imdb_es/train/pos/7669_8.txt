['Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare movies that is completely off the radar, but it&#39;s worth it. It really reminds me of the old series of the 30s and 40s. That&#39;s why I would have loved watching follow-up movies ... but judging from the rest of the Full Moon production, there simply were not enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrificial scene, there are too many for a family audience, which is unfortunate, because without them it could have been a Harry Potter-style magic party that the children had eaten. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great. I was not sure if Mrs. Nipar had not moved away from a photo on the A list of this film, it was very credible. Not seriously! Anyway, it&#39;s a pity they did not have money to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a phenomenon for the children.']
