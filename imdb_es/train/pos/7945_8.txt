I'm a fan of animal movies. If you can take a plot and put the animals as main actors, you will generally conquer me. Homeward Bound did just this. They took a plot that has been as old as time and gave it a new twist. It was a complete success. It is very much an archetypal film. You have the group obi-wan (the shadow) that is wise and logical, you have the adorable but impetuous and unreliable opportunity, and the princess princess who thinks she should be spoiled and praised. These three personalities bounce off each other very well. I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters, and they did not delay it. Most people say that it can not be good because it's too childish a movie. However, what they are forgetting is that it is supposed to be a movie for children, and this still does not take away from the real movie. This is a good movie to watch when you're bored and just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without the cartoons, an Air Bud movie with a better plot. I, undoubtedly, advise you to look at it.
