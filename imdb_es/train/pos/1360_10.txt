['This is one of the favorite movies of all time. The character of Parker Posey is entertaining, and the librarian&#39;s motive will not be lost on anyone who has worked in the world of books and batteries. <br /><br /> If you are a library student, RENT THIS. Then buy the poster and hang it on your wall. The soundtrack is highly recommended too. I have shown this movie to more friends in the library than to any other, they all fall in love with it.']
