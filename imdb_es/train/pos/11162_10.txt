['The 1933 Raoul Walsh classic, The Bowery, locates the owner and operator of a saloon, Wallace Beery, against the bitter rival, George Raft, with the adopted son of Jackie Cooper Street and the handsome Faye Wray in the roles they play between their great rivalry. It is not clear exactly what the rivalry is about, but everyone follows it in the tabloids. A lot of jokes at first, but the characters are softened as the film progresses. Apart from that, there is the exuberance of the scenes in Beery&#39;s room. The various characters, sexy chorus lines, a lot of drink, a perfect creation of a lair of iniquity not restrained by the so-called prior code restrictions, and then come the Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation. Everything creates a very vivid image of a life that has gone. I do not like comparing eras, but this movie is completely different from what one could see today. The film has a lot of heart and has long lost its innocence and is absolutely a must.']
