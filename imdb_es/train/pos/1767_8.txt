Steve Carell has made a career of portraying a bit strange heterosexual man, first in 'The Daily Show', and then in several supporting roles. At Virgin, Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that makes the most of its strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who lives a quiet and lonely life. Andy is a bit strange, but somehow he's an uncomfortable guy. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially annoy Andy for his situation. But it is clear that the three have a certain respect for the decent human being that is Andy, and decide to help him by helping him to end his virginity. And so begins the search for Andy in adulthood. Andy is the innocent par excellence, and most of the humor derives from his naivet√© to the situations in which he finds himself throughout the film. Part of the humor is crude, but most of it is intelligent comedy well done. In addition, some parts of the film seemed really moving, since Andy is developing romantic relationships and friendships, perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to represent the movie as a love story or a drama; It's a comedy rolling in your seats. However, every good comedy that I have seen contains enough heart for you to worry about the characters. A good comparison would be 'The Wedding Crashers' early this summer. Virgin has a similar mood, but is perhaps a little more vulgar in some of his jokes. I particularly loved the end of the movie, which I thought was a perfect way to end the movie. Without revealing anything, he reminded me of 'Something about Mary'. Very light and fun; It leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly what you should feel when you finish a comedy. I highly recommend it
