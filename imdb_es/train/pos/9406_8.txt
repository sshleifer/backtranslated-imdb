Other commentators have detailed the plot and the social parables and comments as well (or better) as I could, but I would like to add to my admiration for this little gem of a movie. It remains very well, in fact, more than 50 years later in each category: script, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it's really a classic. This was my first exposure to the "young" Alec Guinness, and it is obvious from the very first frames what made him so special that he eventually received a knighthood. <br /> <br /> I only qualify it with an "8" because it is essentially a rather light parable that examines human nature but does not really distort it; and because the plot takes the easiest path at the end, instead of actually resolving the conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and the industrialists who chase him throughout the city. In addition, a couple of minutes of reflection reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the script: wear is almost never the determining factor in the purchase of new clothes (especially clothing); Children grow, people change size, gain and lose weight, and go with the latest fashions all the time, and have as much time as looms that have woven fabrics. And, at a minimum, the manufacturer would make a fortune by providing indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> However, this is a great movie. If you have the opportunity to see it in a classic movie channel, you should.
