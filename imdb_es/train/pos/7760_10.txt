Director Douglas Sirk re-scores with this, the great grandfather of all dysfunctional family movies. This exuberant and trashy saga is a masterpiece that perfectly combines all the elements of Sirk's soaps and places them strategically in a movie. "Written on the Wind" very obviously influenced the 1980s television series "Dallas" and "Dynasty," since this is basically a full-length version of those nightly soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, beautifully and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, a secretary from New York City who marries oil baron Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Without the knowledge of both, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet but sexy secretary. Everyone returns to the Kyle family mansion in Texas, where we meet their white trash sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! Sparks begin to fly, from romances to cat fights, this is a camping trip. Mitch not only has to fight against the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone, since he can not have his only true love, Mitch. Finishing with everything, Kyle discovers that she is impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not like it? This film marks one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogues are absolutely hot and visual metaphors are thrown in every way: the theme of the wind is great. The cast is excellent, although Bacall is completely underutilized despite receiving the best billing behind Hudson. The loss of Oscar de Stack supposedly devastated him. He considered that this was his best performance and, apparently, he was not very happy to lose. And it turned out to be a fabulous performance like the alcoholic who whined. What an awesome movie! This film demonstrates what I've been thinking for years: Sirk is the master of classical melodrama. Where is your Oscar? <br /> <br />
