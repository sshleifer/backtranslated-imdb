Centered in the center of the city and in the skirts of Detroit, this comedy seemed like an excellent duo of comedians. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very funny man, who turns out to be a policeman from Japan on the trail of a thief of industrial secrets, who has stolen a "prototype" supercharger turbo, reluctantly goes to the United States to follow the Thief , after being ordered by your commander. Pat's character clashes with the character of 'Jay Leno', a quick conversation 'but it's about a business player like the Detroit cop. However, when they cross, the honorable "manners" of Japan meet the investigative "forms" of the Detroit police, which have no experience whatsoever. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a "rhythm" that becomes an explosive two-layer team, which solves the case, cold. After fighting a crime boss in the city for the stolen 'equipment' and closing the case, these two are despising each other to be friends and work well together. A little worse for wear and in need of a long vacation in addition to everything, they manage to reach a victorious closure. I rated this as a 9. Lewis's direction makes this comedy almost perfect. Fun for all the ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
