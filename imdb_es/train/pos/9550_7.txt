Despite the success in comedy or drama, Turkish directors are a failure in the horror thriller. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples of the horrible Turkish horror movies. <br /> <br /> But if you see "Gen" you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and dark. Also the special features are colorful and are not cheap. The soundtracks are adjusted to the movie, but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is normal. <br /> <br /> As a result, "Gen" does not add any difference to horror movies, but it does not disappoint fans of the thriller. In this sense, it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
