This film is a lyrical and romantic memory told through the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy who lives in a Cuban rural town the year of Castro's revolution. Obviously, it is a genuine work of dignified love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are simply attempts to erroneously market this as an action movie. Dreaming of Julia makes much more sense. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is simply an inconvenience for people's lives and activities. Only that fact makes the film more honest than most of the works that deal with this period of time in Cuban history. <br /> <br /> The overuse of the voice-over narrator undermines the story, but the movie makes up for it with an unqualified rating. Clips of Hollywood movies that say much more visually than the narrator could do. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with CINEMA and PARADISO are a fair game, since the film becomes melancholic about the movies, but there is an underlying pain in the loss. Of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like the movie JULIE, never seems to have an ending.
