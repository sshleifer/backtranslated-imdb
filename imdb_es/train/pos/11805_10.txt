Fragglerock is excellent in the way that Schindler's List was excellent. A great watch for children and adults of all genres. The large noses can be seen as insinuations to phallic symbols, in the same way as H.R. Puff N Stuff had hinted at the habit of smoking marijuana. Your children will love this movie. I enjoyed it a lot like a child. My father showed me this movie when I was a kid. He also enjoyed it and pointed out that exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. Although at that time I had no idea what they were. The movie is comedy and adventure. The plot is extravagant and cheerful. Me and you will enjoy this together.
