In this first episode of Friends, we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and eventually Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We discovered that Rachel, a rich girl who is Monica's friend in high school, left her boyfriend, Barry, at the altar, since she discovered that she did not love him. She also decides to live with Monica and become independent from her father, getting a new job as a waitress at Central Perk. <br /> <br /> Ross, on the other hand, discovered that his wife is a lesbian and lost her because of her. Susan, your partner. (We see him moving to a new apartment during the episode) <br /> <br /> Monica, in this episode, makes (and finally sleeps) with Paul "the wine kid", who gave her the excuse of being helpless. who divorced his wife. But really, he was just cheating on her. <br /> <br /> Ps: I love the haircuts of Joey and Chandler in this first season! =)
