If you can not enjoy a movie for girls, stop right now. However, if you like movies that illustrate complex characters and provide an extraordinary performance, read on. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord is dying. His two daughters arrive to be next to his bed. Ann begins to talk about the people of her past that the daughters are not aware of, and they wonder if these lost acquaintances are real or imaginary. They realize that these people from their mother's past are, in fact, real. <br /> <br /> The story changes, basically, between 1953 and circa 2000, with some glimmers in Ann's life between those years. It was in 1953 that Ann met the love of her life and experienced the greatest tragedy of her life. <br /> <br /> One of Ann's two best friends at the university, Lila, is getting married. Ann's other best friend is Lila's brother, Buddy. Lila and Buddy are the children of a wealthy Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret singer who lives in Greenwich Village and wants to be a free spirit, but is still subject to many of the conventions of the 1950s. <Br /> <br /> Shortly after Ann becomes the maid of honor at Lila's wedding, she meets the person who will become the central character in the lives of the three: Harris. He is the adult son of a former family servant who grew up with Lila and Buddy and became a doctor in a small town in New England. Ann immediately falls in love with Harris, which adds a complication to the fact that Lila has always been in love with Harris and still is. Buddy, too, is in love with Harris, but in 1953, he has redirected that homosexual desire for Harris to his good friend, Ann, because he can not admit that he has a sexual desire for another man. Buddy exhibits his inner frustration outwardly by being the bad boy of the family, alcoholic and cunning, to the annoyance of his very correct and correct parents. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all this expressed and repressed. Emotions lead to tragedy: after all this is a movie for girls. <br /> <br /> At the present moment, Ann's daughters have moved away from their mother and are suffering from their own experiences and doubts. Constance is working to emotional exhaustion trying to maintain her role as perfect mother and wife. Nina, who has always felt inferior, can not maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Shake all these relationships in a span of fifty years, and get an intriguing view of society, its values ​​and its effects on personalities. and the actions of the complex people involved. <br /> <br /> The whole performance at Evening is excellent, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes, along with two unique family relationships, which make this film very, very special. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays Ann in the 1950s, and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is in conflict for what she is supposed to do instead of what he wants to do. . His performance is not easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann, whose mind changes from present to past to fantasy flights and, of course, Redgrave accomplishes everything with an excellent style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - the real daughter of Redgrave - plays Ann's daughter, Constance, in the film. The scenes between this mother and daughter of real life playing a fictional mother and daughter are a perceptive pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays Ann's other daughter, Nina. Nina spends a large part of her time becoming depressed and feeling sorry for herself while excluding a good man who loves her, as well as her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for a role like this, but I've never seen her give a bad or incredible performance, no matter what role she plays. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gummer plays Lila in the 1950s and shows us an even more conflicted woman in her expected role in life than her good friend, Ann. She is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, Gummer's mother, plays the current Lila. What you have to say about Meryl Streep, apart from the fact that she always offers an insightful and rewarding interpretation. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai states in the DVD extras that he looked for Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother because she felt she was the only actress she could think of to interpret a scene in the movie. Certainly he was right, and Close's performance in that scene records it in his mind. All the other scenes in which Close is the very appropriate mother of Lila, and you get another performance to treasure. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the film, combined with the one described to Close, that make the whole movie worth seeing. On the day of Lila's wedding, Ann enters her room and gets into bed with her friend to talk about Lila's misfortunes about her upcoming wedding with a man she clearly does not love. This scene is repeated fifty years later, when Lila comes and goes to bed with her friend Ann, who is dying, to talk about the lives they have lived. In this last scene, Streep and Redgrave are fascinating. <br /> <br /> The other memorable scene, at least for me, is when Buddy declares his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy, like Buddy, gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. Its performance is superior. <br /> <br /> Chick movie? Yes. A very special film with an incredible performance, direction and stage? Insurance. I can not recommend the night too much.
