This movie was almost a great imaginative film. A mix of shakespeare, pop, jazz and fairy tales. This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme. With a strong cast, led by the perfect Kathleen Turner, this movie had everything in its favor. Everything except production values. I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with an extraordinary production like this, it came out with the same sordid quality as any other television movie. In addition to better photography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
