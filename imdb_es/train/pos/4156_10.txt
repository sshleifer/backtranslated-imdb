I've seen a lot of episodes of Cold Case since its premiere (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but this was one of the best examples of writing and acting I've seen at Bruckheimer's house.) It was especially successful for the officers Younger, and the script and the editing, the soundtrack and the acting made this episode a force tour, if I was the producer, I would send this episode to be considered Emmy. the limits of the 48-minute episode, which makes many talented people do everything possible, I hope there's an early warning of when this episode is repeated, because I'm sure I'll notice a lot that I did not realize the first time .
