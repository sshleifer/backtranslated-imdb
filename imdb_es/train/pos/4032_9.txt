Pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard. Set in Indian Partition, this film shows the true reality of the Indian partition. Urmila gets the highest rating for her beautiful and deeply emotional interpretation of a suffering woman who has no way to go. Their freedom, personal identity and family respect were stripped overnight of a tragic dispute over the land. Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as his rapacious remordedor. There are several moments in the movie where you start crying. The film in points is deeply traumatic. Some of the partition scenes are chilling, but Urmila's resistance and survival are remarkable. From a woman deprived of her freedom to a woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. A remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and stories.
