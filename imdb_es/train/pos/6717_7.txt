This documentary was very complete and revealing, and at the same time entertaining, which I found quite impressive. I felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its origin to the present day, but nevertheless, there is a reason why I do not give such a high score to this movie ... <br /> <br /> I felt as if sometimes the story focused too much on the 'names' of the sport, so to speak: too much on individual locations to navigate, and especially too much on individual surfers. I felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, the ideology of the sport, etc. it would have been better (although this, of course, was covered, I do not think I had as much time as I justified it). ). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not absolutely crazy about surfing, sometimes listening to them talk about specific places and specific surfers can get bored. Although video clips and in-depth research are highly respected, they could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid for surfers. <br /> <br /> Also, my biggest disappointment was in The times they talked about how absolutely amazing and miraculous certain events in the history of surfing, they still did not have the actual images of these events unfolding, and all the time that is waiting to see on the silver screen this incredible and impressive event that these men talk about life changing moments, and in the end, the only thing you get are many men who talk about it, and not the real images. It was too tempting for me to hear these stories, and then be unable to see them. I understand the difficulty of getting images of everything, but, please, do not brag about an event and then do not show it. <br /> <br /> In general, a very cool documentary that I enjoyed watching; It is not the best documentary due to the previous reasons, but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting images and a good soundtrack, it is a documentary that I would recommend everyone to take a look.
