Jazz fans will treasure this classic short that shows some of the best jazz men doing their thing. It's like watching a music video without luxuries today. <br /> <br /> Jazz men give us an additional gift in the person of Marie Bryant who sings a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I had never heard her sing, Bryant sounds remarkably like Billie Holliday. That is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Your instrumental work is also the best. With the black cinema of his time fed with many white stereotypes, this film must be seen and treasured. There are no great production values, just a lot of good music.
