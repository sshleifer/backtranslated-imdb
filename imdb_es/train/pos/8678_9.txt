Butch the peacemaker? Evidently. After Spike's violent start, Tom and Jerry sway, Butch stops and wants to know why. That's a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get along with dogs, can not they?" he asks Tom, who nods his head in agreement. "Mice can get along with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no" and then sees that that is not the correct answer. <br /> <br /> They enter and Butch elaborates a "Treaty of Peace" (complete with professional illustrations!). Most of the rest, and most of the caricature, are the three extremely kind to each other. What a refreshing change of pace. I thought it was fun to see him. I can a million of these cartoons in which each one surpasses in the head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you knew that peace was not going to last. A large piece of meat spells the death of the "peace treaty", but on the way it was a pleasant change and still had some of Tom and Jerry's usual intelligent humor.
