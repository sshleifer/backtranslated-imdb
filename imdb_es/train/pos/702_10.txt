['This film is one of the best short films I&#39;ve seen in my life, and as I dare to attend the main film festivals, I&#39;ve seen a lot, especially what the industry considers &quot;the best&quot;. I&#39;m not a fan of Monaghan. His acting in general tends to be exaggerated and uninteresting for me, his only decent performance is on Lost, so I usually try to avoid his films. However, by chance I saw this at a film festival a few years ago and was completely amazed. This director really knows what she is doing. Of course, you will get the trolls (or simply ignorant people) who do not understand what constitutes a good movie and get rid of the low budget work because they have no idea what happened. But fortunately, from what I have seen, they are a minority when it comes to this gem. <br /><br /> Let&#39;s not deny that the film was working without a budget, and that a couple of supporting actors could still use the work, because that is true. The production value is very low, but what can you expect from a real first movie of someone who is still in high school? Pretend for a moment that the budget does not matter. If you take away a little of the performance, the quality of the sound (which was not really the filmmaker&#39;s fault, I saw it at a festival and the sound was good ... I guarantee you whoever made the DVD in its entirety), and the fact that it was recorded in mini-DV, then what do you have left? The story, the visual composition and the soul of the film, which are indisputably perfect. <br /><br /> Nanavati can tell a story. That is clear. You can write scripts that contain a lot of substances, better than most people in Hollywood, create a list of shots that perfectly complements that story and give it life in a fascinating and creative way that, if it&#39;s a higher budget, there could be won awards. Give the most experienced actors, best sound post-production and 35mm instead of mini-DV and even the trolls could not complain. This girl is amazing, and considering that Insomniac was made a few years ago, she has done an amazing job since then. The Dreams of an Angel trailer shows it, and I can not wait to see the bigger budget things it has done. 9/10 stars, this is a great movie by a great filmmaker.']
