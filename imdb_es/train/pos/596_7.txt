This fact for the television version of the legendary stand against the desperate odds is more objective, more realistic than the previous filmed versions of the events, although the film made after this was perhaps too much in the humanization of the figures of Sam Houston, Bowie , Travis and Crockett. . <br /> <br /> The focus here is on Jim Bowie, played with a marked and cynical detachment by James Arness, who apparently is still alive at the age of 85. Then, he returned to acting after several years off the screen. to do this part. <br /> <br /> Raul Julia, born in Puerto Rico, humanizes General Santa Ana like nobody since J. Carol Naish did it in '54. However, the Mexican dictator is presented as a lustful and haughty popinjay: never before have seen more striking uniforms. He receives excellent advice from the European officials he has hired but, convinced of his own infallibility, he does not pay attention to him. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is the only actor whose age is appropriate for the character he plays: Col. William Travis. His representation is fervent. They almost fear the older men who share command with him. <br /> <br /> The only jarring note was Brian Keith as Crockett. With a rooster-skin cap and carrying Ol 'Betsy, he stumbles as if he has entered another movie. Without any conviction in the representation, the character is reduced to a few stage conventions. <br /> <br /> The script reveals some historical facts overlooked or deleted in previous versions of the film. We learned that Jim Bowie was, in the person of Santa Ana, fighting his own brother-in-law. Mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the Napoleonic Wars a generation earlier. "Santa Ana likes a bargain." Bowie explains with irony. The whole project of defending the old Spanish mission as a fort was badly advised, a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film "The Alamo."
