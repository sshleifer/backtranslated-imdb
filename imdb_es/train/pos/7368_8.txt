I think the team behind this movie did a very good job with the limitations they had. Only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and edit everything, which I think is an achievement in itself. Although this movie is not for the masses (as an innocent young teenager is killed and there is homoeroticism involved in the story), I think this movie is a heartbreaking tragedy and the more deeply you get involved in the story, the more sad you feel. even more towards Heaton because of the love he feels but does not return. <br /> <br /> this is one of my favorite British films that I enjoyed a lot and would see again. I think it's a pity that the film is not completely known.
