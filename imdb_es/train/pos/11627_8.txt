Lisa is the manager or owner of a hotel and takes a flight to Miami. She ends up sitting next to an assassin named Jackson who tells him that he has to change a family room or that his father dies. The reason she has to change rooms is because Jackson wants to exploit her. <br /> <br /> It's a great thriller because Lisa tries several ways to escape from this ploy that Jackson has created. The whole story is great and I thought they could have spent more time on the plane. There could be more on the plane, but other than that, the whole movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the ending because it stopped my heart. I did not know what was going to happen and I was surprised. For me, this movie has just taken off.
