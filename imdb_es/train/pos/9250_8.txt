Clark Gable plays a scammer who gets into the life of the lady Jean Harlow. He tries to suck her while she rejects him with her tough girl attitude. Despite their cynicism and cons, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during a sting, he runs off leaving the loyal Harlow to the women's prison where he discovers she is pregnant. The writing of Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers is excellent, since it has many well-drawn and surprising characters (among them, a Jewish socialist woman and a black woman and her father preacher played with hardly any trace of stereotypes). Gable and Harlow show their worth as actors by adding nuances and peculiarities to their characters that send them beyond the typical roles of Gable and Harlow. And the direction is much better than you would expect from Sam Wood. A beautiful shot causes Harlow to be admitted to prison, then driven to a surprisingly snow-covered courtyard as the camera follows her. This is one of the best genres of "criminals in love" and "women's prison" and has some of the best hard dialogue ever written.
