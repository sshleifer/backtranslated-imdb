['This was the first movie in which I saw Ashley Judd and the first Victor Nunez movie &#39;I ever say, and I&#39;m glad I did. His &#39;calm tone, his&#39; relaxed rhythm, his &#39;realistic representation of a young woman just beginning in life, his&#39; excellent representation of the struggles he has to go through to make his mark in life, the decisions he makes based on what Real things, people who know, there is nothing wrong with this movie. It&#39;s the closest thing to the cinematic magic I&#39;ve seen outside the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies and, given what those movies are, that means this movie deserves a high rating. The performance of Ashley Judds, the writing of Mr. Núñez and his &quot;great simple and valuable story&quot; make this a good story of coming of age and a wonderful movie.']
