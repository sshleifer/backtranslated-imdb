Display the funniest parody of the pretentious art house movies ever made. <br /> <br /> This movie exposes all the clich√©s, and then some! Terribly bad agents (Down syndrome!). Terribly heavy, important dialogue. Scenes that are supposed to impact but fall flat. Discordant edition. Pointless plot points. All wrapped in a kind of smiling miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psychology. <br /> <br /> It accomplishes exactly what it was designed for. A hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by abused teenagers, to show their parents when they are asked what they have been doing for the last two years! After "What is it?" He received his Cannes prize, it was rumored that the presenter Werner Herzog said that the film was actually a parody, part of his own films! He supposedly exploded in the information. To this day he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, see it and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years.
