This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should have the best hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire came along and it was better, but now there's a new kind of James Bond game. This time it is a third person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are outside this house. He even has all the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench as M (forgive me if I spell it wrong). This game would be your own as the best James Bond game. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10/10
