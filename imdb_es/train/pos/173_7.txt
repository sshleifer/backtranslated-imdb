Actually, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I'm digressing. This is a kind of Mr. Smith movie that goes to Washington, with some variations but with the same premise. I recorded this cable movie years ago because I was very much in love with Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is very unlikely that a cocktail waitress will get an important job in government just because it saved the life of a great shooter. It made me laugh and it made me angry at the same time. He made me laugh because some of the situations he was in were so ridiculous that I had to laugh. (Possible spoiler onwards). It made me angry to think that our government would establish an average citizen the way he did. And the speech he uttered at the end ... beautiful. Too bad not many people have guts like that in real life.
