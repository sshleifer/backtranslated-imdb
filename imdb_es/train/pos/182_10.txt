If you are not initiated in the Gundam world, this is a good place to start. If you are exhausted in Star Wars or Star Trek, here is a compelling and realistic science fiction series in which you can immerse yourself. It's not the simplistic robot story that keeps the giant world you might have expected, but rather a complex, emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the "good guys" and the "bad guys" is decidedly less than distinct. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young and naive child who lives in a neutral spatial colony. He spends his days dreaming of Mobile Suits and playing war with his friends. During the course of this series, Al befriends an "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. In the end, little Al learns some difficult lessons about the reality of war and the necessary suffering and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I loved this series of OAV, with its great wick designs, with stories and friendly characters. I recommend this series to anyone who likes SF's realistic anime, or to those who think that anime is just silly or sexy entertainment.
