One of the best Three Stooges shorts of all time. A spooky house full of evil guys and "The Goon" challenges the best men of Alert Detective Agency. Shemp is in top form in the famous scene in the dark. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in his role as Mr. Goodrich, as the target of a murder plot. Before it's over, Shemp's "small, reliable shovel" is used with great success. This 16-minute gem moves as fast as any Stooge's short and packs twice as much. Highly recommended
