This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one man industry. This movie will also tell you why Indian filmmakers are astute buyers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the peak of her Bollywood dominance when her only godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use her image once again. Prakash has a habit of choosing themes and building stories from them, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clich√©s. Zanzeer saw the realization of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal had to do with the loyalties of the master servants. <br /> <br /> But then, the theme was limited to moving the script through the regulation three hours of song, dance and drama. What is part of the film is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and becomes a regulatory hero. Amitabh's vocal abilities and diction saw that this movie earned a lot of money, thanks to his impeccable Haryanvi accent. For me, this is just the biggest attraction of the movie. The rest, everything is typical Bollywood screen writing. <br /> <br /> Amitabh, for now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of them. The fight against the shoe at the party, the monologue on Vijay Merchant and the considerations of Vijay Hazare, The challenge of mosquitoes in the boardroom and the usual drunken scene that has already become a standard Amitabh rate. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the film with his capricious and capricious character (remind him that he asked Ranjeet to say "Shaaadaaaap" after the poisoned cake incident.) His role was Most important of the teacher, while Amitabh was his loyal servant, but Prakash Mehra knew that the Indian mind ... and then Shashi had to continue with his performance with the rest of the film, it was a character that could have been more developed for Make a serious film, but this is a caper, remember? And as long as it stayed that way, people came and saw Amitabh with a new hat and went home happily, the ending is always predictable, and the good ones they stay with the girl and the bad guys go to jail, the old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and everything is fine that ends well. <br /> <br /> So w What is it that Does this movie become a classic close? Amitabh Bacchan as Haryanvi Prakash Mehra created another icon in the name of a story. Chuck the story, the characters and the plot. My marks are only for Amitabh.
