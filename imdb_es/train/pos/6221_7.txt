If this movie had been armed a little better, I would be there with the best of Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it is a good movie but too long with a complicated plot, that is, Randolph Scott, who plays the sister of Rogers, played by Harriet Hilliard (who is the wife of Ozzie Nelson for you baby boomers). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two men from the Navy. Scott meets Hilliard for the first time when she looks like a stereotyped librarian, and later, after Ginger Rogers asked her friend (a blonde but unmistakable Lucille Ball) to give her a touch of glamor. Meanwhile, Astaire tries to continue where he and his former dance partner left him. The result is some wonderful dance numbers, with Astaire and Rogers as a team, as well as separately: "I put all my eggs in one basket", "Let Yourself Go" and "I prefer to direct the band". Hilliard is sweet but a bit lethargic as a simple Jane became a glamorous girl, although she sings well her two songs, "But where are you?" and "Get Thee Behind Me, Satan": a poster did not like that song, but I love the title. Rogers is vivacious, and a juvenile Astaire is a dynamo. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film comes to an end with "Let's Face the Music and Dance", one of the most beautiful and painful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliant performed by Rogers and Astaire. In it, they personify the glamor and fantasy of the 30s. It really is to be treasured and observed over and over again.
