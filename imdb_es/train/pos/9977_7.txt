SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /> <br /> I'm really in the minority in this case, but I liked this movie. It's not a classic, but it's definitely a trip full of adrenaline. I definitely thought it was worth at least a rating of 7. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the reason I liked it is because I have not seen the original. Something tells me that with a movie like this, the strongest fans will be People who have not seen the original version and, therefore, have little to compare. This was not a masterpiece, but I really liked it and it really made me want to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were some things that I liked. One was Kowalkski's casting. Viggo Mortenson was excellent and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. Since most of the movie fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be excellent and he was. This was a great role for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it is made for television. I had no idea that this was the case when I looked at it. Of course, it looked like a great movie and I never would have guessed that it was not a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found that the story is very absorbing. I'm not one of the action movies, but I let myself get caught up in this. Also, it was much more than an action movie in which there was drama, mysticism, a love story, extravagant people in every way. (I did not even recognize Priestly.) And it was touching. This was not a great movie but you can see it. <br /> <br /> And then there is the end. It presents a strong blow and if one has been involved in the story until then, it is very difficult not to be paralyzed in the end. I'm not sure how I feel with the ending. The implication was that Kowalkski survived and although I am very skeptical of HOW that would be possible, it is a movie and realism is not an ingredient that is always in the mix when a movie is made. <br /> <br /> So I must say that I found the ending incredibly unrealistic but very moving in a manipulative way, which I often do not like, but for some reason, it is almost forgivable in this film. Admittedly, many things were only accessories for the plot (could the villains have been more stereotyped?) But the creators were very successful, even if they were wrong in many things. However, having said that, I must admit that I can understand why someone who is a big fan of the original would hate this version because, although I have not seen the original, I have seen many original films that I loved with my terrible results. (My great dislike is actually the sequels). But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of such high quality. <br /> <br /> People have compared this with Smoky and the Bandit. How about a roadside version of "Legends Of The Fall" and "Thelma and Louese" too? I certainly felt the touches of both movies (of which I am a fan). However, I do not think it was a great movie. It was better than the average for me, but far from being great. But it was an absorbing film, full of adrenaline and moving, with excellent cast of the main character. My vote is 7 out of 10.
