I argue that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this movie has been completely wrong. NOBODY I know I wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and ALL who actually saw it (to my knowledge) adored it ... The advertising campaign is misfortune / disaster / error. <br /> <br /> Open at # 4 behind ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush hour, which I have not seen, the average IMDb score of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourn Ultimatum, I've seen, awesome movie but third week, average score in IMDb of 8.7 (it would be worth saying). <br /> <br /> # 3-The Simpsons Movie, which I have seen, good movie but 4th week, average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower than Bourn, but that has been ours for 3 weeks). <br /> <br /> Whether it's bad programming or bad publicity, I think the powers behind this movie were wrong in a big way. This should have been advertised as an amazing movie that turns out to be a fantasy / fairytale and not be publicized as another fairy tale. Too bad :( Anyway, now that I've walked senselessly, unceasingly, in ... Incredible movie, go see it!
