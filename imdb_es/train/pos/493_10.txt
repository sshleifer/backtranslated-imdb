['I&#39;ve been a Star Trek fan since I can remember. When they announced the planning and release of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /><br /> The premiere of Enterprise was worth the wait. It was well done with the perfect scenery and a great acting work done by all the characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love. <br /><br /> Scott Bakula was superior to Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave an imposing performance as Subcomandante T&#39;Pol. That&#39;s just two people from this wonderful new team that will take us to the great history of Starfleet. <br /><br /> Enterprise seems like it&#39;s going to be a good series that&#39;s worth seeing, and I recommend it. Look at it.']
