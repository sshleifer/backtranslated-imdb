The best games of Kasparov or Fischer can be a disaster for a total novice. It's a good movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is the track! This is a private plot, built as a private company. This is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. In conclusion, the scenario describes the perfect professional plot: private, self-organized, self-destructive, without a trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: an intelligent "director" with some money. Everything can be done only by delegation. The "director" must be only a trigger. If the normal viewer can not see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the film, a real plot has less chance of being discovered. All the actors' performances are well done, with a special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
