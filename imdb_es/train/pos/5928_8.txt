This is not a good movie but I still like it. The Clovis cat is gold in a jar, as is the premise of the cats themselves, intrinsically opposed to the evil sleepwalkers. I think there is more to this film than people think, basically it is very hard, but this abruptness can sometimes be good. It has the corny lines, the abrupt ending and a comic element transmitted by the clumsy policemen. <br /> <br /> Did someone find the incestuous element a little unsettling? Ultimately, this film is casually and randomly marital, which is quite effective, I compare it with Psycho: the relationship between mother and child, the change of protagonists. I think brusqueness also works, this is not a movie that you want to lengthen, it only works if it's short. <br /> <br /> I'm still not sure if the director lacked depth or if he did. These things with purpose, we know that Stephen King has ability, but I have not even read his books, I've only seen some of his movies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you like cursed movies with nuances of the 80s, just look at it. But do not expect too much. It really is so bad that it is good.
