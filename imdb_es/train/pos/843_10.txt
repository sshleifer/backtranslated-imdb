Not easily mentioning the best performance of Pierce Brosnon. Of course Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when has it been really bad? I think this movie is incredibly underestimated! The use of colors in this film is something very different in the current cinematographic world, where all the other films have the blue filter of return of payments. I also love the way they used the Asian song. Proving that even what was once thought to be a bit corny can be really cool if it is placed correctly. <br /> <br /> I was doing my first show when it came out. Being that my movie was a successful movie, I had to review anything of the genre that premiered. After seeing it, I'm sure it had some effect on me during the process. It was very good when my movie appeared on the IMDb that I would recommend this movie if you liked mine. I have no idea how any of the others are related, which makes an even more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
