I went to see Hamlet because he was between jobs. I thought 4 hours would be great, I've been a fan of Branagh; Dead Again, Henry V. I was completely overwhelmed by the direction, the acting, the cinematography that captured this movie. Like other comments, the 4 hours pass quickly. Branagh does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. When I watch this movie, I constantly try to find faults, I have looked at the fools and I have not noticed them. How he could move the camera in and out of the Hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This movie was filmed in 70 thousand. It's a shame that Columbia has not released a widescreen version of this on VHS. I have a DVD player, and I would take it on Titanic any day. So, Columbia, if you're listening, put this movie the way it should look! And I do not know what happened at the Oscars. This should have swept Better Film, Better Actor, Better Direction, better cinematography. What movies were you watching? I felt sorry for Branagh at the Oscars when he made a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They should have paid tribute to Branagh for bringing us one of the best movies of all time.
