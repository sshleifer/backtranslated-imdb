SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC.2 The French filmmakers who are in New York to film the actions of a NYFD face this event and make the most of it. Before 9/11 it does not really happen that much, which gives the film an even more horrific scenario. The day of the attacks seems to be another boring day at work, but this will change soon. When the filmmakers hit the road with the firefighters filming the first plane to crash, this is the only recording of the first impact. Travel with the firefighters to the WTC and enter the building. When the second plane crashes, people understand that this is not an accident. In the next period of time we see the firemen making plans to save as many people as possible, in the meantime we hear sounds of blows, these are the sounds of people who jumped from the tower and fell to the ground, this is the most exhausting moment in the documentary. Then, the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his life. Listen to him breathing like crazy while running out of the building. Then a huge sandstorm hits him and the screen turns black, he was lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown New York. Because this documentary has many historical images and because the film was something totally different, this documentary will probably stay in everyone's memory. I saw the attacks live at home because I had the afternoon of, so this makes it even more realistic. watch. 10/10
