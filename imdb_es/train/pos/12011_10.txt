['I am surprised by the negative comments I have read and can only assume that the people who made such comments were less than honest. This is the most moving and real portrait of Joseph Smith I have ever seen. He acted well to the point that sometimes he forgot he was watching a movie. He brought Joseph&#39;s life of difficulties, kind optimism, enduring faith in people and in God, and the ultimate sacrifice to life in such a way that, frankly, left me speechless and silent with amazement. If someone, from ANY Christian religion can see this movie without being touched in any positive way, I would have to say that it is a reflection of the person and NOT of the film. I give the movie a &quot;10&quot; and I encourage honest souls to see it. At the very least, it&#39;s a very sentimental portrait of the man who gave everything he had for what he believed ... In a world where values and beliefs are ridiculed, this film is a lasting reminder of the kind of people who are supposed to we are to be, no matter what religious beliefs we have.- Ann Pruitt-']
