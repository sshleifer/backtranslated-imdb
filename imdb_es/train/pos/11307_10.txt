To get in touch with the beauty of this movie, pay close attention to the soundtrack, not only to the music, but to the way in which all the sounds help to weave the images. How beautifully the opening scene that leads to the expulsion of Gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity! Observe the way the music presents the characters as we move into Giovanna's marriage. Do not expect to find much of Italy's political life in 1943. It's not about that. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will be guided to a word that goes beyond neorealism. At the end of the film, there are moments like the Antonioni landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
