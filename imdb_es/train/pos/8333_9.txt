['IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that confronts the greatest scientific minds and deepest thinking of the twentieth century as Cupid&#39;s helpers. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this happy but thoughtful film. You do not really know how to react because part of the time you see big scientists doing nonsense to feed the budding love, but on other occasions, you listen to discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space / time of our era. The end result is a funny movie with surprises. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates a peculiar mathematical and clueless brain, and Tim Robbins gives life to the contradictions of an uneducated working man who is fascinated by science. All together, they create an absurd journey through love and science, mind and heart.']
