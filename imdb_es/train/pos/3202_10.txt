I can not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why do you think it's so bad, etc. It is not worse than anything else. Personally I think "Soldier" is a great movie, much better than most other films of the same genre. <br /> <br /> Reasons why I liked "Soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the screenplay (David Webb Peoples), excellent visuals and direction (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I even think this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who previously directed the entertainment. "Mortal Kombat" and the not-so-entertaining "Event Horizon".
