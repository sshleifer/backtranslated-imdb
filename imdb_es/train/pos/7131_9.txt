This film made for television is brilliant. This is probably the best and preferred role of BAFTA winner John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). The widowed man of Tom Oakley (Thaw) has lived alone in a village since his wife and son died, and has now been landed with an evacuated named Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). As you meet this child, begin to develop a friendship. Until Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants him back. After Tom worries that William does not contact him, he goes to London to look for him. In the end, Willaim gets home with a loving family (or dad). Set during the Second World War, this is an excellent movie. He was nominated for the Lew Grade BAFTA Award, and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Drama. John Thaw was number 3 in the 50 biggest stars of television. Very well!
