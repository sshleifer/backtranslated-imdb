Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network, or at least have the opportunity to have its entire series of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Given that American audiences (apparently) have the ability to care for a mosquito when it comes to humor that does not consist of rants with profanity, or has a concern for eschatological functions (sound and smells), programs like this will be few and far between. each. One of the main problems was that, however brilliant it was, it was made for a rarefied audience that knew what to expect, but was seen by an audience and boardrooms that had no idea what they were seeing. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this program, even if it was produced for a direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were full of subcontext and there were other conversations waiting below the surface. But thanks to political correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
