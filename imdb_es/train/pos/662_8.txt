A second delivery of axellent that manages to be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, the casting is simply wonderful. I like that the first and second episode have nothing in common, except wit and intelligence. <br /> <br /> The second episode is very funny, very silly and very nice. It is the first episode of Christmas, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer disguised as Santa Claus after killing her own husband. Like the first episode; karma. <br /> <br /> The most humorous scene is a link between her husband's murder and her phone call, simulating her fear until it becomes real.
