Interesting, fast-paced and fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those people who watch a lot of television. I came across this program while I was sick at home with a severe case of flu one day and I was hooked immediately. I developed quite in love with John Burke. Both he and Claire did an incredible job of organizing the show together. You could really say that both loved their jobs. <br /> <br /> The super collector segments were excellent. I found myself interested in things I had never given a single thought before. <br /> <br /> What I would really like to know is: What happened to Jack the dog? Did one of the hosts adopt it?
