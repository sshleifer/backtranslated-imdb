I loved "Dan in real life". A wonderful story of the journey to love as you have a mail or While you were sleeping, but not ridiculously full of jokes and jokes, and not so romantic that you feel like throwing up. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advice columnist who seems unable to fix things in his own life. Until one day, in a reunion / family trip, he finds himself and instantly connects with Marie (the always beautiful Juliette Binoche), a radiant copy of a woman who seems to be framed in a nebulous filter reminiscent of the stars of classic cinema . The chemistry happens with a cup of tea and biscuits, but Marie must be out by a previous commitment, and they must separate. <br /> <br /> We are later treated by Dan's relatives, fun-loving relatives who not only have great breakfasts together but also enjoy using the smart and sweet Dork as the butt of many singles jokes. What I liked so much was that, although the characteristics of the family could be considered unpleasant for some, I thought it was a great portrait of a great family that did not venture into parody or gross exaggeration. The Burns family is simply a close and loving group of people who are really interested in what's best for Dan. There are wonderfully uncomfortable family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is nosy, but never petty or gossipy; peculiar, but never extravagant. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend that he brought to the family reunion. And so begins a rollercoaster of longing and amused love budding of love. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I thought that this movie was just amazing. He is not particularly "modern" or "intelligent", he is never too tedious and is obsessed with dry humor or biting wit like many comedies in modern cinema. There is a good balance of visual images and funny but real dialogues. In fact, at the beginning of the film, the initial spark of love begins with a capricious discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation, in which the characters say what they are thinking out loud. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I have probably rambled and repeated, but I highly recommend "Dan in real life". It's a great movie for a date, trust me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a geek like me, you'll have teary eyes. Filled with fun and magical love, "Dan in real life" will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 of 4 stars Grade A
