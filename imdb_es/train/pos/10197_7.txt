Well, it's been a long year and I'm about to review the final film for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of the River) is in second place at the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it did not work as well at the box office, as it was too artistic for ordinary viewers, especially because the MMFF is the season in which many families go out to watch movies. <br /> <br /> It was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English on the screen. I thought that CÃ©sar Montano did a good job as a star and as a director. His great vision and creativity really helped this movie. He was also very effective as the main star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that were required for the film. The young actress Rebecca Lusterio also acted well. She did a great job portraying Bikay, Duroy's younger sister. I hope to see her in many more film projects in the future, maybe venturing into other genres. I think the fact that this movie was in her local dialect really helped her. <br /> <br /> Some of the camera shots in the movie were done very well. The stage became impressive, although I think if a minor effort would have seemed completely different. <br /> <br /> In terms of the story, I feel that the writers could have delved deeper into the lives of the minor characters in the movie. I certainly will not be excited about the story of this movie.
