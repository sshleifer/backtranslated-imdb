This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comic genius. The rest of the cast is amazing, and the movie is really fun. A definitive satire of horror films, with a crazy twist. If you enjoy a fun night full of comedy, then go and rent this classic. You will laugh all the way!
