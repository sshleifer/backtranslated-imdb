Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how a world leader (like Ch√°vez) who supports poor people in his country can be considered so low in the United States. Your worst "sin", in my opinion, is to worry about those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about that? I have always been fascinated by the reaction of the media in the US government. UU To Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he supplanted Batista. Soon, however, Castro began to turn the corporations in Cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and our government have so many problems to share with the poor? If these guys are "dictators," then we could use more "dictatorships," especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
