About a year and a half ago, my father told me about The French Doors. I thought it sounded pretty interesting but I did not try to find it anywhere. Then, about a year ago I remembered that movie and I thought "hey why not" and I tried to find it on the Internet. Finally, after about a week of searching, I found it in atomic movies. I called my dad at the computer and said, "Hi Dad, I've found that creepy movie you told me centuries ago!" He smiled at me, turned around and turned off the lights so that it was completely dark, apart from the computer screen, and told me to see it. I started well ... Then, when he began to worry about what was there, I found it very disconcerting. In the end, I pushed my chair back and stood up ... it made me jump !: P: if you have not seen this movie, I recommend you do it because it's worth it. Even after the fourth or fifth time, it remains disturbing. <br /> <br /> GREAT MOVIE!
