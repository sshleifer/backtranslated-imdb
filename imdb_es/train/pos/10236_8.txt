Hi, Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The main protagonist of the films is undoubtedly the bastard son of these two strange parents. As for the other characters, they are family transformations of stereotypes of similar action films. Where this film is original is the mix of traditional Hong Kong movie style with the Hollywood action adventure. Unfortunately this has not been the case in the movies he has made in Hollywood.
