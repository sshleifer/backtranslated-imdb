['This was the first regular episode of the movie Columbo, but it was aired as the second, after &quot;Columbo: Murder by the Book&quot; by Steven Spielberg. It is also at the same time among one of the best! <br /><br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was a great creative director! No wonder he was later asked to direct three other Columbo films. The film has some really creative and innovative shooting sequences and the film as a whole is also clearly done with style, passion and attention to detail. Each jack connects and is one reason why this movie is better and also looks better than any other average made for television movies. It is definitely one of Columbo&#39;s best-directed films. <br /><br /> It&#39;s an original Columbo entry for a couple of reasons. Murder is more or less an accident and it was an impulsive act. So the killer this time does not have time to plan the &#39;perfect murder&#39; in advance and his to clean up any trace later and has to get rid of the body. The killer in this movie is not only being handled like the man who committed the crime, but rather like the man who helps Lieutenant Columbo solve the murder. It also makes the character more interesting and layered, and also helps make Columbo solve all the crime and look more interesting because of that. Of course, Columbo begins to suspect him from the beginning and, as always, resolves, becomes vulnerable and looks more stupid than he really is and gains the assassin&#39;s confidence. Obviously, this is not a spoiler, since this is the way each Columbo movie is set up. I liked the story of the film and how it progressed. <br /><br /> It also helps the movie that has such a fine cast. At the time of this film, Peter Falk had really taken over the character of Columbo and the character was already fully developed. Robert Culp is really great as the bad-tempered Brimmer. The funny thing is that later he would star in three different Columbo movies again and an episode of &quot;Mrs. Columbo&quot;, only in totally different roles. He even played the killer again in a couple of those movies. By the way, he was not the only actor who did this in later Columbo films. Also the great Ray Milland makes an appearance in this film, as the victim&#39;s husband. <br /><br /> In short, a great film by Columbo and one of the best in the long series of films. <br /><br /> 9/10']
