The tremendous black and white nocturnal cinematography, and in abundance, highlights this story of a supposedly true life of a murder in the 1950s in Kansas in which two men eliminated the entire family. <br /> <br /> The story It was written by Truman Capote, so a very liberal message appears against the death penalty at the end of the film, which is ridiculous to know the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who have a twisted vision of life and unnecessarily kill this nice family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying lean at the end, this is a fascinating story from the start and the cinematography makes this all the more fascinating. The famous photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job in this. It makes me wish that the most modern films were made in black and white. Watch it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the entire cast are excellent here. The third time I saw this movie came in early April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was declared innocent in his wife's murder trial. One can not help looking at Blake and this movie differently after that.
