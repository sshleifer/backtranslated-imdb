How can someone not love this movie? I think it's a hilarious parody of all the old gangster movies; If you've never seen them, look at this instead. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role and anything goes. A boy handles the English language every time he speaks and Griffin Dunn plays a carefree D.A., but my favorite role is Joe Piscopo. He has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston are in this movie full of stars that corners the gangsters much funnier than "Mafia" did for the underground criminal.
