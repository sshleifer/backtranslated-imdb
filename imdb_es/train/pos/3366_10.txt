Ettore Scola, one of the most refined and great directors that we have the citizens of the world, is not yet available on DVD ... (it is summer of 2001 at this moment ...) Mysteries to amaze the mind. <br /> <br /> This great classic returned to the theaters of my hometown thanks to Sophia Loren, a summer retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of watching it in a video. ribbon ... it's a real gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid a criticism, but nonetheless, try to prove a point: I took my reluctant younger brother to see this movie. He had never seen the film before and "he does not like those Italian Oldies ..." Like everyone else in the theater, this wonder intrigued him. Even during the final titles, the theater remained completely silent. <br /> <br /> This SPECIAL DAY is really special. A wonder of refinement. And a great loss if you have not seen it yet ...
