I used to watch this show as a child. Although I do not remember much about it, I must say that it was a very good show. Also, I do not think I've seen all the episodes. However, if you ask me, it's still a good show. I vaguely remember the musical theme. All were cast ideally, the design of the wardrobe was great. The performances were first class, too. I just hope that some network will bring this series some day to see each episode. Before finishing this, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory forever, although I do not think I have seen all the episodes. Now, in conclusion, when and if this program is again broadcast on air, I hope you catch it a day before it leaves the air forever.
