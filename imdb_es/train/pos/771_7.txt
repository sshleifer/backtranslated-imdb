I watched the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her friend. So I had views of all kinds of directions. Mainly, the movie made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only notable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think he played his part well, even if the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just did not have complex roles. I applaud that Puya is entering the movie business. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, but I hope he's a good actor. <br /> <br /> The wife loved the movie, and I think there could be chords being played and for which I had no ear. If the film tried to present unusual sexual behaviors and its consequences in present-day Romania, then it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Imagine that girls are really a boy and a girl, and the story itself becomes a boring and uninteresting storyline. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why he got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, I should have won the "Best luck next time" award. (bafta = good luck in Romanian).
