John Thaw, of the famous inspector Morse, plays old Tom Oakley in this movie. Tom lives in a small English village during 1939 and the start of World War II. A little secluded, Tom still has not recovered from the death of his wife and son while serving during the First World War. If you can imagine old and retired inspector Morse twice as crochet as when he was a cop, then you have the character of Tom Oakley. <br /> <br /> However, this heart of flint is about to melt. The children of London are evacuated before the bombing. Young William (Willie) Beech announces himself with Tom as a protest. Willie is played with good results by Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs attention with a capital C. Behind the school, the bed is still wetting and you can not read are the smallest problems. It comes from a horrible past in London, with a mother who can not cope, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Slowly, but steadily, the man and the boy warm up to each other. Tom discovers again his capacity to love and care. And the child learns to accept this love and affection. See Tom and Willie building an anti-aircraft shelter at the end of their garden. See Willie's joy in what is probably his first birthday party organized by Tom. <br /> <br /> Not to give away the ending, but Willie is adopted by Tom after much struggle, and the couple starts a new life much richer for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this film, Thaw and Robinson follow a long list of films where the man meets the child and develops a mutual love. See the deceased Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in "Spanish Gardener". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "Started in Naples". O Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in "Captains Courageous". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man Without a Face". <br /> <br /> Two points of interest. This is Thaw's only appearance that I know where he sings. Only one verse of a hymn, New Jerusalem, but he sings. <br /> <br /> Second, young Robinson also starred in a second movie with "Tom" in the title, "Tom's Midnight Garden," which is based on a classic children's novel.
