The anime that hooked me to the anime ... <br /> <br /> Set in 2010 (hey, that's not too far now!) Earth is now a contaminated and violent toxic gas field. Seeing how the crimes are committed, the thieves have the firepower of the terrorists of the third world, the government of the fictional Port City of the Tank Police to face the problem: the police with tanks! Oh, the madness! <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki, a Japanese woman with red hair (yes, I know, they never match their clearly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance) that has just of being recruited in the Tank Police and quickly associates with Al, a nice blond guy with blue eyes. Leona is new to the use of tanks and, unfortunately, destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain (also known as "Brenten"), a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and who carries a pair of ingenious sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad temper. Britain did not like Leona joining the Tank Police in the first place and that she destroyed her Tiger Special (a giant tank of green monsters) does not exactly attract him, nor does she like her to take the remains of your giant tank. and using it to build a mini-tank that she calls Bonaparte and he is soon pushing for it to be transferred to the children's well-being "where children are more than their size", as he says. There are also Specs, the bifocal genius, the quote from the Bible / the God-fearing chaplain, the mohican purple from MO, and the pot-bellied boss, who is right on the edge thanks to the mayor who always shouts at him about police antics of tanks. Seeing that tank cops often destroy half of the city while chasing bad guys and using extreme violence to capture them, people do not love them very much. <br /> <br /> The "villains" are a cyborg named Buaku, who has a mysterious past that is related to a project known as "Green Peace", his band and his two attractive cyborg kittens, Anna and Uni Puma. In the first installment, these guys are paid for stealing urine samples from a hospital that cares for people who have not been infected by poisonous gas clouds and in the 2nd they are hired to steal a painting that is from a Buaku naked. The story, however, was not completed in the anime and ended in a cult comic book ("Manga") that is very hard to find. <br /> <br /> All this kind of chaos and chaos occur in this black comic book adventure. that examines how far people want their police to go to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good and bad begins to blur. This is the kind of thing that if you were to make a movie about that, you'd better go for Quentin Tarantino. Uneven in places but still very fun. <br /> <br /> Followed by "New Dominion: Tank Police".
