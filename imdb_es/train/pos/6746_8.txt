This is a great example of a fairly simple story by Film Noir that is handled exceptionally well, thanks to the excellent direction of Otto Preminger, as well as some performances by charming actors. Dana Andrews plays a hot-headed detective who too often uses her fists instead of her brains. Shortly after the movie begins, Andrews is being reprimanded for this and warned that if this continues, he will be out of commission. A little later, while investigating a crime, he is attacked by a suspect and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does NOT use excessive force, but the assailant dies. Andrews panics and assumes that they will not believe him, so he tries to cover up the death, although in his place the crime is blamed for an innocent man. <br /> <br /> There's a lot more to the movie than this ... -including a plot involving a sleazy villain (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). In short, this is one of the best examples of the genre: with great dialogue, excellent lighting and a simple but very effective story. This is how Noir should be.
