It has been said that Deanna Durbin invented adolescence. This first movie was one of the best. The humorous story featured a lovely 14-year-old Deanna, a bit of beauty with a beautiful voice, like the "Miss Fixit" in a family divided by divorce. For a summary of the plot, see other IMDb entries, but quickly Deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to the United States from Switzerland to prevent their father from remarrying. With an excellent cast of support, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good direction and editing, the film manages to captivate even the later viewers. Of the three songs by Deanna, only "Il Bacio" is of the classical repertoire, but when he sings it on the scene of the police station, the place of the film is insured. At least it was for this viewer that at the age of 15 he fell in love with both Deanna and classical music. One of the many nice touches that occur throughout THREE SMART GIRLS is the brief glimpse of the drunk who stretches his neck to see Deanna for the last time while the police chase him. An unfortunate result of the success of this film was that the later writers of Durbin's vehicles were trapped in the theme "Miss Fixit", which quickly became obsolete. Deanna never did it. Her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that, like many other movie personalities, she replaced "naturalness" with the histrionic skill she lacked. The stratagem worked well for 21 feature films.
