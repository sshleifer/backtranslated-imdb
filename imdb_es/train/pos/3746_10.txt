I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite parts are The French Song and the opening title when the spatula soldier shouts "BLADES!" I laugh every time. I would recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans, and to people who enjoy the other Jason Steele movies. His style of animation is very original. Some views are needed to note the detailed funds. His humor is also funny, and it's definitely not something I've heard before. Like Max, the deformed spatula that has a sound system and lighting in his head that emits colorful lights and happy music every time he talks about his miserable life. This is a wonderful animation to watch anytime anywhere.
