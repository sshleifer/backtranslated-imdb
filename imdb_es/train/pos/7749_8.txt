This movie takes your breath away. This debut film by Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band dEUS) presents 8 intriguing people, who form blocks from a compelling film mosaic. Each of them survives a day and a night in the metropolis of Antwerp. Barman paints his characters with great enthusiasm and competently intertwines their individual stories, a journey through strength that recalls the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The mosaic of anecdotes surprises, moves, entertains; The dialogues are so natural that they seem improvised. Some great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the extremely funny duo from Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is the memorable "Windman", a strange guy who dances throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the impressive choreography and, of course, Tom Barman himself took charge of the ultra cool Sound Track. We were very impressed: Any Way The Wind Blows is a movie that surprises you.
