The man who directed "The Third Man" also directed the sequence "Who will buy" in "Oliver!" Now that is talent. <br /> <br /> I raise my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know there are 'second units' involved, but still ... <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> <br /> I guess the quality will come out. <br /> <br /> (It shows in the final scene with Nancy [avoiding spoilers - everyone has to see Oliver for the first time at some point].) How many lines do I need to write? <br /> <br /> Encouraging people to write too much should not be encouraged. <br /> <br /> I hope this counts as the "tenth line".
