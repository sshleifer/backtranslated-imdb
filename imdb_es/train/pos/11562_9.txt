I just can not forget how brilliant the couple of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's like the movie does not even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialogue between these two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon had already been in several well-known films like Mr. Roberts, The Apartment and Matthau recovered from his Oscar win over The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder movie also with Lemmon). That particular movie was not as good as this because the story could not stand such a long execution time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this happens in an energetic hour and a half, although the introduction of the events that led Lemmon to end up in Matthau's apartment is a bit long (like this sentence). However, that is a minor issue and, for the rest of the time, we had a great time. <br /> <br /> I already wrote a comment about how tracking this movie was horrible and I will not go into it. in that. The reason why this is so happy is probably that the film was made just when the innocence of American films began to quickly disappear into oblivion. There are some sexual references, but they are treated in such an innocent way that you can not even get a "Well, never ..." from the most prudent person that exists. It's quite fun to watch a movie from a lost era and that's probably why the sequel did not work because you made Matthau and Lemmon say a few words and that does not fit into them. <Br /> <br /> Of course, now both are gone and you can be happy that you can still enjoy them in a wonderful movie like this one. I think the only male actor in this movie that is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So there you have it. Simply one of the best comedies and movies in history. <br /> <br /> Add: I just recently learned that John Fiedler is dead, so all the fans of him are deeply sorry. I did not want to disrespect him and I'll try to be more careful with what I'm blah blah blah next time.
