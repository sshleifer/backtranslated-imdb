['Tony Hawk Underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its shine, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really on the air about what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series that would . be different and interesting <br /><br /> Underground presented the storymode, which was very good because it created a whole new world for fans of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Another characteristic presented to the fans that more or less discussed and that was to be able to get off the skateboard, which is good because now you can climb, run and do all kinds of new things. <br /><br /> The levels are good, Neversoft also improved on a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the duration of the level designs. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some features hidden in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened due to a handful of features that were added and that really pushed the systems too to their limits. In this version, they shortened those functions, there are not so many people who are wondering about the streets, in fact, there are almost none on some levels, and the graphics and physics of skating are somewhat attenuated, but not much. <br /><br /> This game has a scam, the story mode is a bit short, of course, this is the first time that Neversofts does this with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it&#39;s understandable. However, having said that, you will definitely finish this game within a day. <br /><br /> Overall, a great addition that was very refreshing.']
