['To all the miserable people who have done everything, from complaining about the dialogue, the budget, this and that ... who wants to hear it? If you missed the point of this beautiful movie, that is your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a boy of millennia who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this is in his own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely objective explanation of what happened that night. It&#39;s the most incredible love story ever attempted. I know he&#39;s the cynic of the 90s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone in this comment panel complained that he was making too much money! How bad is that? He made money packs in all the civilized countries of the planet and it is the highest grossing film on the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time. Okay, cynics, it&#39;s time to crawl back under your rock, I&#39;m done.']
