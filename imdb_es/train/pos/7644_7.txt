Jim Belushi is fantastic as the "average Joe" who gets his 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is the mysterious bar tender that not only listens to the "story" of Belushi, but has a "cure" for all of Belushi's middle class problems: a magic potion to provoke an avalanche of changes in Belushi's life . <br /> <The flashbacks show a 15-year-old man terribly ashamed of having defeated the high school baseball team Championship. Belushi continues with his "pitiful life", apparently happy, but always wondering "what would happen if ...". What seems to be several days, Belushi experiences a "different" life, one of enormous success, admired and hated by others in equal measure. <br /> <br /> This is not quite "It's a wonderful life", but some elements are similar and very attractive. The "end" is predictable, but still satisfactory. Watch for a very young Cortney Cox, in a small part, as a "fatal attraction", as another woman. A very nice movie!
