After '' Empire Strikes Back '' '' Return of the Jedi '' is my second favorite movie in the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is making a secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous Star of Death. If this station remains fully built, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient due to the delay of the new Death Star, and they need to kill many of their commanders for the project to be carried out in a programmed manner. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are inside Jabba's palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba, where Lukes intends to negotiate Han's life. Give R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiation, since he uses Han Solo as part of the decoration of his palace. (Han is still frozen in carbonite) Lando is hidden as the guard of Jabba and Chewbacca is also delivered to Jabba by a bounty hunter. When the same Hunter tries to save Han alone and makes him stay in human form again, we see that it is actually Princess Leia in disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and takes her as his slave, while Han is thrown into Chewbacca's cell. <br /> <br /> Luke comes as a Jedi Knight to rescue his friends. In his first attempt to kill Jabba, he falls into the monstrous cell of Jabba (Bantha), but he kills her easily. Jabba gets angry and decides to throw Han, Chewbacca and Luke to Sarlacc, a great desert creature that stays 1,000 years digesting his "food". Luke, Han and Chewie are successful again, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws it into Sarlacc's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and chases Han, Luke and Chewie, as well as C3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everyone is safe again, Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi, as well as his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, since he is 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda tells Luke that he does not need any more training, but to really be a Jedi, he must fight with Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's father, and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks Luke to remember his advice about the temptation of the dark side, and Luke transmits his Jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies, the spirit of Obi wan appears to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more of a machine than a man since he became a sith Luke is still worried about killing his own father and says he feels his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and explains the reasons why Luke and Leia split up since they were babies. He gives Luke his final advice and tells him that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Emperor tells Vader that he must deliver Luke when he appears, since Luke is stronger than before, and both need to combine their efforts to take Luke to the dark side. <br /> <br /> Now we're going to have one of the best battles of the star war series. , when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, the "Death Star 2", Luke will face Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and Chewie need to turn off the power field of the "Death Star 2" ", with the help of the EWOKS. (small creatures that look like little bears) <br /> <br /> This is surely one of the most exciting stellar wars of all!
