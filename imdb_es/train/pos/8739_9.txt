['This is a funny movie. It has all the usual components of Disney (music, great variety of characters, history, appeal), interlaced with magnificent animations and the excellent voices of lesser known actors such as &quot;Antz&quot; and &quot;Price of Egypt&quot;. <br /><br /> The characters work really well and have a strong appeal, and humor is aimed at a broad level that overcomes generational barriers. The film is also presented in a magnificent cinemascope format, which adds to the cinematic experience. <br /><br /> Call me crazy, but I&#39;ve seen the movie three times, and I intend to take more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics have seen this movie on my recommendation and have not been disappointed. I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that nobody has left this movie without a feeling of satisfaction. <br /><br /> See it, and do not be discouraged because it is animated. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy this movie and make sure you stay for the final credits! The bloopers and the shots at the end are the funniest part of the movie, which is full of laughs.']
