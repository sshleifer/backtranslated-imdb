I also saw this movie at the Santa BÃ¡rbara Film Festival. It was an excellent film about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was fun, warm, touching and moving, as well as entertaining. A movie like this would do very well with word of mouth criticism. I would definitely tell my friends and family to watch this movie. Hopefully they have the opportunity. I would rate this movie as one of the best movies I've seen in a year. It does not contain violence, scenes of action, murders, sex, so obviously the distributors question whether or not they should pick it up. Believe me, there are people out there who would love to go see a movie like this that has a redemptive value, instead of the many blockbusters that we normally receive.
