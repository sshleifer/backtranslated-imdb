As for parody movies, there are few that are worth the time and energy. but with a recent resurgence of horrible parodies like Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a truly fun farce like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother has no end of medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the mafia. What follows is a series of gags, most of which work, however, there are occasional failures. But a foreign gangster who can not master the American language (at least with profanity), a rival gangster with a penchant for taking his mouth off (... once!), A younger brother with the D.A. Who wants to catch Johhny Dangerously, and a young and hot young girl for his affections has Johnny busy. <br /> <br /> And the viewer will be busy laughing, for the most part, since every clich√© of gangsters and movies is skewered. for a talented cast and decent writing. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect for a long time, but it's definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
