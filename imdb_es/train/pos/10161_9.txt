I took a brochure to rent this movie, but I must say it was very, very good. On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography and high production values, etc. It shows that Eva Longoria Parker is the head and shoulders in rom / com over the bad actors like Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who assault and call him acting. Who has thought? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are alone in a class in this regard and should try to present themselves for projects as good as "Over Her Dead Body". Lake Bell is also excellent, and this is the first time I've seen it. And, finally, Paul Rudd manages to shine in a really good movie, instead of smaller films. <br /> <br /> A movie like this never gets its quotas from closed-minded men. It is very bad. As other IMDb reviewers have pointed out here, there is nothing wrong with this gem: you do not have to hack writing or acting. <br /> <br /> And his representation of the contemporary L.A. and California, in general, makes each scene look bright, beautiful, clean and, otherwise, exceptional in every way. Never before has a movie made L.A. It looked so good Oh, what a little talent and care can do for a movie. <br /> <br /> I will not divulge the plot, but as an old and long-standing atheist, I was willing to suspend Do not believe and delve into the supernatural theme to enjoy an excellent and cheerful piece of entertainment. It reminds me a lot of the old "Topper" movies, which were also very nice. <br /> <br /> This film exposes popular movies like "Ghost" for mediocre and overly sentimental shit festivals. are. We already know that the taste of the public leans strongly towards the mediocre. However, some of us keep our praises for the truly worthy. <br /> <br /> If you have enjoyed other overlooked gems like "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, "Chances Are" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Doing the Right" with John Malkovich, etc., will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> A top-notch job everywhere (even if it's a bit hard to believe that a straight man can pretend to be gay for more than five years). But even that plot device does not detract from the film excellence in general
