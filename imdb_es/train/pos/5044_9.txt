Bill Paxton stars and directs this highly original film. Having observed the first time I was there because of how good it was. The reviews I had heard were fine. As a result, I expected an average thriller at the most. However, due to Paxton's excellent direction and performance, it's worth watching the movie, especially if you're a horror movie fan. The film also receives help from plot twists that continue to come to the closing credits. The strongest point of the film is the story that I have to say that is very original and is like the one I've seen before. Well done also to the 2 young drivers who perfectly convey the emotions of these confused guys. I give this movie 9/10 and highly recommend that everyone catch it.
