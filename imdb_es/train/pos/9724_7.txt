I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I guess it's the kind of actress that is best not to act before the camera, but to be herself. She did that, and it looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, she tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, to make her look more like a sober editor. While in the other half, she returned completely to her daily trajectory, and I could not tell her that I was an editor in any way. Therefore, his performance does not last in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film, in general, is attractive and inspiring. Young's character is complete and reasonable. Anyway, the movie tells a big and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only big flaw is that it did not show a turning point in the love story of the hero and the heroine. I am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story, because that is not clear to both people.
