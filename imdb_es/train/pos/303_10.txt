Since the day I saw this movie when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my 3 favorites. The propaganda that I wrote for Amazon is below, and I am delighted that it finally comes out on DVD on 10/17/06, the 25th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br /> The last credit of this film explains his appeal: "Thanks to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed." A charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify each location (West 12th Street, Ansonia, the former FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and the boundaries of the city that was a country and western club). One gets the impression that the entire cast clicked as off the screen as on the screen, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not just an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last appearance (she had a cameo after this movie) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. Buy it, make a big tub of popcorn and cuddle with someone you love.
