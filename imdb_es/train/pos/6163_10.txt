['This is one of the few films where I consider that the interpretation of the film is an improvement on the original book. The story is clear, accessible, fun and interesting, and the musical numbers are, without a doubt, exceptional. I adored the cyclic version of &#39;The old home guard&#39; and the charming &#39;Portobello Road&#39;, a great combination of early animation techniques + real actors that, although outdated, do not detract from the charm of the piece. The background of World War II worked well and was not omitted as the film began, which often happens in the stories of the &quot;evacuees&quot;. <br /><br /> A film often too underestimated, that has no end for the enjoyment of people of all ages. The performances of the actors are exceptionally well done and the whole text is perfectly united and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!']
