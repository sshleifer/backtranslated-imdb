The man of the house is a true situation of comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy is about a character named Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O 'Sullivan) who meets after a wild party, and ends up at the home of two ladies named Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party was celebrated to say goodbye to his former roommate. The obvious ends up happening as it moves. <br /> <br /> The man of the house was a cursor before Cooke and Mortimer showed George and Mildred, who introduced the two characters who owned Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually become the key points of the man of the house with Mildred (the last and much missed Yootha Joyce) in particular by getting some of the best lines of the series. A semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher), a useless person who was always in the movement and only came when he wanted to borrow something (and never return it). <br /> <br /> The American made it a version called the company of three, but it has no chance compared to this original much more fun. Thames ran the risk of producing a comedy about a man who shares a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time, but they should worry, since the ratings at that time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to see a bit of comedy traditional. Inspired casting and a sharp script. What a pity that modern comedy can not reach that high level. <br /> <br /> This program is available on the DVD network
