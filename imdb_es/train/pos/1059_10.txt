I LOVE this show, I'm sure it will be a winner. Jessica Alba does a great job, it's about time we have a girl who is not the beautiful type. All the cast is wonderful and all the episodes have good plot. Everything is well distributed and thought out. Putting it together must have taken a while, because it was not someone in a hurry that just hit something. It is a GREAT show together.
