Gómez Pereira is responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of the most recent Spanish cinema (just take a look at his curriculum vitae), so I did not expect much from "Things That Do ..." ... In fact, I do not know why in the world I decided to see it. Anyway, I just did it ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gómez Pereira has finally matured and is now capable of making a good movie. His latest work deals with the crisis of middle age, disappointment and the search for a second chance after having ruined everything. The last half hour of the movie (the most dramatic) is the best part, and it just makes it worth seeing. We also have Eduard Fernández in the main role, and I still think he is the best actor of his generation (by far). <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
