Cinderella ... <br /> <br /> I had not seen this movie for about five years the last time I saw it. The magic remains. There is something that definitely contains that story book feeling, the songs are entertaining and the secondary character is all please. The villains in the form of stepsisters are perfectly evil and vile. Then there's the most magical of all of Disney, the mice that make the dress, and you know the rest. In short, the four Disney princess movies are great, but this is a lovely magical experience, look and enjoy. Oh, and of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. With Elene Wood and others, the movie has that feeling, you just can not help but smile. <br /> <br /> They say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course, in the real world, some are believers, others are hoper. In this movie it is even more magical when his rainbow smiles. <br /> <br /> And of course the rest is ... Cinderella
