The 14-year-old boy I have in me is immensely happy that now they can make very good looking fantasy movies, and that they are in style, with Pot of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia doing a lot of things. Cash in the box office. This year we will see (and we have seen) several more, especially The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in theaters this week with little more than a glimpse. I did not see progress, just a couple of announcements. The critical reaction is a bit blah. I would not have even seen it if it were not for the fact that I have to wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing more interesting will be open this weekend. Well, if you forgive the horrible word game, the stars must be aligned correctly, because I went to see Stardust and I loved it. It's not a great movie like The Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to find a fallen star) full of obstacles. But within that basic scheme, the story is animated and imaginative. It simply aims to be a lot of fun and a lovely little romance. And he does it wonderfully. There were a lot of great movies this summer, but none of them was as fun as this one. Many things happen, but the story is well told and is almost totally consistent. It is not a masterpiece, but it can definitely occupy the same type of terrain that has something like The Princess Bride (although I do not like it as much as in the previous movie). Lots of fun here if you're a fan of the genre.
