Yesterday I saw "The Grudge", and wow ... I was really scared, something good. I love horror movies, and I liked it a lot. There were so many scenes of "surprise" (what's the word in English?) That made you jump in your seat. However, too many shouts from the audience made it hard not to laugh. I think the most terrifying scene was ... on the bus, when the face flickers in the window, or when Yoko walks without her chin. The makeup is also VERY good. Sometimes you could really see that he was there, but still he was adding a strange aspect to the scene. The boy was very good, very cute without makeup and so terribly scared with that. The next time I hear a crunch, I'll probably feel pretty scared ...
