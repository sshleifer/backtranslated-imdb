I saw this movie again as a task for my administration class. They should mainly comment on the different styles of management and ideas about the quality (of the product). I rented this in the eighties and I remember it as a good (but not great) movie. I have always liked the style and delivery of Michael Keaton. He adjusted perfectly to the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see some of the low ratings of this movie. I grant you that yes, it is not an Oscar winner, but it has a decent comic value. It is more a subtle comedy than a farce of comedy without limits. I also find some of those who felt that this was an inaccurate film about cultural and business differences. I am sorry I disagree. I grant you again that there are many generalities and dramatizations, but this is a Hollywood movie, not a documentary. From what I have read about the differences between car manufacturers on both sides of the Pacific at that time, many of the main ideas were accurate for the moment. <br /> <br /> Some of the basic differences were those that the Japanese workers made feel. as part of the company as a whole. Emphasis was placed on teamwork. Maybe they made the company above everything else. Where American workers had more than one management verses of labor type of relationship. The individual was more important than the company. I'll probably receive a hate email about that comment, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Another difference was the way in which the quality was seen and whose responsibility was to fix it. In many Japanese plants, defects or problems are examined and resolved at the moment they are discovered. Rather, as one character in the film put it, "it was the dealers' problem (that is, the car dealership)." <br /> <br /> It is likely that many of these things are outdated, but I am sure that some of them still have the same amount of EE cars. UU The manufacturers are still struggling to keep up with the Japanese. If one is more interested in the topic of the American, European and Japanese car manufacturers, I can recommend a book that studies this topic in more detail and was carried out approximately in the same period. The book is called "The Machine that Changed the World" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. It is a study of car manufacturers during and before the time period covered by this film. The parts are a bit dry, but I think you'll also find that it supports the movie a lot.
