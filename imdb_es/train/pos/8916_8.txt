Absolutely the first movie that scared me to death. I found it when my older brother (r.i.p.) was watching it. I was on a black and white TV and it was not really a good image, but it interested me. Soon after, my parents bought a game of colors and, as expected, The Million Dollar Movie was showing it on a Sunday. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten most of the plot, but it did not take me long to do it. catch up ... and I got so scared that I had a hard time sleeping that night! I mean, it was just a movie, but it involved a creature that not only came from space, but could not hear it or see it ... and once it caught you it was too late. Even now, after all this time, my back still trembles. A true classic, and even better a classic that I've seen scare the pants of a new generation! <br /> <br /> Long live The Blob!
