['If there was ever an inspiring story that could move any person, disabled or not, to persevere despite the odds and do it (even when &quot;doing it&quot; as an expression, properly speaking, it can have a wide margin that is a truth in last personal instance), MY LEFT FOOT is that. It&#39;s a difficult movie to watch at times: seeing the less placid aspects of Christy Brown&#39;s personality emerge in two key scenes: one when her sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while her father has a bad reaction, and at a dinner table when the woman who approached him, made him able to communicate effectively, now announced at a key moment (the opening of Brown&#39;s art) that he is about to marry another man: it is difficult. Very, very hard. Even more so because he is a man who can not react according to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows: through screams, shrieks and blasphemies aimed at hurting himself. However, this is not a story of family distress and dysfunction, even when there is enough of what the autobiographical account provides, but that of a man who overcomes his severe disability, becomes a functioning human being and a force to be considered in history. world of art. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful and unforgettable performance as the faulty but tenacious Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker also did it for her supporting role as Brown&#39;s strong mother.']
