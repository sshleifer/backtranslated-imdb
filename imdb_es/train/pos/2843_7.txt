If you're not in the mood for a movie that's more than an hour away, this movie might give you some variations. What I love are the surprises in progress. It's not just once that you want to continue with one or more of the 'New York I Love You' short films. Yes, some of the short films make you curious, some of them very short, some longer, some have defined ends, others do not. <br /> <br /> Most of the story presents The sad side of the capital city. It shows many different nationality backgrounds. Many of them make me feel the same way I once went to a capital city in other countries during a year in which many people from different countries have come. This movie explores many types of things you might have known, but for all the characters it's something new. Maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay a year or two just to feel something new, meet new people; feel dreamer, sad, but the kind of sadness you are looking for because it is simply how boring you were in your own home. You may want to relive it again, seeing this.
