The first time I came across 'My Tutor Friend' a year or two ago was while I was on TV. Before that, I had never seen Korean movies in my life, so MTF was really the first Korean movie I saw. And what a lovely surprise! I had a lot of fun from beginning to end and I had a lot of fun laughing. His comedic style is quite different from those of the Hong Kong comics movies (which I have been used to all my life and, therefore, I have also gotten tired), breathing fresh air in my visual movie experience. I thought there are quite a few scenes and tricks in MTF that are quite funny, ingenious and original too. <br /> <br /> I looked at MTF for the second time a few days ago, and after having seen it once, the surprise / comic effect on my type of mitigated. That, however, has in no way negatively affected my opinion of the film. Instead, something else came up at this moment, I was moved, the story about how two young people, apparently 'enemies' that are completely incompatible come together, and how they gradually resolve their differences and begin to take care of each other without realizing the feelings. to themselves, reminds me of the days of high school that have gone. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are really compatible, since both have something that is pure and genuine within them, a quality that separates them from people like, for example, the brazen girlfriend of Ji Hoon. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two distinct parts: the first part is about the "fight" between Su Wan and Ji Hoon, and is more violent and faster. After Ji Hoon gets a pass on his final exam and Su Wan dances the provocative dance (in Ji Hoon's opinion), things start to change. The pace slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes that he cares for Su Wan more than he could ever imagine. So the second part deals with the development of their mutual feelings, which leads, of course, to a happy ending accompanied by a final confrontation with the leader of the gang. <br /> <br /> Just one last comment. I think this is a bit incredible. The fact that a 21-year-old self-proclaimed 'bad boy' feels embarrassed about being almost naked in front of the girl who kills and loses his 'cool' is just a little .... odd. I guess that shows that Ji Hoon is just a pure-hearted guy and it's not really what his appearance looks like. By the way, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) has a sexy body and a perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on my list of the 10 best favorite movies of all time.
