['I totally disagree with the other reviews. All basically negative. I took a risk in this movie and I&#39;m glad I did it. I&#39;m glad. I could not find anything wrong with her. No period The script is original. The actors are all nice and convincing. Dee Smart reminded me of Brady Bunch&#39;s Marcia Brady. But this girl can really act. The environment in the Australian interior is perfect. An incredible landscape. A great soundtrack, that is, Paul Kelly. God bless Paul Kelly. The Cranberries are also here. I&#39;ve seen this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I&#39;ll probably see her again. It is so interesting. It makes you think. It&#39;s (probably) better than nine-tenths of the so-called Hollywood box office hits. They were also published during this time. Back Of Beyond is a nice guy. Well photographed film. I could not find anything wrong with it. Discover it! My first comment!']
