Although it is certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk, Dudley Moore's portrait of adorable beauty makes Arthur Bach can not help but feel this unique and wonderful character. How is it possible that you do not entertain yourself with that contagious laugh and your laughter and nonsense? Although I'm not really a fan of Liza Minnelli, she was really excellent, since Linda Marolla and I could not imagine anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar. The rest of the cast also excellent and that great melody "Arthur's Theme", wow. Truly this was one of the best comedies of the eighties. The great films improve with each visualization and that is the case of "Arthur".
