Like many people on this site, I saw this movie only once, when it was first televised in 1971. Certain scenes remain in my memory and a general sense of uneasiness is how I remember that affected me. I would love to see him again if he were ever available for the home video. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic configuration of the plot and the characters could have been derived from a British film of 1960, originally entitled City of the Dead, renamed Horror Hotel for the launch in the United States? There are also some similarities with a later British film, The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> A detail remains with me years after watching the film. It's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the movie. As I recall, a minister and his wife have stopped to help some people on the side of the road, around 1870, somewhere in the west. The friendly Ray Milland seems to present himself and his (daughter?), Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young mute. While the preacher is helping Ray Milland with the car, a rattlesnake is seen and rolled threatening, without being observed by any of the characters, except Yvette Mimieux. She does not seem scared at all, but stares at the snake with silent concentration, until she leaves. With this small and strange moment, we already realize that there is something very unusual in these apparently normal people, although the possible danger for the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> That little scene remains with me vividly after all these years, along with many others. The film has a disquieting quality that will not let it pass, and it is not surprising that people remember it so vividly. Someone should make this available for the home video!
