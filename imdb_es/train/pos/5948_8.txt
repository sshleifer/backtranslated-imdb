Some of the posters seem less than grunts because this is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart, but clearly does not pretend to be either. You'll find a long time to find a fan of Rodgers and Hart older than me, but Burke and Van Heusen were not exactly chopped liver, plus they met Der Bingle completely and adapted some great songs, but Beautiful, Moonlight Becomes You, Always You, The Day After Forever, etc. - to adapt to their highly personal style and here they come up with another ballad, Once and For Always, once again, plus a couple of optimistic entries of light philosophy in If you hit your toe on the moon and not busy doing nothing. The flimsy plot is not meant to be taken seriously. Why, if not, does Merlin be heavy when in most, if not all, of the other versions, it is more a friend / mentor of Arthur? Then, if you start wondering out loud why Sir Lancelot, who has sold himself to historians as the epitome of chivalry and rectitude metamorphosis into a bully from the school yard who will not get much fun from what he is essentially a funny movie. After all, he does what he sets out to do, entertain, good luck.
