An owner of a million-dollar tea plantation drags a beautiful London saleswoman and soon finds herself married and living with him in her villa in British Ceylon. Although based on Robert Standish's book, this initial configuration is reminiscent of Hitchock's "Rebecca", with the protagonist Elizabeth Taylor colliding with the mansion's imposing chief of staff and (almost immediately) her own husband, who is still under the thumb of his deceased but dominant father. Taylor, a last-minute substitute for Vivien Leigh, looks very soft in her haute couture wardrobe and her performance is quite strong; however, once husband Peter Finch begins to drink a lot and shouts orders, one might think that his dedication to him is quite masochistic (this feeling also hinders the ending). Still, the film offers a lot of interest for soap lovers: romantic drama, a little travel notebook, interpretive dance, a stampede of elephants and a cholera outbreak at the right time. *** since ****
