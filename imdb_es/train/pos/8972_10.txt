My discovery of the cinema by Jan Svankmajer opened My eyes to a whole tradition of Czech animation, of which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the best technically most impressive animated films I've seen. <br /> <br /> A potter wakes up and waters his plant. Then a pot is made. But the huge hand that hits the pot comes and demands that the potter make a statue of himself. He extends his hand, but soon returns and locks him in a bird cage where he is forced to sculpt a hand of stone. He dedicates himself to it, faints from exhaustion, but finally completes the task. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful metacinema sequence, the potter uses a candle to burn the strings of visible puppets, which keep him enslaved, and escapes back home. He locks himself up and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, unlike modern films that strive to be realistic (why?). The hand, for example, is clearly someone's hand in a glove. Everything else is clay. Chains are visible and are part of the narrative, so it is a precursor to the film Chains. The atmosphere is creepy: that hand that chases the little potter managed to instill more fear in me than many horror movies combined. <br /> <br /> The film is obvious, but avoid being totally manipulative because of its simplicity. It's a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny that can not help win the hearts and minds of anyone who has freedom as a natural right.
