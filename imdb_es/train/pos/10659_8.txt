"I like the cheap perfume more, it does not last that long ..." - The convicted character of Ralph Meeker (Lawson) tells this to the character Helen of Barbara Stanwyck, after she perceives the smell of the perfume that she chose with her husband in tijuana ...! This line cracked me, and it also seemed like a metaphor for this movie: how cheap is better than expensive, because a cheap man who loves perfumes who has a form with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have in the long term. ! I agree with some of the other comments posted about the attraction of Helen to Lawson. Even though her narrative says she wants Lawson to be rejected, she seemed attracted by his fiery nature, and that passion he woke up in her probably would not go away with the tide!
