"SÃ¥ som in himmelen" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful movies I've ever seen. That he did not win the Oscar, I will not shed a tear. This movie belongs to a class of its own, that an Oscar victory would have possibly downplayed it !! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg), you have made true magnificence with your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation and everyone contributing, you have all given a gift of Love to our world. Between the points to enter this world of ours and then get out of it, you can really say that you improved it! A special personal thank you from my soul to all of you for bringing some precious memories of the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young mind and being present was formed and formed by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with gratitude to all of you. With love and light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
