['I really liked this movie. I rented it expecting something not so bad as to spend a night. It turned out to be a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were fun and they managed to be in a movie that does not pretend to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral values. It is handled in both aspects. All the protagonists are good, but especially the guy who stars, also wrote and produced the movie. I had never seen any of these actors before, but they were nice and made me worry about what happens to them in the end, which is a lot. The script is intelligent and enveloping, and has a refreshing feel. . I think you will not be disappointed to see this.']
