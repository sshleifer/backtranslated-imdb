You are using IMDb. <br /> <br /> You have given some strong votes to some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> It's something you enjoy doing. <br /> <br /> And everything is for this. Fifty seconds One world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How can you not give him a ten? I ask those who give this seven or eight ... exactly, how could it be BETTER THE FIRST MOVIE THAT HAS BEEN DONE? For the record, the long and open shot is a great skill for the show, an excellent innovation, perfectly adapted to the situation. And the dog on the motorcycle is a lovely touch. All this within fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius is often used to excess. <br /> <br /> THIS IS genius.
