Seeing how the two brothers interact and feed each other throughout the film makes me personally happy to live in the rural area as they did in the film. I have seen this movie countless times and I have the book right next to my Bible. After watching the movie, I agree that this is one of the few films that does justice to a book. I highly recommend anyone who has the opportunity to go to Montana to fish or be outdoors to do so. It's amazing. I can not think of anyone else who can play the role better than Brad Pitt. Do yourself justice and watch one of the best movies of the modern cinema era. RECOMMENDEDLY recommend And as a guide for fishing trips in both Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn to fly fish in the scenes of the film because, although it looks great in the movie, you have no idea how much practice and practice is fishing. It actually takes. Thank you for listening. Watch this movie, please, if you want a long and sad movie.
