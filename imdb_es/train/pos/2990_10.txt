I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars, but, apart from him, I've never read a positive critique of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions, love and sacrifice (three issues that most great romantic stories or movies have in common). <br /> <br /> Here the main theme is the division of classes. Stella is a story from the time of the American Depression. That said, it was translated to the screen in such a memorable way that this remake (if you ask a Stanwyck fan or two) was not appreciated exactly. The fans of the original never gave him a chance. In addition, this version of Stella was made in the 1990s, it is not exactly a time of great financial problems in the United States (as was the depression). <br /> <br /> Now is the time to remove the pink glasses, in the middle of a new era of recession and poverty in the United States, and see that this powerful story still comes true, it is so timely and relevant as always, in its updated format. <br /> <br /> Yes, class division is the key. main theme here. Stella is one of the poor, single workers, with big dreams but with little hope of realizing those dreams. She works in a bar, does not have much money, lives in a horrible apartment. You have the drift. In the morning, she really does not want to get out of bed. On his wall, pictures of movie stars that she idolizes. <br /> <br /> A man sees her dancing in the bar. He's rich, educated, from one of those upper-class families that has nothing in common with Stella's. Her main concern is which ivy league university to attend, her is how to pay the rent, how to be "happy". They have a love affair. They like each other Stella ends up pregnant. Stella tells the boy the news. Your answer? "How about an abortion?" She replies: "I just wanted a room full of balloons." He supplies the balloons and the proposal, but she sees that her heart is not in that, and she has too much pride to accept. She sends him to pack. <br /> <br /> His daughter finally struggles between the two lifestyles: the love she has for her mother and the advantages, happiness and love that her rich father offers her. Stella, alone and without love, and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as she one day, makes the ultimate sacrifice. She abandons the only love and happiness she has known to ensure her daughter's happiness, and perhaps live indirectly, and with hope, knowing that at least her daughter found something to live on. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie. Everything is fine about it. Beautiful score, artistic cinematography, excellent stage design (contrast between the two lifestyles, the messy apartment and the decorated mansions), wonderful and sincere performances of the entire cast, with Bette Midler, in particular, worthy of an Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is a much more important and better made movie than you have been led to believe.
