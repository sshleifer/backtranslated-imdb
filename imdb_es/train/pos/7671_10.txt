Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs has done it again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years waiting for Kabal, an evil sorcerer, to come and kill him. Mordrid and Kabal used to train together as children, so Mordrid knows all the Kabal tricks. <br /> <br /> The movie seems a bit confusing at first, but soon you feel part of the action. I'm not going to reveal the ending, so go see Dr. Mordrid. <br /> <br /> I found that the movie is very nice because it does not have much violence or sexual scenes. The film focused on the plot and that's what I like! It seems to me that the best movies are those in which times fly by. This is because you are so absorbed in the movie. Doctor Mordrid is a fantastically fascinating film! I give it a 20 out of 10. It's worth seeing! <br /> <br />
