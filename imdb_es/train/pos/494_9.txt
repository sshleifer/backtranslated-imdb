This is the beginning of an interesting new Star Trek series. It has a "realistic" type with a darker and less "unpleasant" scenography. <br /> <br /> The characters need more time to develop, but they have potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (with the entire Star Trek series in reality) is that they represent such a grim picture of equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive image of everything else. (The Earth has stopped the war, the hunger, etc.) <br /> <br /> The female characters here are two, the subcommander T'Pol who is vulcan and the communications officer Hoshi, who is human. Hoshi is quite weak and T'Pol is made to be a "vulcano baby". <br /> <br /> Some of the crew's attitudes feel a bit too American (unlike the more international feel of the TNG crew) but it creates interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> A very good driver, although for a very good series.
