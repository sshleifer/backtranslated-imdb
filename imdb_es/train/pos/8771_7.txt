ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the cheeky braggart of an Irish wrestling family who became the world's heavyweight champion at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) claimed he "could beat any man" . live. "Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably one of the best performances they ever did on the screen. <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh has directed the colorful tale with a robust style, capturing family life and the scenes that are warm, hearty and full of humor All the players hired by Warner make up the excellent cast, including the always reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's cunning father, proud of his son's fighting skills, and ALEXIS SMITH, who makes the most of her role as a sociable girl in society who enjoys tearing Flynn down a peg with line sausages that deal with his deceptive manners. <br /> <br /> The whole atmosphere of the 1880s is captured in a glorious B & W, although it is a pity that the Warners did not have more faith in Flynn to make the film in color, he was entering a rock phase of his film career at that time, participating in a trial by A widely publicized iolation that had all the tabloid newspapers busy sorting things out. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are among the best choreographed for The Screen, with Flynn obviously in good shape and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. And the scene in which Bond delivers his award plaque to Flynn at a social gathering is one of Ward's best moments in a long career as a character actor. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Keep interest at all times, whether you're a fan of sports or not.
