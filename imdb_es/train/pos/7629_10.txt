['Kurt Russell is Elvis, simple and simple. His dedication to this role resulted in what I think is the best biography of the film. If you&#39;re a Elvis fan, see if you can. <br /><br /> The film made for television was made two years after the death of Elvis. <br /><br /> A tip, there are two versions: one at 180 minutes and another at 117 minutes. The only one to look at is the longest. The shortest has more than one hour of edited images. It just does not work because the scenes it contains often depend on the scenes that were cut. <br /><br /> This masterpiece takes you from Elvis&#39; childhood to his appearance as the best entertainment star. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt&#39;s true father) are excellent as Elvis&#39;s parents. And Pat Hingle delivers a very competent Colonel Tom Parker. <br /><br /> Long live the king!']
