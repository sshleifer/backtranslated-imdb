I can not say that this film deserves almost the same amount of vitriol that some critics accumulate. Yes, it is jammed by an excessively quilted runtime, a boring edition and an overconfidence in the special effects of the cheese ball. And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs for its average audience to sit without looking at their watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it also has some funny lines of laughter to laughter, a talented and serious cast, and the classic premise of losers. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are brilliant as the "central" team, and Garofalo and Studi do an excellent job that adds conflict and variety to the team. I can not say that Reubens or Mitchell added much to the film in general, although each had some opportunities to shine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said before, is your classic "devalorist does good". There are no surprises there, since you know that they will succeed. What makes it worthwhile are not the absurd and flashy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interaction between the characters. Below all, these people are children at heart, who just want to do the right thing. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional basis. Look at Azaria's relationship with her suffering mother; Macy's charming innocence in her unwillingness to accept Cap. The secret identity of Amazing; Stiller's rage (not unlike that weird and dazzling kid you once knew and who always had trembling and helpless rage in the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge his father. This childish belief that a sense of justice and kindness will always make the world a better place, is the true attraction of superhero comics; and below its parodic exterior, "Mystery Men" shows us why these trite comics tropes are important to many. <br /> <br /> It never really becomes a satisfactory whole, due to the large number of semi-sub-parcels (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is so funny that it compensates. The fact that it's supposed to be good, senseless fun seems to have been lost in some of the reviewers here, so I'll issue a warning: if you're the kind of spectator who finds your enjoyment of a ruined Itchy and Scratchy caricature for the inexplicable and illogical ("Should I believe that this is some kind of ... * snort * ... _magic_xylophone?"), then you are too literal and humorless for this movie. Go rent a Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
