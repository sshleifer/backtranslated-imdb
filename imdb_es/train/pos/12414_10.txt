The first American film by Renny Harlin was one of the best horror films set in the prison (like "Death House" or "The Chair") in the late 1980s. Twenty years earlier, guard Lane Smith had unjustly executed a condemned. Now, he is the director of the newly reopened prison, and the man's ghost has returned to avenge himself with blood. This atmospheric and very moody film presents a lot of gore and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are hand in hand with the entertaining butchery.
