OK - as for the 2 versions of this movie. There were 2 people involved in the making: John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was the producer, he had nothing to say in the movie, he only helped with money): the "Adult" version was possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or approve this version (as was done behind his back). Thanks to the fact that Ladd's films went down, they did not publicize this movie and they released all their advertising money for "The Right Stuff", hoping that it would help them, and it did not. So, this movie never had the chance. When "Twice" came to cable (HBO), they showed the reels with Bill's version and John threatened to sue if it was already showing (did you notice that the "adult" version was not on for a long time?). Showtime has the 'clean' version. The version on the videotape and the laser disk is the version approved by John (who has more power than Bill). It's a shame, really, since the "adult" version is really better and YES makes more sense. But it is VERY doubtful that it will ever be released in that version on DVD (or in any other format other than bootleg). I'm sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this information, since I used to be the president of the Twice Upon A Time Fan Club (I still have many items from the movie, I used to own a card version of the adult version, but it was stolen, just have a partial HBO copy of it now). 8 stars to the 'adult' version - 5 to the 'clean' version. Any other question, just ask.
