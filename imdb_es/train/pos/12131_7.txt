The film is about Philip (Leslie Howard) who is a serious but disabled medical student. He falls fatally in love with a predatory and ruthless waitress named Mildred (Bette Davis). She leaves him, talking to others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he is in love with other suitors (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee) but she returns in a mutually destructive affair. <br /> <br /> Easily the best and the first of numerous movie versions of the Somerset Maugham novel. Bette Davis as the cruel Cockney waitress, who won another magnificent performance with a seductive and ardent performance, absolutely hypnotic in her tale of slavery that occurs from the beginning to the end. David rose to stardom with his performance. Your role as tough and rude The dominant woman will repeat herself several times in the subsequent performance. Leslie Howard, as the essentially good and decent student who was subtly destroyed, offers an excellent and melancholy performance. He was an incredible actor (Gone with the Wind) as well as a producer and writer, and he died in a plane crash during World War II. Both will play again in "Primed forest" (1936). The atmosphere of the film is recreated in an elaborate way in the studio RKO (Radio Picture Inc) is totally convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The film will appeal to classic moviegoers. Rating: Very good but a little outdated.
