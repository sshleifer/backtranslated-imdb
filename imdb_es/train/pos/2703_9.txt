I'm not a big fan of kitsch camp and the kind of visualization "so bad that it's good". However, I really like this movie because of its fun factor and, believe it or not, it's innovation. <br /> <br /> Everything has a ring of John Waters and is infinitely enthusiastic, but with some excellent and considerate actors. Direction making the most of slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Zane moves with an incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a textbook lesson on how to use the movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not like this movie, you may not enjoy it, but if you have the opportunity to watch it, it saves time because you are likely to end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humor of some big stars. Highly recommended.
