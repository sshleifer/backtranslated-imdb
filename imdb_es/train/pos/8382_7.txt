If you like war games, mech is pretty good. Part of this is cheap, but it's worth watching the robot fights. I have enjoyed the field of mech war for some time and this is practically the only movie I have seen that comes close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. If you like genres, then the games you like are Mech Warrior Three and four and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 for the Steel Battalion. The movie is worth seeing at least once. It really needs to be more movies on the same subject. Less remakes and more original works. <br /> <br /> enjoy
