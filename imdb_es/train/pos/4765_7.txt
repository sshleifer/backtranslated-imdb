A priest who has left his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordained. <br /> <br /> This film is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures. In post-war France it is also about the mortal aspect of faith. <br /> <br /> This may not be the movie of a lifetime, but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall into oblivion. In addition, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
