I can not help but say how much I loved this movie. This movie is one of the least known and one of the most fun I've seen in my life. The film follows the exploits of a rap group, NWH (Ni # $% rs with hats) It goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group, after its tragic break. Following the group is the documentary maker Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The movie has a small budget, but it does not seem to matter, this is a very well made movie, well produced and the performances of all these actors and actresses are excellent. The main strength of this film is the writing, there are so many bright lines and takeoffs in rap in this film, it is unreal. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> There are takeoffs in real rappers, like MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste and songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick, Etc. .) Rusty Condieff has made an excellent movie. In the movie he plays rapper Ice Cold. The film does not stop, it's funny from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The film works very well because sometimes it becomes extravagant, but it hits that line where it's funny without going too far. Listening to the three protagonists, trying to talk about some kind of philosophy, was one of the best parts of the film, as Tone Def told a record producer "when you take the bus, you get there," and the producer replies " That's deep! <br /> <br /> The group that portrays NWH has some kind of natural chemistry for them, they work very well together, and they manage to get this film out of where there is not a moment of the week in the What really makes this film so good is how faithful to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is, many rap groups had problems with violence, with censors, and like NWA, the group only became popular when the establishment started doing a lot with the controversial lyrics. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it's offensive There's something here to offend everyone in a good way The movie has a takeoff in a good number of people it was also to rap, the most fun being of Spike Lee. Where they came from with this dialogue I can not imagine. The movie has line after line that will make you roll on the floor. As I said before, the writing is excellent. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this movie has had such a limited release. It is an intelligent film, controversial and even provocative of thoughts. This is too much for the mainstream, although it is hilarious and almost impeccable in its production. There are no important stars, but there are many familiar faces, such as Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Watch this movie, at least you will definitely have an opinion of it.
