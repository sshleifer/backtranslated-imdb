['If only ALL the animation was that great. This film is classic because it is strong, it has two simple aspects: history and character. The characters in this movie are beautifully personified. I felt for all the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the film works perfectly. The beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation have not worked better in any other movie. This is a great movie for children and adults who want the journey of a classic hero. 8 out of 10']
