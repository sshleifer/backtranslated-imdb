I watched, fascinated and hypnotized, by the vocal and physical performance. The roles played by each character were performed with excellence. The letters, the words, every gesture, the dawn, said it all. The movie spoke to me. It enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and good behavior. They also kept me incredulous, because sacrifices and human dignity were portrayed. Power without grace, is insane and without feelings. Wanting power at the expense of humanity is so incredible. This movie made me feel so scared for people who are no longer in this world. And, it is with sadness that I think of them. I like this movie for conversations and expressions in the face of everything. May this film be blessed.
