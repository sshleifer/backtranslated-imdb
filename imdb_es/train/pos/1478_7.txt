I liked this movie, although halfway, I could tell who was the secret admirer. <br /> <br /> I also wonder if it was based on a real story, since it spoke of "real" people. at the end of the movie. I guess I'll have to investigate and let you know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember in what state this happened? I think they moved to North Carolina if I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course, the states could have changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> You would think that this man could I have discovered it as easily as I did. Was he stupid or what?
