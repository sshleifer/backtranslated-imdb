['When you read the summary of this film, you may think that it is a strange movie and, in a way, it is, since the main character of this film is Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé), persecuted by visions and hallucinations. The visions that Gerard sees are all (more or less) subtle clues of what will happen to him as the story continues and it is very amusing for the viewer to try to discover the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and a couple of clues about the end of the film, the film maintains a very high level of emotion at all times and does not get boring for a minute. This is mainly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of the set of Paul Verhoeven. His style of direction is clearly visible and it can be said, looking at it from different angles, that &#39;De Vierde Man&#39; is a typical Verhoeven movie. Not only will it look typical for people familiar with their American films due to nudity and violent graphic scenes, but it will also seem typical for people familiar with their Dutch films, for the same things and their talent for telling a great story. . When people watch American Verhoevens movies, as myopic people would say, they have no talent for telling a good story and only focus on blood and sex. That&#39;s what some people think, while I think he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each film. Although it&#39;s not a good movie, Hollow Man (his last American movie) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more different films to direct. He needs that. Just watch his Dutch movies. Not only do they show that they need some freedom, but they also show that they have a remarkable talent. &#39;De Vierde Man&#39; took him one step closer to Hollywood and is undoubtedly one of his best. <br /><br /> 8 out of 10']
