I discovered that this is a romance / drama that has a nice ending and a nice general feeling. It is not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame family movie with a behavior of "sleeping before marriage" considered a "normal" behavior, but considering that it is starring Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a much rougher movie, less in terms of language. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is the description of how difficult it must be to learn to read and write when you are already an adult. That is the great theme of the film and involves some touching scenes, but, to be honest, the movie is not so memorable. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty smooth and nice story that I would be happy to recommend. .
