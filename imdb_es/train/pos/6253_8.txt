This movie is great. As has often been heard, it is certainly very realistic and, at times, brutal, but unlike other people, I clearly do not think it is depressing, negativistic or that it dismantles Austria as a proto-fascist society. Quite the contrary: although there are very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters must be called very bad people, at the same time you see love, beauty and humor in the film by Ulrich Seidls. And that is exactly what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE from other films that try to show the life of "ordinary people" in an intense and realistic way; his hustle, his desires, his dark sides: Seidl clearly never tries to prove that the lives of working-class people are garbage! In my opinion, the viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid to admit that almost no one's life is as "clean" and "normal" as we would like other people to believe. And that every life has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene: the old Viennese, looking at his old dancer "in the Oriental way", as he calls it. I think that everyone who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask what it is, that is proto-fascist: the characters of HUNDSTAGE or spectators, who are turned off by the body of a woman over 70 years old, dancing With All its charms for your lover.
