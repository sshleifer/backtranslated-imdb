Throughout this movie, you might think that this movie is only for children. Well, it's mostly geared towards them, but it's also complete enough with the jokes also aimed at the adults in the audience. On this occasion, the band of the Muppets tries to reach Broadway, with the terrible difficulties that prevent them from occurring, which leads them to separate. But Kermit will not stop, and his determination makes things go on until, after getting the agreement, a car runs over him and sends him to amnesia! <br /> <br /> It's a shipment, in part, of those old vehicles protagonists of the 40s, with the musicals actually as the theme of a musical, only that here there is a lot of madness and wonderful moments in a boat. of hysterically funny moments (the boomerang fish of Lou Zealand, the Gonzo acrobatics exhibition, the campaign of whispers, among many others), but also with a lot of heart. The muppets writers are not shy of the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it is almost refreshing to see a story of "let's put on a show" in which, through the thickness, they think that the characters will fulfill their dream. <br /> <br /> Although not as original in its scope as Muppet Movie, it has many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations throughout Manhattan, and even some intonation of quotations (and marriage) between species. Cameos include Liza Minneli ("a frog?"), Elliot Gould (as the cop), Brooke Shields (proposed by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing, or just enjoy lots of laughter and romantic moments (yes, romantic) with one of the best Muppet movies.
