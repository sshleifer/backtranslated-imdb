This series is set one year after the mission to Abydos in the movie Stargate. It explains many of the things that the movie forgot to mention. For example, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did the Goa'uld come from (Ra's race)? How many there are? <br /> <br /> The first episode has a Jack O'Neill retreat (written with 2 L) called to active duty by General George Hammond due to a Stargate attack closed by Apophis, a powerful Goa'uld who He killed four men and kidnapped a woman. We meet with Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who says she should have crossed the Stargate the first time, and is determined to do so now. We discovered that Daniel got married in Abydos and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can dial. Then Daniel's wife is captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /> <br /> It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC that includes nine teams, in which the team of Jack will be the SG-1, consisting of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, a homeworld of Goa'uld to rescue Daniel's wife and another captured in Abydos called Ska'ra. They are captured and, just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a Jaffa named Teal'c, First Primer of Apophis, saves them and goes to Earth with them, where he is part of SG-1. <br /> <br /> That was just the beginning of the adventure. In the course of the show, they have gone to the past and the future, they have been transported to alternative realities, they have exchanged bodies, they have aged, they have met with alien races that include a rebellious alliance of Goa'uld called Tok'ra, in the one who becomes Samantha's father. a member, the Asgard, a beautiful little race in which we see Thor more frequently (he is Jack's friend), and we avoid the global disaster by the skin of his teeth innumerable times. <br /> <br /> The show was canceled recently, but it lasted ten seasons. In season nine, a new enemy named Ori arrived with new powers, new dangers and revealing new mysteries around the Stargate and its creators, the Ancients. Season nine and ten also saw the introduction of two new characters, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a human from another world that brings a new sense of fun to the team. <br /> <br /> Very well produced, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all. A different way to travel around the galaxy and different types of adventures, this is a show you will not want to miss. Unlock the door and go through. You will not regret!
