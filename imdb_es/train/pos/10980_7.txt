I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago, and it's been stuck in my head ever since. It is carried out by two fascinating characters in what unfortunately is a mediocre documentary. To get the true story of the Beales, I had to read all the material and the extra comments on the DVD and search the web. <br /> <br /> Although the Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie) bristles at the suggestion that this film is exploitative, this is exploitation in the true sense of the word. Little effort is made to explain to the Beales or how they arrived at the condition in which they were. Maysles' approach seems to be simply turning on the camera and waiting for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous. The sound, even in the reissue of the Criterion is poor and difficult to follow. Although I appreciate that this film has been done a bit at the beginning of the history of the documentary, it is ironic to compare it with the very superior series of Geraldo Rivera on the sexual abuse of patients with mental retardation at the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island from 1972 , four years. before Gray Gardens was shot. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase a review in the New Yorker, there were many things that Edith and Edie needed in their lives, and a documentary was not one of them. <br /> <br /> As for Edith and Edie, what they thought while watching the movie was "where the hell is your family"? They lived in dangerous, unhealthy and insecure conditions. How is it possible that Jackie O, married to one of the richest men on Earth (or Bouvier's own family) could not afford Edith and Edie to have a decent home? Or at least hire a housekeeper or part-time caretaker to come and watch the two of you? It is shameful and a lasting shame for the whole Bouvier family. <br /> <br /> Although this review may seem negative, I would strongly recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries. Maybe someday someone will come and make a documentary about this documentary, presenting the rich background story (and after the story) of the Beales and the whole subsection of the Hamptons society in the 70s.
