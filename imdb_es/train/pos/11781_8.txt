The documentary presents an original theory about "Weapons, germs and steel". The series graphically describes several episodes that strongly support the theory and defend the theory against common criticism. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised to find comments from users complaining about the lack of new information in this series. They say that the documentary presents information that is taught in the middle school. In fact, it does. In fact, I really enjoyed the original aspect of the information I had known since high school and the unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> Then, if you like to know WHY things work, if you have disassembled the phone trying to determine how it worked, if you went to the farm to see how the farms work and how the cows are milked, You will enjoy this series. A definitive recommendation.
