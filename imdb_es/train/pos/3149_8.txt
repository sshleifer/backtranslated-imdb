['Not since The Simpsons made his debut, there has been a comedy he did not want to change in just 2 minutes. Of course, it has been said that The Simpsons killed comedy. Although this one does not. <br /><br /> The first season was like that, since the teenage characters were not as outrageous as they were later. They even went to school sometimes. The following seasons the character vanished. Eric, the sarcastic imbecile, Donna, his sensible girlfriend, Kelso, the dim bulb, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, Fez, the perverted exchange student and, finally, Jackie, the pampered and spoiled. As for the adult characters, there was Eric&#39;s mother, &quot;can you believe she&#39;s so smart?&quot;, The mother of the suburbs, Eric&#39;s father, the straight arrow that, of course, was not as hard as it seemed , Donna&#39;s dumb father and his silly blonde. mom. All are faithful to their characters, but special congratulations to Kurtwood Smith, who finds the perfect balance between the hardness and still makes his Red Forman very friendly without making us vomit with unexpected beauty. <br /><br /> Topher Grace is, of course, the main reason why this show is so good. It is a difficult character to interpret because it does not allow the actor to be carried away by wild exaggeration as the character of Kelso, interpreted competently by Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed watching the two characters interact because they are the most different. <br /><br /> The character of Hyde is a little harder to enjoy because it is more realistic and we really need to see the story of the orphans for the umpteenth time, although I will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story in recent seasons. <br /><br /> Jackie, played by the Family Guy voice artist, Mila Kunis, is very funny and has nails in a slate-type voice, which actually fits her character. The only sad part is that we did not see more scenes with her and Eric because they were so fun ... together. Too much history was wasted in the problems of their relationship, since we got it with Eric and Donna. <br /><br /> Finally I will say that the casting of guest actors was always great. Some favorites: the immense fiancee of Fez in the middle of the season, Pastor Dan, the totally incredible Leo played by the equally astonishing Thomas Chong, another fiancee of Fez who is fully certifiable and a special appearance of the teenage witch Sabrina. Horny Catholic girl. <br /><br /> Coming soon on Fox, whatever.']
