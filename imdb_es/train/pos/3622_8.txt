I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one of the reasons, but the subject of clinging to your dreams speaks to me. People talk about this as a movie for children, but I think it's a movie for baby boomers who are accepting aging, sick parents, our own mortality, our children who grow up and abandon us, and all the other things that we never thought would happen to us. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of tragedy; It's about what it means to live your dreams when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher, but he does look good, and Rachel Griffiths plays a small part as the wife in a thoughtful and layered performance. The camera work is slow and sweet. When they put this movie together, they left out anything that was not necessary. Very nice.
