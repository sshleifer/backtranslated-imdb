Several young Iranians dress as children and try to participate in a qualifying match for the World Cup between Iran and Bahrain. When they are caught, they are locked in an area where the party remains within earshot, but out of sight. The prisoners ask to be let go, but the rules are rules. <br /> <br /> Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disheartening to discover that Offside is a comedy, and often hilarious. In 1997, The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian childhood and leaves the audience wondering which is "real". In 2000, The Circle, several Iranian women leave the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end in the same tragic place. <br /> <br /> However, now thinking of Offside, it is hard to imagine it as anything more than a comedy, because the situation it presents is very obviously ridiculous. While women demand to know why they can not watch the football game and his captors struggle to answer, the only possible result is comedy. <br /> <br /> What most affects Offside is that young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are just football fans and patriots, and even though they are clearly being treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the game and the historic victory that is within their nation's reach.
