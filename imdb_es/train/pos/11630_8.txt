Red Eye is a good thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action. <br /> <br /> It is possible that some do not want to see this movie because it lasts 85 minutes and 88% of the movie is on a plane and is just talking. Do not worry, they do it very well with clever and clever dialogue. <br /> <br /> A PG-13 movie seems to be a new motive for director Wes Craven. But surely, he has conceded as much violence as he possibly can in this thriller. <br /> <br /> This strongest point of this movie is its cast. This film needed good actors to deliver dialogue and emotion. If they did not have those actors, the movie would have been lost and it would be boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Batman's Cillian Murphy begins and 28 days later. Brian Cox, from X-men 2, completes this cast. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this movie was excellent. Just when your thinking is going to get boring, they throw you a turn. Luckily, this is not a long movie and neither do you feel like it. Much better than the flight plan of the other flight movie. <br /> <br /> Here is the comment of my flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend it. It is not too long or too bad. <br /> <br /> 8/10
