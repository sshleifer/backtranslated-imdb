I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about how to find the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) really was a boring guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited to Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James. Anyway, everyone involved in this movie did an absolutely outstanding job. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this sweet, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any fan of Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan who has not seen her. Many laughs await you, so go to the video store, fix it or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
