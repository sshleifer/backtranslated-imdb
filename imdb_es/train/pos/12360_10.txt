I loved the movie. It analyzes perfectly the Italian petty-bourgeois society, how the leftists of the 70s have abandoned all their ideals and have reached a happy settlement that they do not want to be disturbed. For example, the elderly psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son and who does not want to be reminded of his more radical youth. <br /> <br /> For a long time he wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie. A couple of times on the big screen and on television, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy, nobody in the bookstores knew about the movie. A great pity <br /> <br /> The scene of a sex, about which everyone seems to talk, does not hurt the film.
