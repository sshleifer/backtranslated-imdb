Definitely, "House of Games" is not without flaws: hollows in the plot, rigid action, final scenes, but they do little to downplay the fun of watching a thriller that methodically gets your head. "House of Games" does almost everything a good thriller should do. Of course, this is not a great feat given that we are dealing with the world of trusted men and the cons that they commit. Therefore, it is logical that we never really know what is happening, even though we think we do it. But that's what makes the movie worthwhile for those who are games; a film for which the repeated visualizations are indulgences instead of needs. <br /> <br /> It has a defined Hitchcock tilt. The film is based on some similar themes found in his 1964 effort "Marnie", considered a misfire when it was released, but which is now considered one of the most provocative works of the Master. One could easily consider the idea that the character of Lindsay Crouse is the same as that of Tippi Hedrin ... maybe ten years later. Both are loners of strong will, both with compulsive behaviors that force them to walk too close to the shark pool. As Crouse's repressed and tense character says "What is life without adventure?" Put your Reality Check on a low level and enjoy swimming with the sharks!
