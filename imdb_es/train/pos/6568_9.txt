I enjoyed this movie like a child when it came out, and to this day I still do it. A simple story that involves the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally out of the history of the paperback. He has actors who were more recognizable in his day. This should not prevent the viewer from turning it around. Wayne Crawford plays the main character of Jake Speed. Sure, I could bite some elements of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones. But this movie is well made to keep it out of the cellar. I'm surprised that not many people know it. It should have been overshadowed by other movies in theaters in '86. I saw it back then on cable television. It can be hard to find since it is sold out on both VHS and DVD. I managed to get an eBay DVD for less than $ 8! Cool movie
