For years I thought that this incredible service comedy was a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the protagonists. He certainly has the same rough humor of the house with which Ford joins his films. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I knew it was George Stevens who directed it. Still, I refuse to believe that this movie was not offered to John Ford, but he was probably in Monument Valley doing Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., play three sergeants in the Indian Army who have a good fellowship of friends. But the old gang is breaking because Fairbanks is committed to marry Joan Fontaine. Not if his two friends can help him, helped and instigated by the beast of the regiment Gunga Din played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> Rudyard Kipling's poem served as inspiration for this RKO film about the life of barracks in the British Raj. . The comic interpretation of the protagonists is so good that it overcomes the incredibly racist message of the film. Not that the creators were racist, but this was the assumption of the British there at that time, including our leaders and Gunga Din shows it in the most effective way. <br /> <br /> The British took India by increments, making deals here and there with local rulers under a weak Mughal Emperor that was eliminated in the mid-nineteenth century. They ruled very little of India, that would have been impossible. Your government depended on the native troops you see here. Keep in mind that soldiers can not surpass the rank of corporal and Gunga Din has a considerably lower status than that. <br /> <br /> Note that the rebels are indeed Hindus, not Muslims. There are as many tensions of that religion as there are Christian sects and this cult of strangulation was quite real. Of course, for those who are being strangled, they may not have the same vision as the liberators. But until India organized its independence movement, until the Congress Party was created, these people were the voice of a free India. <br /> <br /> But as much as I cut it, strangling people is not a good thing. and the British had their point here too. When I see Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason the main board was created. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant had to play his real true cockney here instead of the urban Cary we're used to seeing. Fairbanks and McLaglen do it very well with roles completely suited to their personalities. <br /> <br /> The best actor role in the film is, however, Eduard Ciannelli as the guru, the boss of the strangler cult. Keep in mind the fire and passion in your performance, make everyone else disappear from the screen when it's on. <br /> <br /> The favorite scene in Gunga Din is that Ciannelli exhorts his troops in his mountain temple. Notice how Stevens progressively obscures the background around Ciannelli until all he sees are eyes and teeth like a macabre Halloween mask. Haunted, terrifying and very effective. <br /> <br /> It was right after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more British public began to question the underlying assumptions that justified the Raj. But that is the theme of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a great movie, entertaining and fun. It should be shown with A passage to India and Gandhi and you can trace how the Indian independence movement evolved.
