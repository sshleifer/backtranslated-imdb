A very interesting entertainment, with the charm of old movies. Tarzan faces the greatest dangers without hesitation if the moment requires it, and we all enjoy his success with him. The most interesting thing for me is that a man without special powers confronts the problems and hits them with only human abilities (he was a great swimmer and had a great cry)
