Carlos Mencia was excellent this is a special time. He was working hard to show everyone that he was the real deal. I know that people have said that they have stolen material in this special, but that is not true. Carlos presents comedy as he wants it, not as anyone wants it, that's why he's so good. People say it's not funny because it says too Dee Dee, and they still have not realized that's part of their act, and they do not want it that way, but he does it anyway, and he manages to make it the people laugh For all the enemies out there, here is a message, Carlos is here to stay, there is no point in trying to shoot him down.
