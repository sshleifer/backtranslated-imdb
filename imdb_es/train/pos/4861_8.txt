Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot, what there is of it, is about a British woman (Fontaine) in love with an American, who is confused with Astaire, a musical comedian. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Stevens, contains wonderful music by Gershwin, which includes "Good work if you can get it" and "A foggy day". The best scene is the number "Stiff Upper Lip", which takes place in a fun house. <br /> <br /> The singing voice of Astaire sounds more robust in this movie than in others, and has a couple of excellent dance numbers Burns plays his best publicist and Allen is Burns' secretary. She is hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the movie. Stevens could easily have used a double because it shows the dance in a long shot, and takes place between the trees. I thought it was a double, except that the dance was so bad. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.
