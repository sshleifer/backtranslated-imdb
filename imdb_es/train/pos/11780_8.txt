This is a documentary that I found by chance on the UK television channel More4 and I must say that I found it extremely interesting and stimulating. I will also look for the book that was the source material of this documentary. Basically, this is Professor Jared Diamond's theory of why certain parts of the societies of the earth prospered and others did not. The argument he presented was new to me and he discussed how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that were capable of being domesticated is certainly convincing. As for the documentary itself, it is well filmed and well narrated, without many of the recreated scenes that ruin a modern documentary. The diamond also helps by not being condescending, which is the fault of many intellectuals when they try to convey a message to the masses. People have claimed that their theory is Marxist, but I do not buy this and I see it as a partner partner geologist. It was also comforting to hear a theory about the evolution of society that is not based on religion. Highly recommended visualization.
