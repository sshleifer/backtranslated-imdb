This is the best series of its kind I've seen all year. I can not stop thinking that it's just my luck: a series that I love has 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant flow of police cutters of cookies gets endless episodes. <br /> <br /> I think the reasons why the new tricks are successful are many. The scripts are good and the combination of characters is excellent. The acting is first class and the combination of comedy and drama works wonders. The stories are not so memorable, but that's not the reason why I watch shows like this. <br /> <br /> The theme song is one of the favorites, and we were disappointed to discover that it is not available in any published edition. Great things, BBC, a triumph of meaning over sexual attractiveness (apart from the young sheriff, there is no one there as a witness, and even if it is, he can still act!).
