Oh, the 70's. A moment when I was about to be a swinger. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger, but he felt more daring then. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a good soft-core movie. In fact, just like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a plot and a character development. <br /> <br /> It's pretty much what you'd expect from a swingers movie. Two couples with open relationships rekindle the passion for travel of the MILF of one of the women who has come to visit. Not much more. <br /> <br /> Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Welles, then it's a different story. Not too many 40-somethings look as delicious as Mrs. Welles's. Just for the price, it's worth seeing that Mrs. Welles looks at herself in the mirror as if she were Aphrodite. She is not "Stifler's mom". She is much sexier. <br /> <br /> I also dug Chris Jordan's Anna. Jordan looks and looks so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought it could be her twin "separated at birth" or even Elaine herself. Anna is always eating, but she must have an incredible metabolism. <br /> <br /> Unlike the soft core pornography of 1990, the soft porn of the 70s retained the realism of the hardcore movie (something that the soft-core of 2000 has brought on occasion, instead of the 90 canned music and orgasms) and it's here with all its might. It is not real, but it feels real. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoyed the "Deux Femmes En Or" produced in Quebec, they will enjoy this. Another classic movie only in Drive-In Classics, the best amount of $ 2.50 a month you can spend.
