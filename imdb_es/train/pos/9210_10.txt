I feel like this is one of the best movies I've seen, I'm an older man and I love most westerns. I love movies based in part, at least on facts. If I'm not mistaken, this is a movie like that. I also like rematch movies. This also qualifies in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene. I felt that the scene of the beat of the corral was a bit exaggerated, but it did not affect how I feel about the whole movie. I saw what I think is a continuation of this movie in an episode of gun smoke. I also liked it. I recommend taking the time to see this movie, I will see it again. I also felt that the romantic parts of this movie were well interpreted. I thought it was so out of the ordinary for Randy Travis to play a kind of villain, but I always enjoy his performance.
