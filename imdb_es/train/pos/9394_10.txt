"Red Rock West" was, by far, one of the best thrillers of suspense of the 90s with a magnificent script (by John and Rick Dahl) that kept you guessing and on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and featured a wonderful cast that includes Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially J. T. Walsh (in a memorable performance) making this an exciting and fascinating thriller that can not be missed. The film never got much publicity in the release (in fact, I found it for the first time on TV) and, therefore, it is one of those special little gems that you have to look for, but this unique movie is gradually gaining a worship. <Br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams, who is bankrupt and jobless when he is in the small town of Red Rock. Confused by a hit man named Lyle from Dallas, he is surprised to be offered $ 10,000 to murder the wife of bar owner Wayne Brown (the excellent J. T. Walsh). Follow the plan and decide that you should go and warn Brown's wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but then the plot gets complicated and there are so many twists, turns and surprises, and double deals, that Cage is thrown from a crisis to other. And he finds himself trapped in a terrible situation from which he can not crawl! Then, to further complicate things, the real Lyle appears to carry out the contract killing (played by everyone's favorite Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what has happened, he persecutes Cage, but no one could see the amazing events that follow. <br /> <br /> Some favorite lines of the film: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): "I hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's a lot of money". <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (to Cage): "Michael Williams, well, Michael, you're going to spend some time with us until we get to the bottom of this." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "Are not you a murderer?" Cage: "That's right, no, but the guy who is supposed to go to the city, so you have to get out of here." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "Ok, how are you? I'm going to explain how to ignore a hitman and take $ 10,000 from my husband?" <br /> <br /> An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (only 98 minutes) with a story that never ceases to be as powerful as that of all directors. Any movie with J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and "Red Rock West" was one of his best. How sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was tragically cut short by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific period for "film noir" was undoubtedly the forties, but "Red Rock West" is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my "Top Ten" list of favorite movies of all time. I hope more like this from director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
