The third film by Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard is a little more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. It is another adaptation of the Burlesque play, which apparently was popular in its time. <br /> <br /> The original Burlesque play ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances and it is the role that Carole Lombard plays that Barbara Stanwyck originated on Broadway that took her to Hollywood. A version starring Nancy Carroll in the early days of the talkies and later Betty Grable and Dan Dailey made another version in When My Baby Smiles at Me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have a vinyl album from a radio version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler did for the Radio Lux Theater. It's an interesting job, believe me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, MacMurray and Lombard are fine with the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Consider a good performance of Dorothy Lamour as the Latin slut that stands between Fred and Carole. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of his first films as a wolf in the making of Lombard. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low holds up very well today and I would not be surprised if we saw another version. Of burlesque for the 21st century.
