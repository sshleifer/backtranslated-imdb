['This movie is not great, but it&#39;s good and nice. It feels like an indie movie made from a game script. Basically, Morgan Freeman interprets himself, although the director swears that the script was not written for him. And there is the small irony of the actor who goes to a supermarket to investigate for a film that has not yet been committed. I mean, he really made the movie at the end and we&#39;re watching it :) <br /><br /> I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste, but nonetheless refreshing. This is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go. A little too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me. <br /><br /> In short: a good small movie, made in two weeks, with basically two actors and some extras, driven by dialogue, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)']
