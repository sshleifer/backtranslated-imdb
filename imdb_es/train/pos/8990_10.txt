The movie is about Anton Newcombe. The music and the races of the two bands are simply backdrop. It's just that Newcombe has the last word about the film, which at the time of writing can be found in the "news" section of the brianjonestownmassacre website. I would link it here, but IMDb will not allow it. <br /> <br /> Documentaryists are limited by what the camera captures, as well as by the need to gather a cohesive narrative of somewhat random occasions when chance has placed the camera lens in a line of sight with a relevant coincidence. In Dig !, fortune smiled on the Dandy Warhols, capturing their rise to the status of pop-idol candidates, while forming pop sweets produced for mass consumption, especially "Bohemian Like You", a song that made them the world. Thanks to a Euro cell phone ad. <br /> <br /> There was no such luck for the Brian Jonestown massacre. The film captures little of what made the original BJM lineup fantastic, with the only exception of a single montage, which lasted about a minute, showing Newcombe creating / recording a series of brief instrumental parts, unremarkable in themselves. , and concluding the sequence with a reproduction of the exuberant and brilliant sounds that had to have been in the mind and soul of Newcombe before they could enter the world. <br /> <br /> Three comments accompany the film; one by the filmmakers and two by the members of the bands (the BJM track is only former members, and without Newcombe). Both the Warhols alumni and the BJM alumni point to this montage sequence as the "best" movie fragment, and I agree that given the film's focus on Anton Newcombe, it's the only part of the film that she sheds adequate light on her gift, and it seems too brief to provide an adequate balance to this attempt at a portrait of the "tortured artist." <br /> <br /> The interesting thing about the comments is that, unlike the cinema, they are recorded in real time. - what can be more revealing than a documentary that takes shape mainly through editing. <br /> <br /> The Dandies do not go well in their comments. If the world of rock and roll extends the experience of high school life for its inhabitants, as I think they do, the Dandies are preppy types obsessed with popularity, those who listen to rock because that's what their classmates do, while The BJM team presents itself as half-rejected, half self-exiled strangers (to those who have access as the Dandies, "losers") who are the true spirit of rock. Joel Gion of BJM, who talks a lot, tells me the message of the film when he says (paraphrasing): "You can not forget that Anton has been able to do the only thing he said he wanted to do, make a lot of good music". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the Dandies laugh too easily at every scandalous display in the course of the Newcombe crisis (all the BJM images here end in 1997, before Newcombe abandons heroin). Courtney Taylor-Taylor's discount of Newcombe's commitment to his vision is summarized as follows: "He is 37 years old and still lives in his car, he can download all his work on his website." He was so tired of being scammed by all the others, is giving away everything, I could be doing a mint. " You can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief. <br /> <br /> The defects of the film can not be attributed to the filmmakers; rather, it is the difficulties of the documentary form and the loss of cooperation of the subject of the film, which makes this portrait of Newcombe so fragmentary. But it's probably the best we'll get, apart from his music. <br /> <br /> I only rented disk one, which has the function. Most of the extras are on disk two. Do not rent it, as I put in my order to buy the set.
