['Barbara Stanwyck gives this soap, directed by Douglas Sirk, produced by Universal, the kick she needs. It&#39;s not as memorable as Sirk&#39;s later melodramas, it&#39;s easy to see when he sees &quot;Everything I want&quot; to where Sirk would artistically approach in the coming years. Stanwyck is a dancer who returns with her family in a small town, EE. UU., After having abandoned it a decade before. His family and his community have mixed emotions when dealing with his shocking return. Part of the cinematography is amazing, and Stanwyck is hard as a nail and really gives this movie a shot of energy. In general, a pretty good show.']
