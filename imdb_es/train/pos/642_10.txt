I was dragged into this movie about four years ago by a French actress of mine. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour I was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, hating this movie. hating me and even hating the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened, but I got into the movie in a way that had not been in years. And this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to make each change by hand. I was in the theater about four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I think big movies drag you into a world, make you part of it and then leave you to talk to your friends about a coffee or a drink. This movie did that. It was one of the best cinematographic experiences I've had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
