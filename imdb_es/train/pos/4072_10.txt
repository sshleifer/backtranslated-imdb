The name of Hayao Miyazaki became prominent in Spitied Away, however, what is often overlooked are the first efforts of the film director. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this movie, almost certainly the last 45 minutes at the end of the 80s and what remained with me was the visual exuberance of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known store for Â£ 9 I could not resist buying it. The strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the film do not match my memory (memory is fun that way). <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie now with all the knowledge gained from the portfolios of artists is how very much like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud, some of the illustrations are. I can only assume some influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a girl who is falling (Sheeta), his adventure really begins: the search for Laputa, a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked part in Gulliver's Travels. With healthy references to Jules Verne, it's a basic movie of good versus bad persecution. The final part has heroes that end in Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the strongest part of my memory: the "pastoral" The ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature: the multitude of robots covered in moss under the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the film: the views of the surface of Laputa, unlike the underground machining. <br /> <br /> Although this is the dichotomy of this film, to show that even technology can not overcome nature: the irony of the last robot that takes care of the garden and the animals. The end of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly elegant, I would not say 'polished': very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, aircraft and the design and appearance of almost everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this type of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it.
