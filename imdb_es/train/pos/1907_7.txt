8 Simple Rules is a fun program, but it also has some life lessons, especially a mature lesson on how to move forward after a loss, which was the episode in which Paul died, the first episode I have seen of the show that is presented on ABC. The Hennessy Clan - mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and their son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - search each other for guidance and support after Paul's death (John Ritter), the patriarch of the family. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) lend a hand. I'm glad later, in the second season of this program, they decided to include David Spade in this show, since it ended with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But everything and everything this show is quite good. This program reminds me a lot of the classic family comedies of the 80s and 90s that used to be on ABC.
