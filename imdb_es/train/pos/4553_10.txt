As far as I know, the real boy with whom the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an exceptional portrait, I agree with him. This is a fantastic movie about a very talented child with a special part of the body that helps him. Daniel Day-Lewis, BAFTA and Oscar winner, and Golden Globe nominee, plays Christy Browna, a crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carried by his family. Although he has a special left foot, he can write with him, paint with him and hold things with him. Learn to talk later in the movie, it's very good for a guy like him. Also starring the Oscar winner of Home Alone 2, and the Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA earning Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. He was nominated for the Oscar for Best Director by Jim Sheridan, Best Screenplay, Screenplay based on material from another medium and Best Film, was nominated for the BAFTA for Best Film, Best Makeup Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 in The 100 best movie stars, was number 20 in The 50 best British actors, was number 9 in the best actors in Britain, and number 15 in the world's greatest actor , and the movie was number 28 in The 50 Best British Films. Exceptional!
