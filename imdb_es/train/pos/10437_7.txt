This is a story of slow movement. There is no action. There is no crazy suspense. There are no abrupt surprises. If you can not stand watching a movie about two people who just talk and walk, about a story that slowly develops to the end and about the romance of love, do not waste time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you like dialogue, the master narrative of the stories, the ideas that make you reflect and the search for true love in the plot of life, this is your movie. However, I recommend that you watch this movie when you are more alert, because the rhythm, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a meeting environment. It is really fantastic. I really want to say that. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are sometimes annoying with their manners, but, fortunately, the chemistry between the two makes the performance very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel from the beginning, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In your conversations there are excellent comments on many topics that will provoke thoughts and conversations between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters, but it could be underestimating their intelligence. Still, it did not ruin the movie. <br /> <br /> The general story is very simple, I think it gives the film its charm and, ultimately, its power. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: The flow of the film is slow. The dialogue is fascinating. History is constructed in a smooth, systematic and substantive way. The development to the end is satisfying and, in the end, rewarding.
