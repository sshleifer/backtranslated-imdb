Although the version of Lang is more famous, the work of Borzage is not devoid of interest, far from it: his sequences "celestial" are even better. The metaphor of the train (perhaps taken from the end of Abel Gance's "la roue") is eventually more convincing than the celestial world "above." <br /> <br /> Borzage's tenderness for its characters is shown in Marie's character and love beyond the grave is one of her favorite themes (the ending of "three comrades"). Fun The park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we are in Marie's poor house. I do not think the sets are so corny, they're stylized at all. The fair from afar almost gives a sense of science fiction for The movie. <br /> <br /> Borzage never forgets his social concerns: in the celestial train that goes up, the Rich can not be confused with the scam, but as the "chief magistrate" says: "there is no difference here". <br /> <br /> It's not an important job for Borzage (neither is Lang's version), but to find out if you're interested in the great director's career.
