The best action movie of Sly. It's a very nice movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and the direction of Renny Harlins is assured with style. Stallone is rarely that interesting in his action movies and he certainly looks very good in terms of action scenes. This was one of the best action movies of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable of the 90s, a classic of the definitive genre. As a Stallone fan, this is one that I remember with good memories. A lot of excellent action and Sly in the form of main action man. Action lovers appreciate this movie because it has all the hallmarks that make a good action movie. The film looks great and there is a lot of support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
