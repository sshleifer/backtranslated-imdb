This movie is so cool. It is likely that in the 40s and the character of Meg Ryan fight to be known as "smart". Also, Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And everything has a magical feeling towards him. Every time I see him, I feel happy. It's definitely a girl movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I also love music. The violin is impressive. But besides that, I think it's a beautiful story and everyone should see it.
