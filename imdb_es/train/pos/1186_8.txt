There has been a lot of talk about "psychological Westerners," but this is one of the few that really is in that genre. He has recognized stars who perform very well, but it is the director who makes this a good movie. Stewart Granger loses his stereotype of British safari hunter to play a emaciated retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays the upstart (in contrast to the usual young upstart, the character of Taylor is also middle-aged), who wants to kill buffalo, and takes Granger to do business with him. They hire two other well-known actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, to become their flayers. Granger is obsessed with the buffalo he has killed, knowing that he may be guilty if they become extinct, knowing that if they are extinguished, the Native American way of life will suffer greatly. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic saying, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of modern cinema, created by nerds and dorks. It is insecure and needs human company. Still, it will not stop at the murder. The final faces the two against each other, with a surprising conclusion. The psychological effects of what they are doing are well described.
