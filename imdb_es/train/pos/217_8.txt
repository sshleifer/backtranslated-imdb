THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious adaptation for the 1975 screen of Neil Simon's work on a retired Vaudevillian team, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter separation and have been asked to meet once again to a television special or something like that. . The problem is that the two still hate each other and do not want to have anything to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as the nephew of Matthau, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this meeting a reality. This warm and winning comedy is an adorable lover of a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and works mainly thanks to one of the best screenplays by Neil Simon and the outstanding work of Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for this, but I think Matthau moves away with this film with his impeccable performance as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor, but he had no chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST; However, in another year, this was a performance worthy of an Oscar. Matthau controls the screen and there is no false note in this beautifully timed performance. The scene where you are auditioning for a commercial of French fries and can not get the correct name of the product is a classic. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning comedy by Neil Simon that shines thanks to an unmatched chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
