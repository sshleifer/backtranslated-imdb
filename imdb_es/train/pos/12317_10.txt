['A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is something negative to say about A Chinese Ghost Story, it could be that special effects seem outdated compared to modern technology. The movie has a simple premise: a poor debt collector has to stay in an isolated area while trying to collect a debt. Of course, it happens that she is also delighted. <br /><br /> What I did not expect the first time I saw this movie is that it is one of the most moving love stories I have seen; That is, without losing any of the slapstick comedies that will make you lose points. Unlike some Asian movies, A Chinese Ghost Story is not hard to swallow for those who are not versed in Chinese culture. In fact, it reproduces itself in timeless themes and without a culture of the paranormal and romance. <br /><br /> Think Evil Dead 2, if they had released a wonderful love story in the mix. This movie is real, despite being ignored by many. It is absolutely one of the best I have seen. His ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross cultural boundaries to attract humanity everywhere is nothing less than fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.']
