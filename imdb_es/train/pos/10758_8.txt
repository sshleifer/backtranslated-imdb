September 11 is a classic example of real cinema, a kind of realistic documentary, in this case of New York firefighters as they fight against one of the most extraordinary events in world history. They are handheld video cameras, small and discreet, often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming (and by the director, the hand of Naudet who cleans the screen frequently). <br /> <br /> In this film, meet most of the firefighters: Tony Benatatos, the rookie (or "probie", in the vernacular of the New York Firefighter), Fire Chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who discovers that he later lost his brother) and some others. There are study interviews with most of these people throughout the film, just to emphasize the personal and reflective nature of the events. The preparation is quite dramatic and well done, in particular the exit ceremony at the Fire Department, with some useful swish sans and a kind of dialectical editing of the film quite limited (like Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men). Tony looks proud. <br /> <br /> The point of view and angle of the camera are usually from the fire department, which is interesting and there are some excellent images inside the lobby of WTC1, while Pfeiffer and his team plan what to do continuation. This is the true classic cinema. There is also the strange and disturbing sound of the occasional human body that crashes against the porch outside. That is when a Fire Chief, Pfeiffer, increasingly sad, realizes that his task is desperate and probably hopeless, and this is before WTC2 collapses. You have to recognize Naudet for knowing which faces to film and at what time. <br /> <br /> The sound of the collapse of the neighbor WTC2 is so sad, moving and terrifying that you realize how difficult this is. firefighters. From the lobby, it looks, feels and sounds like the end of the world, and the poor firemen are so bewildered and frightened. You hear a huge trembling vortex, like that of a gigantic monolithic beast that slowly falls to the ground after being mortally wounded. The neighboring tower has collapsed, but the fire department remaining in WTC1 is oblivious to this event. Where is the communication? <br /> <br /> This film is captivating, however, the narrative is amateurish and should have been avoided: signs like "this really was a day like no other" or Naudet's frequent banal statements like "you could see "Fear in everyone's eyes and 'I knew Tony was going crazy'! The movie is actually a long video diary. There are no pictures from above in the building where some of the firefighters have gone. Imagine that this movie is mixed with the CCTV images of some of the highest rooms or some of the news of the day. The effect would be greater. You could even combine this story with that of Mayor Giuliani and, perhaps, the famous man from the cornice Rick Riscorla, who literally was many floors acting as the hero. <br /> <br /> I do not see much of an element of propaganda in this film, as some critics suggest. This film is not a triumph of the will, of Riefenstahl. Some time later, firefighters cover the American flag on a nearby building that survives and that dominates what has become Ground Zero. So what? <br /> <br /> There are also some moments of dubious work with the camera; For example, who holds the camera when the two Naudet brothers meet at the fire station? Is he on stage? <br /> <br /> There is an excellent finish, very in the tradition of the excellent French director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima mon amour), with two strips of light reflected in the water, which shine.
