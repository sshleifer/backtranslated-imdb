After all the garbage that Hollywood (and the Indies) have produced, we finally got a movie that offers some moments of fear. There are some clich√© moments, but I'm not sure that nowadays it's possible to make a completely original movie. There's not much news here ... it's just done well. <br /> <br /> Be sure and pay attention, since "subtle" fears come quickly and frequently. This is not a movie to watch while you eat pizza. <br /> <br /> In this film there is a well-written false clue and, unfortunately, a very misunderstood function. Cheri Christian simply does not make Julie (the wife / mother) effective. On the one hand, she is totally unfriendly. I know, I know ... she just went through a traumatic experience. But the viewer never gets to know her as "normally" is and the relationship between her and her husband is quite uncomfortable (in an unintentional way). I think the director had wanted us to feel some sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a thumbs up for the end, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It could easily have become cheaper with a sound effect at the beginning of the final credits, but the director resisted wisely. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece in any way, but it's a good old fashioned one. Scary movie ... something that is quite rare nowadays.
