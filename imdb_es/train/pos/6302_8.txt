I went to see this as My Lady and I had little else to do on a Sunday afternoon. I like movies that deal with bad characters and losers, and this is full of them. After a slow start, we get some good turns from the cast, but it's the real 'Bellini' who makes and leaves the movie. The 'Bellini' is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie for a long time, but it's too short and could have made this a global masterpiece 71/2 out of 10
