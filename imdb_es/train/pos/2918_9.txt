... I saw him on cable in the late 1980s, since he was a huge fight fan since 1986. I saw him on VHS in a "sale" container and I bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, I started training as a fighter after the Air Force and I would always see this again to see what a very accurate portrait of the people involved in the fight was like (families and friends who do not they would understand us, the trip, the anguish, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and, at times, sad to see, since no one else can understand which genius is creative. A great way to separate Fonz's character who played in Happy Days at that time. Also, look at the cast ... William Daniels (Knight's Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice), and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you have a chance, look at it.
