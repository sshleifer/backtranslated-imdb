This film seems to draw a limit: on the one hand, those who love it, on the other, those who find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> For starters, there is a lot of comedy in this movie that many viewers are not "getting". Of course, Jet Li's Mask looks like Bruce Lee's Kato. It's supposed to be a joke. The guy who has a time bomb sewn into his heart ... outrageous? Of course, it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask, if this movie is supposed to be so funny, why all the excessive and bloody violence? Well, in the first place, tolerance to this level of violence is really different, from culture to culture; and although the Hong Kong public would recognize that this violence is extreme, it is certainly only slightly more than the average for a Hong Kong action film. <br /> <br /> In addition, Black Mask is really the kind of film that takes the conventions and thrusts of a genre. Extremely, simply because the conventions themselves are totally unreal. After decades of watching people shoot without notable open wounds, many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde and the outlaws of the Wild Bunch spilling blood everywhere. But the fact is that when you are shot with a rapid metal projectile, it is almost certain that blood will flow, especially from an artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese comic book movie. It's true that Spiderman movies never get so bloody, but if they were true to reality, they would be! Well, despite its comic origins, this film is true to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is the dazzling and stylized filming and editing. If the creators of this film had filmed it with an eye to nostalgia for the Hollywood style (like, for example, The Rocketeer, or Sky's recent captain's film), I doubt anyone has considered it offensive. <br /> <br /> But as it is, I still had a lot of fun watching this movie.
