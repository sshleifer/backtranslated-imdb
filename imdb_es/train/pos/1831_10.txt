['This movie was pretty horrible. The last Vipul Shah movie was good. This was bad, although it is a good story and it is handled in an excellent way. Aatish Kapadia, who adapted this film from another Gujarati work &quot;Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu&quot;, made a good but slow pianful. 2 hours and a half to see there are many faults in this movie, but still it is an entertaining song and it does not work well, but it is still good in general, not a movie that you would see with enthusiasm, it is still a story. Take it into account and it&#39;s good if you&#39;re the kind of pretty good movie relationship with a lot of flaws and humor that really is not necessary even a little']
