This movie is cold, pure truth. We often think "oh no, that will not happen to me". But can. Drug smuggling is a large sum of money and, often, people, without knowing it (or cheated), do things for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them, they just wanted an exotic vacation, which turned into a nightmare. People need to know that these types of events are not improbable or exaggerated: this is a major problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the necessary understanding to really appreciate this. movie. It is very emotional and raw. It's worth seeing and it definitely stays in your memory.
