The advances of this film can show scenes of violence or unconventional sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, selected to attract the audience. Of course, they are showing the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> People who are kicked in the head in their jobs and lives, using the power they can have elsewhere, to oppress notoriously to others. And at the lower end of the chain of oppression, mostly women. <br /> <br /> A movie that shows this as brutally as Hundstage is surely difficult to face, but having to endure such lives is even more difficult. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is very similar to Short Cuts, but it consists of episodes of documentary style, with people like your neighbor, playing as they are. Without any brightness, and most disturbing, without any hope. His documentary style makes the film even more disturbing, because he realizes that these people are out there, and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the beautiful exterior aspects. Somewhere, the porn industry has to do its business, someplace unrecognized domestic violence has to happen, somewhere hope has to be broken. I sure know those people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie without funny scenes (some may think that the disabled woman who repeats the ten most important supermarkets is fun, but this really happens) and without any Melodramatic, go see this movie . However, it will be lost when you focus on the subtitles, I'm afraid, since the subtitles can not convey the accentuation.
