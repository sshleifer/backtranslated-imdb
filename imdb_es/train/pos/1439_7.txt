CITY HALL is a mixed bag. Part vignettes of the political life of New York, and part moralizing tale. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-style boss with presidential dreams, often has a grim or subdued performance. There are a couple of times when you chew the stage, and in the case of CITY HALL, this is where it shines. John Cusack offers a tenuous and generally impeccable performance, without entering into the caricature of a New Orleans dialect, or slipping into melodrama during the climax of the film. Danny Aiello as Burrough's political boss, is also very good. I also love melodies. <br /> <br /> The main problem with CITY HALL, and it's a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of lack of momentum. It is more like a documentary than a movie. We see the action or follow the story from an independent perspective and, naturally, the viewer does not get involved. When the viewer is not involved to a certain extent, he becomes apathetic with the characters and, finally, with the plot. <br /> <br /> This tends to alienate, and what should have been a fascinating and informative detail. , it came out like a "Hmmm ... uh ... it's okay". They say that you can not fight against the town hall, as the worn cliche says. However, he still can not help thinking about what could have been, if they had limited the script and the rhythm of this film.
