This Showtime movie really deserves a viewer rating much better than a 4.5; I gave him a 10 based on the history and performance of the two stars. After reading the comments of the viewer, I was surprised how many people expected this film to be a comedy. Yes, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy / Drama under Genre. That sure is deceptive, is not it? Fortunately, I watched the movie before logging into this website, so I did not have that expectation. In fact, based on the synopsis of what I heard, I hoped it was simply a drama. I wonder if the disappointment at not being a funny movie caused so many low votes. <br /> <br /> Another factor that could have caused low votes is that this movie is very "driven by the characters". "Driving Miss Daisy" is an example of another movie based on characters that comes to mind. The previous comment of someone complained about a boring trial. The work scenes of Tom (Danny Glover) seemed to distract the real plot of the film. That is, how he was designing the ascending social ascension of his family, or his personal troops, if he so wishes. However, they served to establish credibility and justification as their right to move to Greenwich and ascend the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession turned into a compulsion. He showed that he would stop at nothing to mix with the white neighborhood. His displeasure when another black person moved next to him was not due to the color of his skin. It was because of everything that the "intruder" represented; Everything Tom had left behind. In essence, Tom had become an Oreo cookie: black on the outside but white on the inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this film are among the most powerfully written, directed and performed (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have had the pleasure of witnessing. I realized that the climax of the movie was not the obvious event that happened next door (I do not want to give it away). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I'm still not clear if it's the conversation when he informs Tom which university Tom-Dos is going to go to or when he publishes it, all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. However, the outcome is great. You know that life on that street will never be the same again. <br /> <br /> My favorite type of movie driven by the character: people go through problems, some pain, dance, grow, change, and live. happens. As a member of the audience, I can learn something or be inspired.
