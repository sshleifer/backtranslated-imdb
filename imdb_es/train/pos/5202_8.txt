I just saw this version of "Samhain" and, although I still like it, it has nothing to do with the "raw" version that I have. If you check the message board, you will see an apology from the director for this reduced version, 79 minutes, and says that it had nothing to do with this cropped edition of R-rating with a completely new ending. Cristiano does not really need to be very self-aware, because the basic elements of blood still stand up, although very clipped. This is a shame, because it had the potential to be one of the bloodiest and best movies of all the years. He still has the porn stars, and the inbreds, and some of the extreme gore can be seen at least partially. I'm just glad to have that "rough cut", because for me it's a gem for any gorehounds library. Christian Viel definitely has the ability and vision to deliver the goods, and we hope that his next project will be better produced. The idiots had a classic almost in their hands and ruined it for everyone. "Samhain" may be one of the most controversial and badly managed horror films in history, and the gorehounds could not see what the director intended. <br /> <br /> *********** ****************************** *** Just so you know what you missed, this is my criticism based on the "work impression" of SAMHAIN. <br /> <br /> The film lasts just over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops. There is absolutely no music soundtrack, and some of the scenes have no audio in the dialog box, because I think they are meant to be played later. However, most of the movie has audio with sound effects, and when an effect or a scene is missing, a message appears as an insertion signal when the movie is completed. It's exactly what it says, a "Hard Cut", BUT the only uncut version of "Samhain" that you're likely to see. Reason, because the gore is extremely graphic, much more than even an NC-17 would allow. Yes, there are some porn stars, but they are there to kill, and to add a bit of sugar and spices. The story is quite common, American tourists who are on vacation in Ireland and end up staying in a house in the middle of the forest. An area that is loaded with folklore, which involves the ancient druids and the celebration of Samhain, or as we call it Halloween. (Spooky) <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a GREAT dose of blood, as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local blood mutants. This is a big bloody scene, when the boy finds his girl hanging from a cliff, with her cry for help. All he sees is the head, arms and shoulders that hang in front of him and when he lifts it, it has been cut completely in two. This is what I would call GORE EXTREME, with bowels, blood and limbs cut all over the place. We are in the territory of Herschell Gordon Lewis, friends, except that the effects seem much more realistic. I'm going to skip the story, because it's your standard plan to stalk and kill. <br /> <br /> The next gore scene is something to behold, since the boyfriend of the first murder is taken to a cave as a place. (TCM-2), and linked to a table. This geek then cuts off all his limbs (outside the camera, with an indication to insert a scene), and then we see his torso in a barbecue pit, slowly turning over the fire, and the torso has an erection (if you can believe it that). Yes, in very bad taste, disgusting, frightening, find the right word, and probably fit too. <br /> <br /> Then, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything, is cut from the neck to the crotch, and all her insides are removed with graphic joy, and her blood drains into a pot. Yummy, a real turn, huh? <br /> <br /> But the best gore scene happens inside the house, and I must admit that this is one of the best gore scenes I've seen. This guy (no matter who) gets trapped behind a geek and opens up in the ass hole. Then, the geek puts his hands and pulls all the entrails, intestines and what the hell is in the ass. This continues FOREVER, while the man screams and more and more entrails are removed all over the floor of the bathroom. This is so extreme, so exaggerated, that I found myself laughing at hell. Obviously, you will NEVER NEVER see this scene on a suitable DVD, IMO, along with most other really extreme gore scenes. <br /> <br /> So, what to think about all this. Well, first of all, although I doubt that this movie will be released in this presentation without cuts, it makes this "Rough Cut" a rare gem for gorehounds. Yes, it's a bit difficult at first, with no soundtrack, there are still some scenes to insert and credits that have missing names everywhere. But that's what makes this so unique, and I would not trade it for anything at this time. Extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme gore. This makes "Haute Tension" look like a Disney movie.
