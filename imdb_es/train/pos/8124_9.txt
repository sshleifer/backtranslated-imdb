Apart from the great movie METROPOLIS, it is the oldest pure science fiction movie. While sometimes the movie is a bit preached and the acting can be a bit wide, it's a great movie for two reasons. First, it is extremely original in both style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no movies you can think of as similar. Secondly, at the time, the special effects were absolutely incredible: use matte paintings, models and huge molds to create amazing scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a great city of tomorrow. Sure, you could sit down and hit the movie because, by today's standards, the effects are more or less like that. However, you should appreciate that this was the state of the art when the film premiered in 1936 and must have surprised the public. In many ways, the scenarios seem very reminiscent of the "modern cities" presented in the WORLD FAIR OF 1939. <br /> <br /> I think the film is also interesting because it seems torn by the question "are people really So stupid? Or are we destined for greatness? The final result seems to be a bit of both! What a truth! <br /> <br /> A final note: I saw it twice on TV and not long ago in the The three times the sound and print quality reeked, particularly the sound.If it is available on a DVD, it is expected to be much cleaner and to provide optional closed captioning.As the sound of the video was cut, it really I would have appreciated this!
