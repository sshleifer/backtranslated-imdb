One of my favorite movies to date begins as an adventure through the wild side of a four-man Atlanta team. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse River before it becomes a lake comes from Lewis, Burt Reynold, who unconsciously drowns his companions in their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film appears as an action movie, the second part takes the viewer to a totally different story, with our men forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the film, each person will be forced to deal with the scars of what was a weekend on the river, but will be silenced in a struggle to survive. The film (except for some pretty obvious errors) is very well directed and beautifully shot in a paradise of nature that takes your breath away. Photography is excellent too. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are excellent at showing how a single event can ruin different lives linked to the same error in different ways.
