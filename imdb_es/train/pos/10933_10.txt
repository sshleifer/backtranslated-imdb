Be careful with this one. Once you have your gloves, it will change the way you see kung fu movies. It will crave a plot of all the kung fu movies now, will want depth and development of the characters, will crave mystery and unpredictability, will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backgrounds. Unfortunately, you will not find all these aspects together in a kung fu movie, EXCEPT for Five Deadly Venoms! <br /> <br /> Easily the best kung fu movie of all time, Venoms combines a rich plot, full of twists and turns, with colorful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best camera work of the 70s. The success of someone who likes the movie depends on the ability of the viewer to decipher which character is which and who specializes in what poison. One is the Centipede, two is the Serpent, three is the Scorpion, four is the Lizard and five is the Toad. Each character has different characteristics, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. There is the hook, we learn together with the character of the student, discovering who becomes these different men. We are in their place (so to speak), and we have to choose who we trust and who does not, just as he does. We learn together with him. <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot, the characters and the work of the camera great, it's also fun to watch, which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of its kind. It is worth enough watches to discover everything that is happening. Venoms is a lesson about what kung fu really can do ... but do not expect many other kung fu movies to be up to the task.
