['Through the great division we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about what was explained by the ancient tribal elders. In each case, there is a lot about the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us not to prepare for what they notice is the &quot;end of time&quot;. In this film called &quot;The Last Wave&quot;, an aboriginal native is killed for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent, less disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays defense attorney assigned to defend the defendant. Although persecuted by prophetic images of his own childhood and warned by the modern signs that an Aboriginal sympathizer named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil) gave him, Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and, therefore, is not subject to justice standard. The film is full of disconcerting and obscure images of the disasters of the apocalyptic end world and warns of a future tsunami and destruction of the island. The black drama and deep rituals are what give this film a frightening charm and, therefore, it is not for the faint of heart, in fact, the simplest apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of the innocent bystanders. Good silent drama. ****']
