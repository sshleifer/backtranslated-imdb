While I have great respect for Disney animated films, in recent times they have not been what I would call a "must visit". Atlantis was intrigued by the first poster and the last trailer of the film, and fortunately it lived up to my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a more "mature" Disney movie in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual feature for a Disney movie indeed), and focuses more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offer. The world of Atlantis, hidden under the core of the earth, is fantastic, it presents itself as desolate caves with ruins, and then slowly develops into real ecosystems, which, although they usually contain some memory of the hardness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached. The presentation of the landscape and the environment of Atlantis, without a happy and disposable song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it with the mythology of ancient civilizations in real life adds to this, and it works quite well. <br /> <br /> Also, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole's Practical Jokes, there did not seem to be much of a "childish" element that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to reach Atlantis and the constant discovery that took place at Atlantis, since Milo, the stranger, was able to learn everything he needed to know about the place, helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own story they did not know about Part of this involves the Atlantean "armament", which is used in a very action-packed climax that is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Of course, not the whole story is complete. It makes sense, and the film does not present any new computer-generated visual effects, but, apart from the Toy Story films, this is the most entertaining Disney movie I've seen in years.
