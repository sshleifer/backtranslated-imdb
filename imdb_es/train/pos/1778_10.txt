I just want to say that I am very happy that someone has finally spilled the beans in this movie. Bravo "El Spaz", Bravo! This movie is a ridiculous farce from the cinema. Especially for a student movie! I just want to give Spazz credit for taking the absurd amount of time to find such a weird image, and then COMMENT! Most people I know do not have that kind of time, especially because very few will finish reading it. Congratulations to you sir! Anyway, the movie follows a thin plot that is at least amazing and simply silly. I understand the idea behind the creation of a satire of Charlie's Angels, but why hire such atrocious actresses! Also, what type of director has to act, write, produce and also edit the image! Choose a job and put all your love into it, man! It's a shame because I heard he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spazz for dropping the curtain on this movie, people like you are a rare find.
