When Alan Rudolph's "Breakfast of Champions" slips into the theaters with little fanfare and much mockery, it reminds me of 1996 when Keith Gordon's "Mother's Night" came out. Now, despite all that is said about Kurt Vonnegut being "impossible to filter", it is surprising that he has received two excellent film treatments (the other one is "Slaughter-house Five"). "Mother Night" is undoubtedly one of the least appreciated films of the decade and I can not understand why. It is brilliant! He remains almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (without being too forced or too literary) and adds a poetry that is purely cinematographic. How many film adaptations of the work of any author can affirm that? Vonnegut himself even makes an appearance towards the end of the film, and can he ask for a better endorsement than that? It's not just a beautiful movie, it's a beautifully performed, written and directed film, and it's one of my selections for the five most important American films of the nineties. It is a surrealist masterpiece, inspired and sad that does not deserve to be neglected. I would sincerely encourage anyone to watch "Mother's Night," since you do not need to get acquainted with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as he sometimes does "Slaughter-house Five"). It is a powerful piece, which affects the cinema.
