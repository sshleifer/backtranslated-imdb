In short, this movie is terrifying. <br /> <br /> It starts off simply, it looks like a study of a young rebel and it becomes a beautifully designed horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not wait for gore, or zombies. This is psychological, and just as he would in Candyman, Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you realize what is happening and how the two worlds are interconnected in this movie. <br /> <br /> The drawings have never been more terrifying.
