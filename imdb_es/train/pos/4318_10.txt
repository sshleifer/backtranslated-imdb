One measure of the greatness of a movie is "if it appeared on television." At this time, would you like to sit there and watch it again? My answer to the Grand Canyon is as "powerful" as it would be for almost any movie I've seen, there are so many powerful moments, such a clever and moving story, such incredible performances. <br /> <br /> It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early 1990s, but it also dramatically affirms the ability of individuals to love, think and care In a way, the film was of its time, partly portraying society as a balloon about to explode, because the country was in a recession, and So without the leadership, this was true at the time, but the film is also timeless, I think I could honestly take on any film that has been made, and it is the most overlooked film of all time.
