This movie is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (Tim Burton's movie). But it is a less glamorous story and more in you. And, of course, here is not the father, but his grandfather is the one who tells the stories. <br /> <br /> The narrative of the film also moves back and forth (therefore, the summary of the story here in IMDb, could tell you more than you would like to read, before watching the movie ). It's funny and attractive enough, although you go from one story to another and you also have some dramatic moments. It also surprises you here and there, with things you would not expect. A good movie then, that deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like that! : o)
