I arrived late to this program, I think it was the third episode and the last episode, when I saw it for the first time, and I was amazed by a social comment that has not been seen on American television since "All in the Family". <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that CBS even executed this in the first place. <br /> <br /> Which is simply to say that the last time CBS "had a game", if you know what I mean, I was back on The Day of 'Everyone in the Family'. The most controversial decision they are willing to address today is the amount of eye makeup that is put to Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a lot of people really, really angry, let them discover the truth about themselves. And if you want them to be willing to play strings, make calls and have a work of art removed, let them discover that truth by listening to their own words uttered by their own mouths. <br /> <br /> The people of Aardman have always done it. been well ahead of the curve. And this show is not different. Somehow, he slipped under CBS's "corporate / social / political / censorship radar" to put it on the show (maybe the "great speaker" never really saw it until it finally aired?), But a Once "good" to the middle "merika listened and saw themselves being themselves, well, you can bet on the farm that the message, or the messenger, will not last long. <br /> <br /> Now, if only the 'missing episodes' can find their way to Usenet or bittorrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thanks BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
