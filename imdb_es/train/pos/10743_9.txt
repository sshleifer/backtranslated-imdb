I have read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that September 11 is a piece of amazing history. There are some who think that the aggregate narrative is weak and <br /> <br /> I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. Around two brothers who meet after the disaster and the perch on Tony. But I do not think the narration is unnecessary. Like many theorists, I believe that our own lives are narratives. We are living and doing our own autobiography. So, if we talk about our lives, this is always in the form of a narrative. We do not summarize facts like: Birth, childhood, secondary, etc. We create a story about our life. <br /> <br /> As we are familiar with the stories, we also want to include the story in a story. . Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. We can better understand the things that happened in history when they are told in the form of history. That is the purpose of adding a story in a documentary. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what is happening. If it were me, I would be worried about my brother. <br /> <br /> And the second point, making a very successful movie about it. It is true that it has been recent to present a great movie about September 11th. However, there have been some on the subject, but none of them like this documentary. But what if there will be a movie in about 5 years? I agree that it is wrong to try to earn a lot of money from 9/11. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell the story. How many movies about World War 2 have we seen? If I had not seen these movies, my vision of the WW would make me totally different. I remember seeing the Schindlers list and I cried for an hour during class. The films give you a good image of the things that happened in the story and, although it is fiction, it contributes to the memory of disasters and victims. <br /> <br /> So my point: telling stories is not always bad, it makes us identify with the story and makes us forget what happened.
