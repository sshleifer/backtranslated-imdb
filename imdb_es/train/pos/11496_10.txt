I love this movie too. I saw it when it was first shown in Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was full of people and it was a very ambitious environment. The erotic nature of the film hit the audience and the discussion with Moritz Boerner, the producer and director, was always underlined by that. In its genre, it was a very ambitious film, even especially when you think it was an independent film. <br /> <br /> There are not many copies of that movie, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and made two or more three more short films also worked for television before he became a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> For people who want to see that movie again, you can find it on your homepage, which is not so easy to find but it is possible.
