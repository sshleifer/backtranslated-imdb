"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it is very fun and accessible for many audiences. The original film could have been wonderful, with Dick Van Dyke reprising his Broadway role, but instead, they made small adjustments to the plot, so the film is very unsatisfactory. This new version, which aired on ABC in 1995, is much more faithful to the original script, and also includes some original songs that were used in a national tour from which this movie came out, starring Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (who choreographed this movie.) <br /> <br /> Jason Alexander is a very different guy from Dick Van Dyke, but he is a cast of Albert (before his time in "Seinfeld", he started in musical theater). Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. It's also a great work by Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (a role he played on the national tour). <br /> <br /> This movie is not without problems. A big responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, attractive as she is, simply looks and looks too old to be the teenager Kim. And George Wendt is a bit dull as his father, throws a little the number of "children" (an original member of the cast with which Paul Lynde stole the show). Well made film that the material deserved.
