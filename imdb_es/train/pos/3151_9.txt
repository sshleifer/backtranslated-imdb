I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was the funny prey! The first time I saw him, I was playing on ETV (Estonian Television) and I started to like it. Too bad that show is in bad time for me. Hyde is like a great guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes in stupid ideas. He got these glasses that are brown. I like it . And there is FeZ. The perverted group. We all know what he does when he is alone ... He wants them to spoil him. He even had it with his boss in one episode. It's from India. And there's Michael, the most stupid guy in the whole group, probably the most stupid guy in town and he's a cop! He is so stupid that I remember he continues: Hyde says: Did you call the police? - Michael does not come in and he says. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He is a playboy from the city. Then comes Jackie, who is Michael's ex-girlfriend and then Hyde's girlfriend. Then there's Eric Who, the son of the grumpy war veteran and son of Kitty, the housewife. Her only big pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend with whom they plan for their marriage. Donna is a hot girl. Hmm, I forgot? ah Hyde lives in a basement.
