Scanners II: The New Order is as good as David Cronenberg's classic Scanners, Scanners were made in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991, making it an eleven-year difference between the two films. The film captures the style of the scanners, which is good, it would not be the scanners without a head bang, so the II scanners have a head explosion scene that is as frightening as the first. Scanners II: The New Order has some other imaginative bloody scenes that are done well. The plot of Scanners II: The New Order is a new version of the series, since it uses the Scanners as a surveillance force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young Scanner named David Kellum discovers that it is being used and Decide Revenge <br /> <br /> Scanners II: The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's classic science fiction Scanners and should be seen. Watch this. 10/10
