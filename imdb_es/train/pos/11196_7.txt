'One-Round' Jack Sander is named after him because he is a carnival boxer who fights against any man in the audience. If they can last a round, they win a prize, a popular way to attract customers to itinerant programs a long time ago. Jack is in love with the ticket girl, Mabel, although her head turns quickly when Bob Corby enters the ring to test his chances with Jack. What nobody in the fight knows is that Bob is the champion, so he is able to beat Jack, although it takes some work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his training partner and resign from the carnival circuit. Later, Jack improves so much that he also becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly, he continues to advance in the ranking until he is almost ready to face the Champion. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the Champion and Mabel begin to run behind Jack's back, even though Mabel has now married. Jack. Then, when the final fight takes place between Jack and Bob, it is very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is it good enough? Will the justifiable anger against Bob help or hinder his performance? Tune in and see. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and although today this type of film seems strange to a director known for suspense and mystery films, in the 1920s, Hitchcock did not have a fixed genre Who Directed or wrote (did both for this movie). In fact, in many ways, this film is more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style, since a similar plot appeared in one of his next silences, THE MANXMAN (also starring Carl Brisson as the abused husband). So, although this looks a lot like a standard boxing movie of the time, it was not a radical change for this great director, even with a more well formulated ending. <br /> <br /> In general, although a little predictable and having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champion seems silly, the film works well. Although it is far from perfect silence, it is worth seeing and has a good blow.
