Man, if someone was expecting a big zombie movie after reading that title, then you're a delay and you deserve to be disappointed. As far as I'm concerned, I was expecting a low budget cheeseball zombie movie, and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a great little movie. The zombies were exactly as they should be, because all the zombies had been converted ONLY, so they are just zombies living undead. Obviously, they did it because it would have been quite expensive if they had made the rotten zombie effects. I understood the whole thing, I have no idea how anyone could really be a fighter in this movie. It's called "FIELD OF LIVING DEATH" for the love of God! Would he see "Redneck Zombies" and ANY Uwe Boll movie and, really, would I HOPE it was great? Of course, no! So, why in this movie are some imbeciles complaining like schoolgirls about this movie? I will never understand. Oh, and yes, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying that this is the worst you've seen, because you know you're full of that! Did you ever see "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "house of the dead" ???? These are some of the worst I've seen. If you can not see that it's just a low budget zombie movie obviously made by zombie movie fans, then something is wrong with you. I just had fun with that. Thumb up above me and I would also like to see a sequel.
