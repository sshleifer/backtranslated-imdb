I saw this movie every time I had the opportunity, in the seventies when it came out on cable. It was my introduction to Harlem, which has fascinated me (and Bill Clinton) ever since. I was still very young, and the film impressed me a lot. It was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up, trying to decide who they wanted to be, and making decisions as bad as good. I was dazzled by the beauty of Lonette McKee, the gorgeous dresses they could eventually wear and the quick dialogue. As someone who was also raised by a single mother, I could really identify with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem more real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
