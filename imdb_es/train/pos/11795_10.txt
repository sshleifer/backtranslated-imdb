I will never forget this movie or the events that led to Jonestown in Guyana. It just seems so tragic but you have to say it. Powers Boothe offers a dominant performance as the Rev. Jim Jones leader from darkness to total madness. I would have won an Academy Award easily if it was released in theaters. It's the kind of miniseries that you will not forget. He will not forget the images of brutality, control and obsession of his leader's cult. His rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered paradise. Mass suicide is appalling, almost unrealistic to anyone's imagination as to why so many people (over 900) volunteered or resisted JOES's orders. No longer do mini series like this where we are left without an open mouth and hungry to know what happened to others.
