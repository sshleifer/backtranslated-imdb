Of course it may not be a classic, but it is full of classic lines. One of the few films that my friends and I quoted from all the time, fifteen years later (maybe it was in Cinemax many times!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie; it looks like he can not. discover how to play it, but you are surrounded by a fantastic cast that knows exactly how to play this parody. Are you looking for a movie to cheer you up? This is all, but rent it with friends, it will make it even better.
