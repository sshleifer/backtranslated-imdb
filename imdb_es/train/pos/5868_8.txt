I really liked that movie. It is rare to see the post-partum of Vietnam, and this film, without combat scenes and exciting bombs and shots, succeeded. I had no idea what would affect me so much. What an amazing look at how veteran extraterrestrials feel. It was hard to see, frankly. We all understand the fight and the kind of drama of Apocalypse Now, but this is very different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can not. It made me very aware of a large group of men who are trembling lost in the United States. I can not relate, I can not sleep, I can not have romantic relationships, I can not deal with "normal society". They feel totally separated. This is a great tragedy, and one that is not addressed enough. Yes, we have changed our attitude towards Vietnam veterans, now we like them, but so what? It does not seem to have made any difference to them. It's too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I do not have other criticisms.
