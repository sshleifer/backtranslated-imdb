My only minor complaint with the movie I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty minutes in the test scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER present themselves wonderfully as young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESEY who gives the most lively and credible performance. The French accent MARIUS GORING is a delight (he even comments on Technicolor) as the celestial messenger sent to claim Niven when his death in wartime is not reported due to carelessness. Goring has some of the most ingenious lines and offers them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> Seeing this tonight at TCM for the first time in twenty years, I think it is a supreme example of how wonderful the year 1946 was. Films Technicolor photography, somewhat dim and not at all garish, It is excellent and the way it changes to B & W for the celestial sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is the kind that really catches the eye. a spectator in the fantastic aspects of the story, and Niven's tense conversation with the radio operator Hunter as his plane crashes into Earth unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. Truly a wonderful movie from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
