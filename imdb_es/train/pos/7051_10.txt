Let me start by saying that "War, Inc." It is not a cup of tea for everyone. However, it is very nice (and it makes you think - "Oh, shit"). The comedy involved in the film is not obvious at all, it is quite subtle (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning service, etc.) and it changes with the twists and turns in the plot. <br /> <br /> I may be the only one, but I will not compare this with "Grosse Point Blank", because it is different. John Cusack, I would not say it was "amazing" or "brilliant", but it was good. On the other hand, her sister (Joan Cusack) was amazing in her delivery of comic lines and time, even though she was not in the movie (I would say the same for Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to achieve it. Hilary Duff is very commendable for her role as Central Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and she does a very good job (although her accent is a bit unreal). <br /> <br /> In general, the film is what I would call "entertaining". It does not have a particular story, and it is quite silly at times, but it has a subtle message. I would say it's worth a watch.
