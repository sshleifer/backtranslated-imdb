May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for the historic appointment with Mussolini. Emotions, tensions and forms of self-affirmation. An empty town, a housewife and a journalist. The meeting of two different worlds. Shelter for a mother with a sad life. Short filler for a classic victim. A story about loneliness and silence. About the shape of the corners of life and desire as the form of struggle. The great character- a book given on a spring afternoon. This film is a poem, notable for the art that describes the nuances of common loneliness. A plea for an ineffable relationship with reality. And with your inner world. The images of Il Duce, the awkwardness of Antonietta, the patience and fragility of Gabriele, the director's art to give the sensation of script to two great actors make this film sublime, a foretaste of subtle delicacy, a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary verdict, on the essence of life and the repulsive of any tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of a magnificent intelligent performance. A clear masterpiece.
