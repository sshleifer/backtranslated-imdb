Spielberg's first dramatic film is not disappointing. It's a beautifully made movie with no flaws about the life of an African-American woman. It also shows that not all films that have an African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be controlled by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is Spielberg's ability to do. It's very realistic even though it's based on a book. In addition, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. And usually, he is only himself in most of his films. But in this, he branches out completely and is someone else for once. But, the endurance performance of the entire movie comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She is excellent like Celie. You will never forget these characters once you have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I heard that the musical version of it will also be a movie, and all I can say is: I hope it's as good as this, because this is a movie that should not be missed.
