I gave this movie a 10/10 with some reluctance, since it is difficult to praise something that obsessed me and terrified me for years. The pure threat in the woman with the black face is just pure horror and the music that accompanies it makes the fear worse. <br /> <br /> I saw this when it was the first time on television when I was 10 years old and it really bothered me for years. I am fascinated by the fact that many other users have said this too. There are so many movie reviews that talk about how disturbing or terrifying a movie can be, but you can believe everyone who has published in this forum, this really is something incredibly powerful. I mean, I really like horror movies and I usually find them pretty funny most of the time, but this is really threatening and will probably annoy most people. I have not seen him since he was 10 years old and I'm tempted to see him again, but I'm afraid I can spend a few nights without sleeping. I can not say exactly what it is, but I think it has something to do with the fact that fear is the best weapon of the Woman and that we, as spectators, are as susceptible as we feel fear so intensely. It is remarkable that the feelings of other spectators are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> I have also seen the play, which was an excellent production ... but nothing can compare to this.
