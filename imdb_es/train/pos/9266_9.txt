Ah, the best and funniest movie about female football fans, just a little bit better than the 1982 saga about teenage cheating in north London (qv). By the way, I just saw this in Movie 4 [2008-12-21] and I'm ruining my inability to establish the PVR). <br /> <br /> This is easily my second favorite football movie after "Mike Bassett: Manager of England", but this time with the additional touch of looking like a guerrilla piece to make films from a team that apparently follows making films that are prohibited in the country where they are made (just think of the part where the girls are taken from the stadium just when the sun is setting: quick reactions throughout the year). <br /> <br /> It is rare that a movie makes me laugh out loud, but when the rural soldier escorted one of the girls to the restrooms while he forced her to wear a makeshift mask made from an Ali Daei poster. I could not help but wake up the others in the house with my snorts, especially when the young soldier misunderstood grandfather's assistance calls ... <br /> <br /> Speaking of the toilets, I just wish I could speak in Farsi . I could work writing on the walls of the toilet (yes, there were some scribbles in Roman script, but mostly they referred to American rock bands). <br /> <br /> Also, in the field and Farsi's Theme, do not you think that Omid Djalili sounds like a child when Farsi speaks? Listen to the custody sergeant in this movie and then say "Yes." <br /> <br /> I will not talk about Iran's sexual politics, and I will not talk about the doubtful. interim; My love for this film comes from the script and the editing: first class things. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of my best favorite football movies: 1. Mike Bassett, England coach 2. Out of play 3. Those Glory Glory Days 4. A shot to glory 5. The mystery of the Arsenal stadium
