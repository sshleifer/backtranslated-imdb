I have never commented on a movie before. I saw this movie with my girlfriend last night. I have read comments that say that this movie stays with you. He does it. It's been almost 24 hours and I'm still completely affected. This movie left me wondering. How can I compare myself to a character like Ben who is totally disinterested? I really liked that movie. I love the movies that keep me guessing and asking until the end. I feel predominantly two emotions, happiness and sadness. An incredible feeling of a good movie and very sad too. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end, they were, forever. If you have not seen this movie, get it and watch it. Just make sure you do not have distractions. You will want to see all the nuances in this image. One for my library.
