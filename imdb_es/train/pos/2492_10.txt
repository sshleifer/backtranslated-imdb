This is one of the funniest shows I've seen. It's really refreshing to see him and I was on points many times. I suppose there is also a social conscience factor that makes it quite interesting. If they were white girls, would they have the same reaction? Maybe they would, maybe they would not? The characters know no limits (check my lyrics) and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. My favorites is the bob the builder. He is so stupid that he is a genius. If you like twisted black comedy, then this is for you. If you like to keep up appearances, it probably is not. 3 No blonde is another fun British BBC comedy shown on TV! It's such a funny show and the characters unleashed in the unsuspecting public laugh out loud! It would be impossible to keep a serious face looking at the crazy characters and the reactions of the audience! This series easily adds to the excellent comedies that are produced!
