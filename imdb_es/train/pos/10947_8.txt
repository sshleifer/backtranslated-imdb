The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah's own posture; It is so exaggerated with prejudices that you can not possibly take it seriously. However, the fact is that while most people will "understand" it, it does not mean that everyone will appreciate it. It's a very polarizing and one-dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can surrender there. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because so far all the episodes have been as good as the last ones. <br /> <br /> Like all programs, it's not perfect. Personally I love the program, but there are some huge flaws with it. Racist songs are fun, but they age much faster than Silverman seems to realize, a problem I had with "Jesus is Magic" as well. It seems as if Silverman gave himself a fee for songs per episode that does not need to exist. Not to mention that, although the lyrics of the songs he writes are good, the music, well, is not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show for some reason will attract fans of Monty Python, Vertical Citizens Brigade, etc., it's nothing like those shows. I can see Monty Python all day, but as much as I like this program, I can not see more than half an hour limit at a time. It flattens very fast. The repetition value for this program is also low: the second time around an episode is quite fun, and for the third time, in my opinion, it's boring. <br /> <br /> However, the first time is very, very funny. Give it a shot.
