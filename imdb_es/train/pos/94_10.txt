I'm a big fan of John Denver. I have a great collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when I was originally on TV and I loved it. I have the original vinyl record and the CD. I have the original CD and its later version. However, in the last release several songs are missing. I see that it has been released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. WOW - thinking that a Christmas CD would be worth a lot. For me no amount is worth selling this treasure. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I have never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would love to have any of the two versions. If someone has one available please let me know. Thank you
