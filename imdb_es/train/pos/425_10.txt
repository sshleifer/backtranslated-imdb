I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It is one of my favorites of all times because my father, Nelson Malone, is the horse trainer. I remember clearly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we lived at that moment to do April Love. My dad had been in numerous works and was a talented man. I asked him to try one of the parts offered, and here he came home with the script. How exciting that is! Also, some of my classmates were in the crowd scenes, especially the ones shown at the amusement park. It is very nostalgic every April when I see that the film is shown once again, and Pat Boone's song April Love is still played on the radio. It is timeless and remembers a past time when you watch the movies that you make today with all the sex, rude language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more films like April Love refocus ...
