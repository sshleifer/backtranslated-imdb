This is a really strange movie, and that is NOT a bad thing. It is a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless And a fairy tale. I'm sure some may find this movie a bit too strange, but I loved it. Once again, this director brings together a wonderful cast of people from everyday life (not actors) and gets a great joint performance. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point of view: he only does it in a very absurd way. Ignore corny special effects: after all, it was made in the early 1950s and special effects are not terribly important anyway (or at least they should not be in the movies). Instead, just sit back and enjoy a very strange and silly trip. Unless you're a total fuss, you'll have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, from the first time I reviewed this movie, I have seen another film directed by DeSica that is an absolute must see and that is THE CHILDREN ARE LOOKING AT US. While it is not a fantasy or a light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, however, it is a great movie.
