Maybe some people may consider this a slow movie. However, it is precisely this "slow burning" which allows it to profoundly affect the viewer. Like that first wonderful scene: first, we can hear the voices; then, we are allowed to see the characters; finally, the camera slowly rotates back and to one side and we see another character, a young man who is sitting there, apparently without even listening to the conversation or, at least, not really worrying. The fact that this young man is the main role shows the strategy of the film: allowing the character to develop and be determined by the surrounding environment, but without highlighting the points more than necessary. People come and go, flow in and out of their life. Although the majority of the film follows it (and most of the secondary characters only see themselves when they are close to him, defined according to the relationship maintained with him), we are led to believe that we are being objective, so the The director's touch is very subtle.
