"Hot Millions" is a well-written and well-acted story about an embezzler who steals (wow! - a word too low for an embezzler, according to the main character of Peter Ustinov) a "million" from the London branch an American corporation creating ghost corporations on the continent and using the company's seemingly secure computer to transfer funds to them. (Remember, spoiler police, this is a comedy, not a mystery). <br /> <br /> As of 1968, the description of this film of computers may seem naive to the most informed current population; but as someone who has worked with computers since before this film was released, I would say that even then, this seems to have been written by and for computer illiterates, probably on purpose to enhance the comic aspects of this British film. <br /> <br /> If one has little taste for this type of entertainment, the movie may seem to creep into points. Fortunately, it has a well wrapped end; unfortunately, the final credits give no indication of the classical music used there, the symphonic piece at the end and the piano flute duo in the middle, only the song sung by Lulu that I do not remember at all.
