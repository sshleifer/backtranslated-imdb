"That '70s Show" is definitely the most fun program currently on television. I started seeing it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it, I realized it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also an incredible character while he was there, I really hope he comes back because it's so funny. It's classic when Fez says "son of a bitch!" And when Kelso screams "burn!" That always makes me laugh. Both are great characters and always have something funny to say. The fact that Jackie is sexy is just another reason to watch the show; She started off being very good, but damn, somewhere in season 5-6 she just got really sexy. I have seen most of the episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and still they are very funny. This is one of the few programs that I can watch over and over again and still laugh as much as I did the first time I saw it. The cast is classic; almost all are fun, where with many shows there are only a few funny characters. I will be sad to see that this show ends next year, but it will come off the air as one of the best shows in history.
