As in Amelie, recent French films seem to be taking a stereotypical relationship between men and women, centered on a woman who finds her only true love. In this case, the despair leads to a convict, which leads to his evolution in a mafia prototype. Intelligent and amazing story in many ways, except that the woman is there to support the man. <br /> <br /> For those of us who do not speak French, the subtitles are a bit quick, but not unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, as it seems to be increasingly the case of European films, is great and is in perfect sync with the variations of the film. Nothing seems forced. Visually, it reminds me of several urban horror films. There is a feeling of Wes Craven in Chicago.
