Yes, this gets the ten full stars. It is clear as the day that this filling is genius. The universe sent Trent Harris a wonderfully strange young man, and Harris caught him in a tape, in all that true maladjusted glory you can not pretend. Too bad it ended in a tragedy for the young man, if only an alternate ending could be written for the story of that fellow. The other two steps in the trilogy retell the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of the youth, respectively. The world expands and the strangeness is contextualized when retelling, which allows us to glimpse the strange growth in the vanilla America. Recommended for everyone!
