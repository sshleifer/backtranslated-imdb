"The Ladies Man" suffers a common problem among the films based on parodies of "Saturday Night Live". And that is, a sketch that generally succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes. Although this movie has its laughs, like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a sex maniac of the 70s, and Will Ferrell as a husband obsessed with cuckold wrestling by Leon. So this movie is funny enough, but it's not "Wayne's world"!
