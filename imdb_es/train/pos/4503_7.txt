This short and fun short from 1916, the time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in the comedy, introduces the young Oliver Hardy as a good man who must quickly impress his rich uncle by having a wife and baby to your visit. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not going well and soon there will be more wives and babies than he can handle; plus the obligatory persecutions and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of the early slapstick movie. <br /> <br /> Restored well, it can be seen as part of 'Oliver Hardy's First Movies' and is now available on DVD, an excellent addition to the available corpus of the big-screen favorite comedy duo.
