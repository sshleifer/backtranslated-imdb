This is a very good movie, underestimated action / drama / and a bit historical. <br /> <br /> The basic story concerns Rob Roy's 1,000-pound loan, his theft and the problems he causes for his family and indirectly. your clan members. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a villain and incredible character in this story. Brutally cold and if you look at his face, he seems to be able to turn off his eyes and look completely evil. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also excellent, but I think the writers used the word "honor" 1 too many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well performed and filmed. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the sword plays Very realistic, but not too bloody. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> In general, shy of a classic.
