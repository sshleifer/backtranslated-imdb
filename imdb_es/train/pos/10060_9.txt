Wang Bianlian is an old street artist who is known as the "King of Masks" for his mastery in the art of Sichuan change. Liang is a famous opera performer of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is concerned that a precious art does not die with Wang, so he sows the seed of an heir in Wang's mind. The film is about prejudice, male domination, state of the art, values ​​and, most importantly, warmness <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is in loops. Everything has a meaning. It's a long story that has been edited so well that the length of the movie is only 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes is an artistic film, the next five minutes is a sad movie, the next five minutes is a thriller. He just keeps changing his mood just as his protagonist changes his face. The last scene on the string is phenomenal. Story and script is impeccable. The actors are brilliant. Both the protagonists are artists that can be said in the way they have acted. Very impressive. He was not even nominated for the Oscars. That year, "English patient" won the best Oscar film and won in the category of foreign films "Kolya". "Kolya" was fine and about "English patient", the less he said, the better. Watch it on 9/10.
