In "101 Dalmatians" of 1996, Cruella De Vil was arrested by the Metropolitan Police of London (God bless them) for trying to rob and kill 101 puppies - Dalmatians. All cover of mud and hay, spent the next 4 years in the "can". Now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from jail. I say, that's about 28 years, in years of dogs !!!!! <br /> <br /> Then, in 2000, Disney decided to release a sequel to the hit live action version of the classic movie and it's next. nicknamed "102 Dalmatians". In it, there is a 102nd Dalmatian added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think, I should know, since this was shown recently on television), and the puppy had no spots. In addition, although Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) has escaped again, she wanted a bigger and better coat, made again from the puppies. I especially liked the musical theme! I'm sure everyone loves the song "Atomic Dog" from the 70s or so. And now, we hear a bit of this in this movie! "<br /> <br /> <br />" 102 Dalmatians "is such a wonderful movie that I keep wondering: WHEN WILL THERE BE A" 103 DALMATICS? ??? "LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
