I do not know if this contains spoilers or not, but I do not want to risk being included in the blacklist until the year 3462. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the comments of the viewer who described * Guns, Germs and El steel * as "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist". They can not have seen the same series that * I * did. <br /> <br /> The series * I * view shows the history of European colonization in the Americas and southern Africa without particular inaccuracies. I did not see anything in the series that described Europeans as bad people who got lucky, although Europeans often * had * luck, and luck is not bad. Nor did I see the native peoples portrayed as poor and not very innocent. In any case, the Inca was quite arrogant, as one would expect any leader to be when dealing with foreigners, if their country has not been conquered in the living memory by any other world power. <br /> <br /> I certainly did not see anything that could be interpreted as Marxist or neo-Marxist, except for the most incredibly elastic imagination. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African people * do * have built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. By the time they were at the peak of their successes, the Aztec, Maya, and Inca civilizations * were * as advanced as any other in the world, and so rich; sometimes more. The American and Khoi-san * aboriginal populations were * decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; As European settlers were decimated by tropical diseases such as malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are completely different from all the other peoples of sub-Saharan Africa). <br /> <br /> Therefore, I do not see what some of the other commentators complain about. The only thing I * can find to complain is that the series does not tell me anything I did not know when I finished seventh grade. There really is nothing new in the way of historical information in this film. However, it does present some nice representations of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; The production values ​​are very high. and fill in some holes here and there that were not covered in the Social Studies Class of Mrs. Gruber's Sixth Hour at the Milan High School. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy this, assuming you have one In primary and / or secondary education, you will not learn anything new, but you will have a pleasant and entertaining time reviewing what you have already learned (or should have learned) for when I get to high school.
