"Let's Bowl" began on local television in the Twin Cities. He arrived late at night, something he would trip over while navigating the canal after his seventh bottle of Hamm's. <br /> <br /> Even the ads were produced locally, with Wally outside of Grumpy's Bar, holding a microphone and stuttering nervously - "Ahh ... for you, Steve Sedahl." I'm not sure why, but that always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling contest on the pretext of resolving a dispute between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to the comment and the clips. Sedahl played directly, countered by the strange "Wally Hotvedt" of Rich Kronfeld. Highlights included segments such as "How to properly discard an old bowling ball" (throwing them into a lake) and "Dating Tips", where the duo "date" a pair of prostitutes and Wally ends the bitter complaint. "I could have done it myself!" <br /> <br /> Another segment - what the duo did on their days off - had Steve in the can of beer spilled out of the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls, dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and oversized headphones. Fun! <br /> <br /> Wally's shocked comments about "league players" and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various divisions were also highlighted. <br /> <br /> "Comimos Central" was picked up by Comedy Central and I had some good times, but the network never really knew what to do with it, played it during prime time and emphasized the "competition" of the bowling, which was never the key point of the show. The commercial constants interrupted the flow and the secondary characters (Ernie, Pig, Butch, etc.) were more distractions than anything else. The whole thing seemed hasty and somewhat forced. Even Jon Stewart hinted at Let's Bowl on the daily schedule (is not that enough, sarcastic jokes?), An ignominious treatment for a program that deserved much better. <br /> <br /> How often does a "Let's Bowl" appear? Do you present yourself in the world of modern television, a mix with local flavor of comic genius and total shit? The networks have the "total shit" part, but it's sad to see them kill such a dark, strange and funny gem like "Let's Bowl". <br /> <br /> We hope you publish it on DVD.
