The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It is full of comic characters and interesting situations, starting with the cheerful and innocent Pecker (played in an attractive way by Edward Furlong), who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters are Pecker's friend, Matt ("he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy"), Pecker's sister, Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother, who discovers life in a statue of the Virgin Mary in her room. . <br /> <br /> The film gently points out how every day life has many riches to offer, and manages to make this point without being too clumsy about it. There is always the risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of "ordinary people", to slip into a "holier than you" kind, but "Pecker" avoids these traps, allowing the public to grasp the point while It allows. enough breathing space for viewers to compare this message with their own thoughts on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend the film mainly because it's very funny.
