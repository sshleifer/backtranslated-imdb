This is a meeting, a team and a great episode of Justice. From hesitation to resolution, Clark has made an important leap from an adolescent with problems who feared a controlled fate, to a Superman who, like Green Arrow, leaves his emotions aside to his few loved ones, ready to save the entire planet . This is not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; It is also about deciding what is most important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope the subsequent episodes will strictly conform to what Justice shows without any "rewind" momentum and put a good end here on Smallville --- and a wonderful start for Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between Lex and the Team. Nine stars should give you enough credit.
