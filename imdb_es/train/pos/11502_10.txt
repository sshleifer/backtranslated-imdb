As a forty-something urban explorer and a fan of the original Kolchak series: Night Stalker since my childhood, one aspect that has not really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration that Carl's character carried out during the series. Always managed to get into a large abandonment, sewer or tunnel after another. Armed only with his trusted flashlight (okay, he had some flares in the tunnel of the primal monkey episode) and his camera, he never took any other equipment to protect himself or facilitate exploration. <br /> <br /> Like many here, I recently bought the DVD package of the two pilot movies and the later episodes of TV, and I have been slowly reviewing all the programs. And although I remember seeing them in the early 70's when they were first broadcast, they spent more than 30 years ... many of them seem new again. Campy, dated and cheesy, but charming and very entertaining. They just do not do things like this these days. Now they are all regurgitated side effects with predictable characters and diagrams. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16 year old daughter has been sitting to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them (she enjoys the genre). It gives me hope and faith that the series will continue for the new generations of fans in the coming years.
