A few summer space campers were accidentally sent into space by a robot. And the oxygen in the ship was falling short. They had to send someone to a space station to get the gas tanks, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> First, the plot of this movie is not possible in real life. But it gives the feeling that everything you feel is possible if you put your heart inside. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see those young actors who still look the same after so many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in 2000, it was filmed in 1986). There are many people in that movie who still work in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The view was great from outer space. It does not seem unreal. It lasts approximately 2 hours, runs so fast that you will not even notice it. You know it's not real, but we let you catch it until the end. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good family movie. <br /> <br />
