Great movie, enough laughs and action for any audience. <br /> <br /> Since the last person who published in this movie was in charge of calling Woody Allen incestuous and not commenting on the movie, here I am. <Br /> <br /> The movie follows an unlikely duo, Johansson and Allen, as they follow a suggestion given them by the ghost of a recently deceased English reporter. Their search takes them to the murderer's house and, finally, to a somewhat tragic end. But do not let the plot fool you, the movie is truly hilarious and the acting is magnificent. <br /> <br /> It seems that as the directors reach a certain age they really do things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack seem to make the most imaginative work of their respective careers. Also, when you watch the movie in a theater pact, you can say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to really come back. The second that came on the screen lit up the audience. There is something about man and it really shines on Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's worth the trip.
