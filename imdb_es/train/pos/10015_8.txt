The popular radio narrator Gabriel Nadie (Robin Williams, squalid and speaking in low and hypnotic voice) is known and befriends a boy of fourteen years of Wisconsin named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who has written a book detailing the sexual abuse of their parents. For starters, Pete has AIDS and this forces Gabriel even more, since his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, well) turns out to be an HIV survivor. <br /> <br /> He also becomes familiar with Pete's guardian, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to both of them in person and goes to Wisconsin, he discovers some secrets that he (naturally) was not prepared to find. <br /> <br /> Based on real events that happened to Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this film moves much faster (90 min., maybe minutes more) than one would think that a film of this genre would be executed. That's good, because it keeps the action and the plot lean and clear. It is bad because it leaves several holes in the plot and does not stitch any of the openings of the plot or the background story. I would prefer not to go into any great detail, except to say that, if you are not familiar with Maupin's works or your personal history, it feels a little out of place here. Still, the performances of Williams (I would have loved to hear more of his narration, personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and much of the cast (the waitress at the restaurant Collete's Donna does a great job with a small part she has! ) are first class and the mood set here, namely, the cold and lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York, provide an excellent framework for this story. It may have extremes that do not bind particularly well, but it is still a compelling enough story to follow.
