Garde à Vue must be seen several times to understand the subplots it contains. If you're not used to French Wordy movies, based on conversation and the battle of wits instead of action, do not even try to see it. You will only get boredom to death and the sure opinion that French films are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a neat film, essentially based on dialogues (written by Audiard by the way) and cruelly cuts the veil of appearances. <br /> <br /> Why would Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child killer instead of telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom he has a sexual relationship of 8 years. His wife knows it, is jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still the death penalty) instead of revealing the only "pure and innocent" aspect of his unfortunate life.
