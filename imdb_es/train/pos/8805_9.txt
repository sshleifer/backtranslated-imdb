A mosaic about 911. The 11 stories of 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (the first, for example), sometimes they said to the Americans "we have had more deaths than you and you supported the murderers" , sometimes really weird (but highly symbolic and interesting). I really loved Claude Lelouch (the personal life of a couple in New York, which shows that our everyday "problems" are not important), Shoei Imamura (extravagant, strongly against wars in general), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism in spite of the terrible misery of the day to day, and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, who has moral difficulties to accept the policy of the United States towards the Arab countries) I am very pleased to see that many Americans liked this movie, it shows that we (or they? We are still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) we are still interested in other cultures and we can question the past and present actions of our government, as we should do in a democracy .
