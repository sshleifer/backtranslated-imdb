If this is supposed to be a representation of the American serial killer, it is considered to be clearly average. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Duchovny] travels all over the country to California to document the most famous killers in the United States, not knowing that one of them his white trailer, trash travel companions [Pitt] is a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Rather predictable in everything, this has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis represent their roles well, but I would not bother to see them. again
