Good movie. Tells a children's fantasy story, tells us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures should be taken to behave differently. Or at least the feeling: that you have to break all the rules if you want to break one. If I wanted to express love for someone I do not know, how would I do it without creating a pressing social situation? It is also about fascism deciding on the cultural life of others, what kind of culture is stuck in our throats. What gives Disney or FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice. Are not you allowed to drink your morning coffee? Do we have to listen to the cries of NRJ, see the stupid headlines in the tabloids and the commercials on the street before we even had our morning coffee?
