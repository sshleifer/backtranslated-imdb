Okay, I do not see too many horror movies, and the reason is movies like 'Dark Remains'. I captured this on a DVD (surprisingly full of features) and I freaked out like a fool. In fact, the only extra that I think was missing from the DVD was a pair of new pants. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I told someone when I realized that I had only seen 10% of that. The rest of the time I had been watching the pizza at my coffee table, nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if it really covered my eyes. The few times I dared to look at the screen I jumped so hard that I decided not to look again. <br /> <br /> The shooting is solid and the situation of the characters is really convincing. The simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump button, it's just a forest, a cabin and a disused prison, and A LOT of darkness. The most surprising thing to me was the fact that while this clearly was not a multi-million dollar production, the effects of makeup really seemed to be! In addition, it is obvious that this is a movie made by someone with a great love for cinema. The sound design and the music really made use of my surround sound system as many Hollywood movies have never done. I noticed online that this movie won the LA Shriekfest, a really important achievement, and I think the festival had seen the clear talent of the filmmakers, and probably a lot more of this film than I did. <br /> <br /> Turn on the sound, turn off the lights and, if you want to keep your girlfriend, order a pizza.
