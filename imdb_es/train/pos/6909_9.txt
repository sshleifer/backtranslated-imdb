['... and if you are very, very good, it will look like Moon Over Parador. <br /><br /> This movie had a somewhat silly story, but after all it was a fantasy, and the casting and acting were successful! Dreyfuss was perfect as the actor / impostor, full of all the small neuroses and vanities that you imagine the actors would have. You get an idea of how the actors are behind the scenes. <br /><br /> This was one of the best roles of Dreyfuss, just as his character has his best role as personifying the dead dictator! And the farewell scene: like something out of Casablanca, by the way! <br /><br /> Raul Julia was excellent as the Paradorian Chief of the Secret Police. You get some really funny lines, some of which are tributes to other movies, like &quot;Gather the usual suspects!&quot; <br /><br /> And Sonia Braga was excellent as the bride, as well as being a very popular number: &quot;You should get an Oscar for tonight!&quot; <br /><br /> Let&#39;s not forget Johnny Winters as the agent of the CIA and the various guest stars playing: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett, all perfectly done. <br /><br /> In short, a memorable romp under the moon hostel. <br /><br /> -R.']
