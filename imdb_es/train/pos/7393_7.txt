This movie was awesome. My first experience with a foreign film was neither too long nor too complex. I enjoyed the subtitles myself; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and his late brother after a long separation seemed clich√© at first, but it turned out to be very moving and realistic. There was also some subtle humor to not depress or bore the audience.
