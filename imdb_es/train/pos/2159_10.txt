First, there is NO way in which the remake can be so good, because Japanese society is very different from ours and plays such an important role in this film, as explained in the opening narrative. It adds to the humor, as well as the warmth of this movie. There are a lot of different support characters / personalities. Everyone is part of making this wonderful movie. This film is full of comedy that is not as vulgar as most of the "raw comedies" of today. However, it can still make you laugh out loud. The reality is that, in real life, you do not have the option of who you work with or with whom you go to school ... etc. This film really emphasizes that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome small differences. Not to mention that it's a great secondary plot and a lot of humor. This is a story about dance that actually has a story, and a good one about that. There are some previous stories that are not out of place, but that actually support the main story. Truly a well written movie. The dance is also great. It turns out that I'm a fan of any movie with dancing of any kind, because of that aspect. However, this film goes beyond any other with dance, in the fact that it is a story. First and simply written about dance in Japanese society. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
