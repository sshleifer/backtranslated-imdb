After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that has something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still fine. Morgan Freeman was just like God. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Correll in "THE DAILY SHOW!" <br /> <br /> I like the film choices of director Tom Shadyac. He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three of them and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a great comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he has and tell a meaningful and intelligent story is hard to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie. My guess is that the first drafts of the script had more biblical references, but they were cut because the producers were afraid of offending people. That is very bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My rating: <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
