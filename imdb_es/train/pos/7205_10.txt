Deathtrap is not a whodunit. It is a who will do who first. It's so hard to describe this movie without revealing anything, so I'm not going to mention anything else about the plot. In regards to acting, it is the most important role of Cris Reeves as Clifford, a young playwright. You really see the range in your acting skills in this film from "exhale cheeseburgers" to downright scary. Clifford is such a difficult role to play and in the staging of this I have never seen Clifford play well on both ends of the spectrum. The actor interprets him as a puppy or a homicidal maniac. Reeves is the only person I've seen who has the character at all times. As for Michael Caine, he's ... well, he's Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this film, as good as it always has been.
