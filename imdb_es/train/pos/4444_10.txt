Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie because it has no connection to the first two films of Demons. And with the "Demons III" in the title, one would assume that he would. The problem is that this movie was never created to be part of the Demons series. The distributors only one "Demons III" on its original title "The Ogre" to take advantage of the popularity of other films. The new DVD release of this image in the United States has the title "Demons III: The Ogre" in the art box, but the movie only says "The Ogre". I do not know if the previous releases had the title "Demons III" in the film itself, but this new release seems to be a white lie. If you can beat "Demons III" in the title, you could enjoy it in "The Ogre". It starts with a creep introduction, and it keeps quite dragging all the time. There is no gore and movie movies slowly, but I still dug it. Just do not expect it to be like the other Demons movies. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try it.
