The film "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones impels the viewer on a journey of redemption as the main character takes control of the wheel and puts his life in order. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and update what matters most. These truths become evident both to the characters and to the spectators as they laugh and muzzle the credits with them. The simple but attractive \ wardrobe configuration keeps you guessing about what you will see next. You can not help but smile and laugh at the antics that happen in this movie. I can not wait for your second effort. It's only a matter of time before Jones attacks again. Bravo!
