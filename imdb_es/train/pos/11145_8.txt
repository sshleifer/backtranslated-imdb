After racism, the rural exodus, also known as migration from the side of the country, is another socio-political issue of the sixties. WestSide Story had treated racism with a love party in an artistic vision. Now, Midnight Cowboy faces the rural exodus through a tragedy of friendship from a psychological perspective. It has a very serious end that we are witnesses of the death of one of the two companions of destiny. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger skillfully offers us the deepest, most secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of New York City. scoria While the handsome Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women in the world who ask him to share a fantasy of wild love, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in Florida clean and sunny. As a result, Joe becomes a swindler to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a thief to collect enough money to migrate to Florida. In addition, Ratso helps Joe find a way to do what he can. They begin to share everything in life. They share food, share medicines, share an uninhabited house, share their earnings and, therefore, share a destiny. Unfortunately as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing that makes all beautiful women beg him to have fun; And besides, Ratso can not see Florida because his heart fails because of his illness while he was on the bus that takes him there. <br /> <br /> The Might is always right, and the Feeble has no right to daylight. From there, "Midnight" gives the objective view. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Each aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who carry their inevitable destiny. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative vision of a sociopolitical problem, the rural exodus.
