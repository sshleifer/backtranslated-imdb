In September 2003, Jonny Kennedy, 36, died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Distrofic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest contact, leaving his body covered in agonizing sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. In his last months, Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and his death, and the result was a film, the first broadcast in March, which was an encouraging, bewildering and provocatively humorous story of a singular man. Without leaving the grim reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the fullest. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and shown for the first time in March 2004, The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become the most talked-about documentary of that year. It attracted nearly five million viewers and, after the screening, the public donated more than half a million pounds to Jonny's charity, DEBRA. A Memorial Fund of Jonny Kennedy has been created to raise another half million to ensure that Jonny Kennedy leaves a legacy of one million pounds.
