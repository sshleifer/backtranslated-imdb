The end of an era was released here in the United States in the spring of 2002 with "The Rookie", a live action movie from Disney that seemed to be "the best for the end !!!!!" It took place here in Texas! Actually, the story started in West Texas, as evidenced by an area code found on a sign there. It was a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to become a professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: it was very nice !!! !! It was a very good sports movie, from the trilogy "The Mighty Ducks". He had also taken the spectators through Texas, from somewhere between the Panhandle and El Paso to the Metroplex (where I live). I can say it because I recognize that stadium (it was "The baseball stadium in Arlington;" now it's "Campo Ameriquest"). It was nice to see the end of Disney's "Golden Age" in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Golden Age of Disney <br /> <br /> 1920s -Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "It all started with a mouse ... and it ended with baseball. " (sobs) <br /> <br /> 10/10
