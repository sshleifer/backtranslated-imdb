This is a good job. Very attractive and attractive enough plot to keep my interest in everything. Its main disadvantage is that it looks like it was made for TV: full screen, and although there were several sex scenes, there was no nudity (but it did come close!). Strange, too, since Netflix shows that it was qualified as R. <br /> <br /> Nonetheless, very exciting, and I would like Alicia Silverstone to make more movies like this one. <br /> <br /> A Netflix critic said it was part of a series, but I could not figure out what series that is. However, I would like to find out, because this movie was SO good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 08/23/2005
