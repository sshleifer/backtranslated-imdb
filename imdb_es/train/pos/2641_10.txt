['Green Eyes is a great movie. In the current context of support for our troops, it is interesting that this film shows the lack of respect that the soldiers received to fulfill their duty during this period. From a historical point of view, the end of the Vietnam War left us all with something to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this film, and he deserved the credits he received writing &quot;Green Eyes&quot;. I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often, or not at all. This movie is the kind of movie that should be seen on TV every year, like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of a man to his lost son is completely moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky']
