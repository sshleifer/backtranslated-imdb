This movie plays very well with an audience. Especially once the persecution begins. In addition, Trevor Howard with his sensible and intelligent charms and Jean Simmons with his innocent attitude and piercing eyes are great together. <br /> <br /> The film begins as a psychological drama, but after the murder it continues in a chase thriller as the two drivers head to the border. Some may think that the persecution is superfluous, but in reality the persecution is essential because it helps to clear the mind of the character of Jean Simmons to get her out of the oppressive house, in addition to helping to get the real murderer, who is suddenly put in Such Position they have to finish the job. The assassin rightly believed that once the Simmons character was arrested, she would be rejected. And it is true that her lack of control in the home, as well as the evidence that points her way, it is not possible that she has left the charge of murder. The persecution that occurs helps reveal the truth. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining movie. Look for it if you can find it.
