I do not remember ever seeing this before tonight, probably the title sounded so ordinary that it kept happening to me. But it is a well-designed Western b, with an interesting and relational plot that is complemented by the act of good to cheesy. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum goes into an open city to look for his wife and the news of his daughter, and remains for a time as a tamer town. As usual, good business people have mixed emotions: they want to get rid of the bad guys, but they like the business they bring. It still applies: relax the laws of beverages and games of chance and encourage the industries, but pretend to deplore the sordid effects that can have on ordinary people. The fascinating thing about this film is the cynically intense portrait of Mitchum about the cleanliness of the city of the bad guys, and the acceptance of the people of the city that their violent methods were the only ones. Favorite bit: the sudden disappearance of 2 of the bad guys in the Red Dog room. The shot in the main hall bordered on the unpleasant, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> In general, a very good movie with its only flaw that tends to be a little moody, not so good for Do-Gooders who would probably prefer a life of negotiation with Evil instead of ending it.
