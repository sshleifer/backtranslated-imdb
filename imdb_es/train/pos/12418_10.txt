This film and its sequel, Barry McKenzie has his, they are the two best comedies that have been produced. A great story that a young Australian travels to England to claim his inheritance and meets his companions, who are as adorable and innocent as he is. <br /> <br /> It's a block full of big, sayings, Where else could you find someone who needs a drink so strong that it's as dry as a dead donger? Great characters, the best actors, and has excellent sheilas and more consumption of Fosters than three other films together. Of first class. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you've ever heard, and it's full of great celebrities. Definitely my two favorite movies of all time, I see them at least once every fortnight.
