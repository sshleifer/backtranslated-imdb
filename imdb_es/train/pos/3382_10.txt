I have not always had the feeling of a movie that could be visionary. But clearly this film has the seed of a premonition. <br /> <br /> We should not be alarmist and see Armageddon in something because it seems to fit with our emotions of the moment. But do not we say this about "1984"? If James Orwell had known that the Internet had become a reality shortly after 1984; In fact it was in 1994; He could have reconsidered writing his story as he did. Retained vision rewarded <br /> <br /> It does not matter. What does matter is that we often consider ourselves superior to our environment, but in fact we become emotional with an "apple of love" when the need knocks at our door. A snapshot of ourselves in old age. <br /> <br /> Whatever the timeline that is shown to be for us, I know we have not yet seen the beginning. <br /> <br />
