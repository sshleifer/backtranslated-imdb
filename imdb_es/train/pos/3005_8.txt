This continues to be the benchmark for judging all adults of the Golden Age, and given the limited technology and dubious ethical standards of the authorities (on the screen) it is good against all generations of similar attempts since cinema and television. Fast and furious with a lot of Warner Bros wipes, and fortunately there is no time for a love interest that advances at a gallop, leading the splendid cast to the violent end. I never understood why the prosecutor had to trace Vance everywhere, I always thought they were on the desk. Palette, as a detective, but especially Girardot as a doctor, is deliciously eccentric and does not have a PC. When looking at the second murder victim, he suspects there were too many people in the world anyway. Of course, it's William Powell as Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director) that makes the film what it is: when did Powell fail? <br /> <br /> The army of policemen at the crime scene did not do it. They really do a very good job of finding the second corpse and the unconscious dog did it! The best thing is that Vance tells us the whole sequence of events surrounding the murders: the unreliable model sets are combined with fantastic traveling camera angles to produce a very modern and surprising feeling with what has happened before. The only problem is that, as usual, the conclusion can not coincide with the general deductive processes that are shown along and a somewhat artificial ending is invoked; some of Chan, Moto and many others, of course, could only be concluded in this way as well. But as it happens very fast and it's ... a bit dubious from the moral point of view, it does not diminish my opinion about the status of KMC as a classic! <br /> <br /> All the impressions I have seen of KMC are (in the worst case)) like looking at a bowl of goldfish, so if you are interested in seeing it, hold it until you suck it.
