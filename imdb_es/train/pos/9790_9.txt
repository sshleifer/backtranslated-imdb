Although there is a melodrama in the center or, rather, at the end of this film, the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> Yaara, studying in Princeton, returns to her native Israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend, Talia. Because Yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother, she lost her adoptive sister. And since Yaara, blind from birth, has been guided and guarded by Talia, her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Inevitably, the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death Although without sight, she has vision. Although you can not see, you can find what is out of sight for the "normal" people around you. The film thus becomes an absorbing mystery when Yaara searches for clues in the memories of his relationship with Talia, in the home of his adoptive family, in tapes, newspapers and people in the past and present of Talia. <br /> <br /> Yara is counted From the point of view, the film is also seen from his point of view, while visualizing what he hears, believes and imagines. The solution to the mystery is quite conventional, but the search is done with such subtle care and the response is so beautiful and without fanfare, that the moment of patting is easily forgiven. The truths emerge gradually but inexorably, clarifying not only Talia's life, but also her relationship with Yaara. Tali Sharon, like Yaara, uses her mobile face and voice effectively, and is completely credible as much as the adult child as the teenager. We fully accept your ability at the end of the movie to find your place in the world with more confidence. <br /> <br /> It is remarkable the precision with which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious, the dead. -in the performance of the minor characters, and the interesting decision to represent Talia only as a teenager. I will discuss with Yaara's final statement how she is with Gadi, Talia's last boyfriend, on the edge of a cliff, but that journey to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in view longer than her words will remember.
