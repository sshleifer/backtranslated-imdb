I do not know what movie they saw some of these other people, but they must have seen a "Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration" different from the one I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was both Well done and inspiring. I think it's definitely worth seeing. It is evident from the beginning that great care was taken in the making of this film. The landscape in the background is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film does a good job of portraying Joseph Smith as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are represented with taste and reverence. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
