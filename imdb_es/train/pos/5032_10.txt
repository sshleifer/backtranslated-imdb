The film "Fragility" is actually more a psychological thriller than a horror movie. It has all the trappings of a horror movie, but this is not. "Fragility" is a film about the perceptions of religion and the understanding of the differences between good and evil. <br /> <br /> In "Fragility," a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two children claim to be doing the job. God's work It turns out that they are a trio of notable serial killers called "Hands of God." We observe how the father kills the "demons" in a very brutal way while we convince his children and himself that they are doing the work of God and that what they are doing is correct. He claims that he received a message from an angel that gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons that live here on earth. God has given you a list of names and in exchange for your "services"; he and his children will receive protection, which basically means that the police will never be able to capture them. We see all this unfolding in front of us in a very disturbing way. But what is really worrying about all this is the effect it has on the two children, particularly the eldest son, Adam. The same Adam seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being, that is, until his father and a week in the cellar change all that. He knows that his father obviously lost his mind and he is pretty sure that the same thing is happening to his younger brother, Fenton. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything as if it were his own religion. He seems trapped in the world of God and the demons of his father. I guess this is because he is so young and easily impressionable. But everything that happens to these three is quite convincing, in fact, too convincing. <br /> <br /> The events that occur in the film can be considered as a vivid hallucination that the three main characters are experiencing. I say this because everyone reacts to the situation in different ways and at some point in the movie everyone says they see God. Dad first sees the murders as his mission. His "mission" finally consumes him and quickly becomes an obsession with the eradication of demons. In fact, his hallucination is the main one. His "orders" and the list of names he receives are part of this hallucination. Look at the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to find out where I come from. Fenton, the youngest son, is easily impressed with all this talk about demons and destruction. Because he is so young, it is easy for him to fall into his father's trap. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical towards his father's actions. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> In a way, the hallucination ends when dad is killed towards the end of the movie. (I will not say how or under what circumstances). But I'll say it's not nice. After his death, he advances to this day. (The story is told through flashbacks, as seen through the eyes of the eldest son Adam). Actually, it is Fenton who tells the story, not Adam as originally believed. The story is told in the way he perceived it, through his actions and the actions of his brother. Fenton has gone crazy and continues with what his father started by attracting the FBI agent to his trap. <br /> <br /> Since religion is an important theme in this film, the film also shows how easy it is for religion to be misunderstood by those who do not fully understand it. Before Papa discovered his new mission, he himself did not clearly understand religion or fully believe in a supreme being. Their children, Fenton and Adam, often sang innocent hymns of small children of the church, but nevertheless, they probably did not understand clearly what the letters meant. After the revelation of Dad's newfound mission, they both left in separate directions: Adam doubted there was a supreme being while Fenton was gradually absorbed by his father's madness. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller that will drag you, do not look at it alone.
