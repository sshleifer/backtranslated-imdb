This series premiered at the cable television station "Comedy Central" in the United States. He cut himself to death and showed himself out of sequence. This was sad for the audience that he should have attracted, he did not and he stayed on the road. Fortunately, at the same time my cable company went digital and got the BBC. Thank God I could see "The League of Gentlemen" in order, complete and uncut. <br /> <br /> The company "The League of Gentlemen" is at the height of "Monty Python's Flying Circus" of England and "The Kids in the Hall" of Canada. But ... a warning. <br /> <br /> "The League of Knights", although they are one step further. It is not just about getting dressed in the dragging clothes and lampooning of cultural ills, it goes deeper and much, much darker. I can tell many of you now: it will offend certain groups of people, it will infuriate others. But remember, it's just comedy ... dark, dark comedy. If that's not your thing, do not look. If you think you KNOW dark comedy, look at this: if you get angry and angry, then you do not know at all. <br /> <br /> These guys did it right, and right on the button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I enjoyed the creation of each character. There is a COMPLETE story that is told here from episode one to the end. You can not watch this episode at the same time, anyway, that is one of the charms of this series. Look at it in order. See how creative and elegant and deeply disturbed these guys are. Nobody and nothing is out of bounds. That, my dear ones, is the "black humor". Bravo!
