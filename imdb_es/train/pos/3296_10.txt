Mina Kumari exhibits more style and grace by going from standing to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies. The director has produced more memorable scenes of touching the beauty of what seems possible. Music and dance are of the highest possible quality. It is possible that in the first dance scene the director has all kinds of things in the background: another girl dancing, a drunk falling down the stairs, a lot of activity, but I knew that we would be watching Mina dance and I'll bet unless you've seen this many Sometimes, you did not notice. All in all, perfection.JQ
