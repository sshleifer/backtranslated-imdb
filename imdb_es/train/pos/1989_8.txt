['I admit that I am not so fond of Oliver! As a small child - it&#39;s long, and the story is a bit slow because of all the musical numbers. When I was a teenager I discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself. Instead of thinking of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, consider it a celebration of classical history. The adaptation is loose at best, but in reality, if you&#39;re watching a musical, you&#39;re not there for the story. <br /><br /> Music is the core of this film, and an overwhelming majority is stellar and very catchy. Most or all the cast was involved in the theatrical version of the musical, and it shows in their performances, and I think this is a point in favor. The performances are all in a more &quot;scenic&quot; acting style typical of much older films, and they are very entertaining. The exception is the child who plays Oliver, whose work seems to be cute and stay away from the real artists. <br /><br /> Fagin and the Dodgers are the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job of keeping an intimidating presence on the screen like the menacing Bill Sykes. Even Sykes&#39; bullseye dog performs well. <br /><br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise it, as will those who take musicals too seriously. Addressing faulty historical details or confusing exaggerated stage-type performance with a bad performance will ruin anyone&#39;s enjoyment. Just lie back and enjoy the entertainment: it is much better if you remember that, as a musical, it is a fantasy freely organized around the book, not a strict adaptation.']
