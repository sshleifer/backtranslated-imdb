It was fabulous! Photography, editing, cinematography, music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was the enjoyment of "slumming", without going through danger. We were there! The sequences of the dreams and the end of the flashback sequence were recent. Spoke to me. Keep up the good work! Another of that kind is City of God. Also, do not laugh! - The comedy, Looking for Susan desperately. Beautiful sets of sets, with great performances of all. I'm sorry, I think Training Day also fits that genre, with fantastic performances by a cast. I had to change the channel in some of the sandy sequences, but in general, a great movie!
