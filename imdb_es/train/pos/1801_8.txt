['I saw this movie when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it at that time and I still do now. But now I realize that this is pretty &quot;adult&quot; for a movie with a G rating, especially the notion of dying and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together, and Reynolds singing voice is appropriate for a scrap dog. There are some good songs that range from optimists (&quot;Let&#39;s Make Music Together&quot;) to downright emotional (&quot;Home to My Heart&quot;). The plot seemed good, although it shoots on a tangent once or twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I&#39;ve seen in animation. A movie that is worth experiencing.']
