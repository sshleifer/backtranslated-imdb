Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters literally go through almost the entire film, chasing each other due to strange circumstances and funny coincidences. As they run, we see what is going through their minds and how they got to where they are at this moment. The act of running is a metaphor for the lives of these people who have bad luck. Somehow, what they are really looking for is not what they were originally pursuing, but the meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes everyone feel really alive. The great adventure of life-changing running comes to an end when you accidentally find yourself in the middle of something big, violent and so absurd that it's fun in an intelligent way. One of my favorite movies of all time by genius director Sabu.
