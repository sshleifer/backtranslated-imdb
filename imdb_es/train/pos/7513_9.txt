"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Starring: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathairn <br / > <br /> MPAA Rating: "R" (for nudity, sexual content and a bit of language) <br /> <br /> It seems that every celebrity today is getting a biography about their life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, the biopics are very elegant at the moment. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is the last of these released on DVD. It presents Gretchen Mol as the most famous pin-up model in the world, Bettie Page and was filmed mainly in black and white with certain color extracts. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Finding Neverland", however, this film will not be one to watch out for at this year's Oscars. This film lacks the emotional resonance shown in other biopics and most of the most dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are completely ignored or simply suggested. This does not mean, however, that it is a bad movie. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a completely entertaining and satisfying film, a solid cinematographic work. This film focuses more on the exciting career of Page and the thin line between sexuality and pornography. It was filmed with fervor and care and the direction of Mary Harron captures the appearance of the period that most filmmakers only dream of. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Whether you know her as an icon or as a simple porn star, you know her. She is a woman who had a very profound impact on American culture only by revealing more skin than is considered appropriate at that particular time. Now, most people know it as one of the first sexual symbols of the United States, a legend for many models, especially those of Playboy and other magazines aimed at adults. She lived in a time when showing an inch of meat under garbage could get someone arrested and the page-style photos were precisely what should push the American public to a rampage. In fact, the photos launched a full Senate investigation into common decency and the difference between harmless movies and pornography. <br /> <br /> The performances on "The Notorious Bettie Page" are absolutely wonderful, with Gretchen Mol standing out. Her performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant. I understand that, when it was announced for the role, many people were skeptical. His name is not one that immediately comes to mind when I think of great performances. Now, it will. She completely assumed the role and attracted me with her vulnerable and, at the same time, very attractive performance. David Strathairn just came out of "Good Night, and Good Luck" last year, which gave one of the best performances of 2005. Here, he gives another good performance, although it is little underutilized. I was surprised at how limited your screen time was, but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. The only performance I've seen of Lili Taylor was "The Haunting" (1999). Although most people ignored the movie, it seemed like a nice horror movie, if not completely superficial, and I've also always thought that Taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally disturbed Nell. Here, Taylor gives another credible performance. She gives a very dim performance and offers the perfect performance to complement Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> After everything was said and done, I realized that "The Notorious Bettie Page" can not be compared to other biopics, such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line". It is incomparable to these because it tells the story of a woman and her career, from the beginning to the end. His personal life is briefly implied, but it is really his impact on the world that becomes the climax. We see the film knowing that Page will finally take care of everything and we know the impact that their decisions will have, but they rarely show us the impact they will have on their personal lives. She is a woman who never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself. After all, she was an adult model turned Christian missionary. This movie does not over dramatize anything. She could have included Page's fictional moments sobbing hysterically and begging God to forgive her. He could have shown Page running and screaming through the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of his past and yet he does not. "The Notorious Bettie Page" tells a simple story and that is rare by today's standards. Fortunately, it's quite refreshing. Final thought: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing film with absolutely incredible cinematography. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 9/10 (A)
