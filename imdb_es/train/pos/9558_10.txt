So I consider myself pretty big in the anime scene, with very few shows that I simply will not watch. <br /> <br /> This show, however, I would recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly The most original series to date, has almost everything I can ask for. A parallel story, so to speak, about unconditional love that will NOT be admitted, a very shameless comedy and a cast of voice actors very well together (translation in Japanese and American). <br /> <br /> If not for the terribly funny aspect, it would be, just another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I have noticed, a 'I love or hate it', very few people I have seen introduced This series will end with a dislike for it. <br /> <br /> Original to the core, with everything you could ask for in an afternoon, bet on the house in this series. I am ready to ENSURE you will enjoy it.
