I started watching this movie without expecting anything, just another movie to watch, but from the first twenty minutes, the artwork and the main character, which is enigmatic, does not speak much, they really got me involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully acted and really touching. It's a bit slow but the dive was complete. The direction was amazing to let us know parts by part of the story that led to the conviction of Joey and his life behind bars. The music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes. The end was unexpected with a turn I did not see coming. It's not the kind of movie we see often.
