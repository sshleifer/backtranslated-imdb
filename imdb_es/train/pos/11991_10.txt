Ahh, Talespin! What can I say that has not already been said about this great show? Nothing! This is undoubtedly one of the best written programs I've found, live or in animation. The newest things are too stupid for my taste, and some of the "mature" things for which I have to scare the children. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> The stories are attractive and very plausible. Some of them could even be extended to an hour or two for a movie. Episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very dramatic and still fun for children and adults alike. Then there are the pure comedy episodes like Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck on You, where the emphasis is on hilarity. I can laugh to tears in some options. <br /> <br /> The dramatic aspect is very deficient in most of today's shows (at least, those that are not specifically oriented towards it), especially in cartoons. In the episode Stormy Weather, for example, Kit Cloudkicker decides that he will join an aerial circus, but Baloo believes it would be too dangerous. In the biggest fight of the episode, Baloo yells at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan, to which Kit shouts "NO! You can not tell me what to do! YOU * NO * * * MY * * DAD *! " and buries his face in his pillow. The next day he leaves for the aerial circus. This type of drama is a rarity in a cartoon, and would be welcome in those that are created today. <br /> <br /> The characters have a lot of depth. Baloo is more or less the way he is in The Jungle Book, more or less a few degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a shrewd business woman whose ideas for money, while good in theory, are rarely good in practice. Molly is a cute little girl, but you can not let that fool you. She can be a real hell sometimes. Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. He does not trust adults very much unless he is attracted to them, and has a tendency to break relationships. Observe his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs the grappling hook: it looks like he's ready to face him with a pirate. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the drama combined with the real chemistry between the characters that make this show # 1 in my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost father and son. This is well demonstrated in All's Whale That End Whale when Baloo takes Kit's word that Seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of side-by-side with the other adults. The relationship of Baloo and Becky is also realistic, because Baloo's motivation to work comes from wanting to buy back the old sea duck, not necessarily a desire to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if I recovered the Duck I would still do jobs for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> The Sea Duck, not to mention all the other aircraft in the series, is designed quite realistically. The functions of the airplane do not change only once throughout the series (it is also difficult to get that continuity) and, unlike most "superplanes" of other cartoons, it does not have a single weapon on board (unless that counts handles!), and instead relies on the astute ability of a pilot to get out of trouble. It's hard to think of a hero vehicle that does not have some kind of turret, laser cannon or even a gun somewhere on board. And the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a caricature today. Also, it's such a great design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Forever. Period. Definitely worth all ten stars!
