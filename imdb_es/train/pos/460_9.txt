This is a new and wonderful series of crimes, which brings together three old stalwarts of British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired detectives to help clarify old cases, under the leadership of Amanda Redman, younger and focused on his career. The three old, extravagant and irritable policemen form a brilliant team, applying detection methods of twenty years in a police force that has advanced much since then, sometimes with effect, sometimes to the horror of its superior officers. All three are represented with sympathy, warts and all. There are splendid comic scenes, and some very touching, since each of the three has to accept aging and the legacy of their pasts. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first series of six parts (We are promised another series next year) each of the characters had developed. The widower James Bolam can not accept the premature death of his wife. Lothario Denis Waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather. And even the obsessive Alun Armstrong receives the help of his new friends to fight the demons of his past, and keep taking the medication! While Amanda Redman has to face the too familiar conflict between having a life and a career. The story lines have been interesting, although quite dependent on the wonders of DNA testing. But it is the interaction of four of the best actors in Britain that has made the series not to be missed.
