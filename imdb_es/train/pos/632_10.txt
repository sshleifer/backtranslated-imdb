OK here is how I do this. I rate movies in 10 components. Each component will inherently start with 5 points. Then you can lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> State of mind: action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense: I give this component 10 points. He had a perfect balance of the five aspects. The action was fun and exciting. The romance was not exaggerated, but it was still very emotional and touching. I laughed a lot during the whole movie and I was still captivated by the fantastic drama and the fascinating suspense. <br /> <br /> Parcel: I give this component 10 points. I thought that all the good fairy tales had already been told. I found myself sitting in the theater, I returned to my childhood and in that moment I returned to believe in the unicorns, the evil witches and the shooting stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Film Photography: I give this component 8 points. While the movie captured the story very well at most angles, I found myself more than once trying to figure out what happened right outside the camera. <br /> <br /> FX: I give this component 10 points. I love that they used C.G.I. scarcely. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were terribly realistic. In general, less is more, and this I had EVERYTHING! Deal - I give this component 10 points. Without names and experienced actors alike, the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully evil, Charlie Cox made Tristan come alive, Claire Danes gave emotion to the stars, and I will never look again and Robert De Niro will be the same again. <br /> <br /> Acting: I give this component 10 points. Even the novice actors played their roles perfectly. Once again, I will NEVER look and Robert De Niro will be the same again. <br /> <br /> Character development: I give this component 9 points. This felt a bit rushed and I think if the film had lasted a little longer, they could have made the characters a little bit better. <br /> <br /> Dialogue: I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was intelligent, witty, fun? even the porridge had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Score: I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the whole movie. I do not complain beyond the fact that music could be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Final: I give this component 9 points. End almost perfect! I feel that certain aspects of the end should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more moderate, but the threads were not left loose. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES! Do you see it in the theater? Definitely! Conclusion: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I highly recommend seeing him in the theater, I know I'll be back for a few seconds!
