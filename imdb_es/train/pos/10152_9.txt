I've expected to see this since I first saw him at his job. I finally found it yesterday, February 13, 2002, on Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> The comments of Jim Larson about what is a "funny and sweet story of 2 people crossing paths" were useless. Writers probably should not get a bonus, all the other SROs for making the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie MUST SEE IT. <br /> <br /> The presence of Natasha on the screen is very warm and her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that everything on my favorite list. His television and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for. <br /> <br /> God bless her, her family and her future efforts. <br /> <br /> This movie does not look like it's still available on DVD or video, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would also.
