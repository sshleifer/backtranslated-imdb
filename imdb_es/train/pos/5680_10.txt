Holy shit, this is so hysterical! Why are American comedies not written like that? For anyone who thinks that comedy has to be silly, there is more ingenuity and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels! Hugh Laurie is a complete scream. I could not believe it was the same guy as House! There are so many great lines and jokes in this series that you can watch each show dozens of times and still learn new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is as funny as verbose and put the butler Edmund. This is my favorite of all the Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is wonderful as the somewhat obtuse heart of the series, "the oppressed mass" Baldrick. Some of my favorite phrases: "When someone messes with a Wellington, he really sets foot in it," and Baldrick explains how he got his name and his cousin Macadder "the best kipper salesman" and a homicidal swordsman in Scotland.
