This movie is by far the most beautiful I've seen in a long time! The wonderful animations and the adorable characters (even the bad guys were cute!) Made this one a total winner in my book, and also in the books of those with whom I saw it. I still want to see him again, but I have not had time. Better than Toy Story, which was also good, but not THIS was good.
