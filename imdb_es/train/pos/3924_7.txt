This 1939 film by director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional story of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his judgments (literally) and his tribulations. It is a sentimental film, reasonably well done but hardly impressive. The choice of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems a mistake, because while the actor had the right qualities for the role, even with several centimeters of makeup and a fake nose, he is too handsome for the Honest Abe, who was famous for being homelike. It is a good attempt by Fonda, which is nothing if it is not sincere, but his miscasting cancels the whole movie. The cast is excellent, however, and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverent in his dealings with Lincoln, who presents himself as a little shy of a saint, and in the final scene, the film overcomes the limits.
