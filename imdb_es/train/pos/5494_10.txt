With the partial reconstruction and direct firing, the directors made a formidable documentary about a coup d'etat against President Chávez in Venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the rich Venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the Church ( a Cynical laughing cardinal) and the United States government. It was another chapter in the history of US foreign policy, which Steven Kinzer calls "overthrow" or "sow democracy in the American style." In fact, this intervention backed by foreigners was not only a coup d'état against President Chávez, but also against the democratic majority that elected him. <br /> <br /> That this is a brilliant documentary is strongly confirmed by the violent reactions in favor and against him on the Internet. As St. Augustine said: "Men love the truth when they bathe in their light; they hate it when it is proven that they are wrong. "<br /> <br /> This film is a must for all those who want to understand the world in which we live.
