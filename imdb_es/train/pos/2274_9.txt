Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I did not know it. The only reason I saw him was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the movie brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue and much more focus on the moral issue: reading their anti-Semitic radio commentaries with secret messages hidden from the Americans, in fact contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and, as will be seen later, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. What is more important, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent because these words are never pronounced, even as a narrative. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that it does not open, even in his memories. The internal conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray, but with the help of an excellent performance and photography, this film manages. <br /> <br /> There are other points, such as humor or the ironic use of romantic clich√©s (like the song White Christmas), which make it very different from the average American cinema. I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.
