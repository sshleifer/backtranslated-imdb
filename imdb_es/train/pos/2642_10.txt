This is truly a 'comforting' movie. He won the George Peobody Award, winning "Roots", so he can tell you something of the essence of this movie. I'm looking on the Internet how to order this movie since my previous father-in-law, Eugene Logan, the co-writer of this film has passed away a few years ago, so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him. . I would love to have your only granddaughters, my daughters, watch this movie, as well as convey this wonderful story to your great-grandchildren. My oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was broadcast on television and since then I have been waiting to see her again. One of my friends said it was his favorite movie. I will not 'spoil' this movie for you.
