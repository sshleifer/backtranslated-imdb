I saw this movie in the early hours of the morning when I should have been asleep. This, in itself, was a testimony that Deliverance was a bewitching movie. I think Boorman did a wonderful job directing this movie. How expert was the early scene with the people of the hill and the dueling banjos. It showed so well and from the beginning how intrinsically reserved and simple the people of the area were. Case in point: Near the end of the "duel", the child playing the banjo smiled (loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the child's hand after the "duel", the child was too reserved to answer. The trip down the river never left you bored, sure. The scene of the rape was brutal, but necessary to show what the group was facing in this area of ​​Georgia. I think that Beatty's traumatic shock was well done afterwards. Some have said that he was not affected by the test. I do not agree: if you really paid attention, he did not respond during all the action that followed immediately, in which Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and chased him. It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff. It almost seems that the arrow shot up while Ed was curled up and expected to die, but then you realize that the arrow he had fired before had finally taken effect. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a great movie, and I was hesitating between an 8 and a 9 in my vote, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave him a "1", I gave him a "10" The reasoning of this individual seemed to be based on a personal bias, rather than an objective point of view, and his vote was obviously a non-correlative attempt to lower the rating.
