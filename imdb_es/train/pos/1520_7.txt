Four stories written by Robert Bloch about several people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them. The first is Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees how the murderer on whom he is writing comes to life. Some spooky moments and the turn at the end was good. The second has Peter Cushing obsessed with a wax figure that looks like his dead wife. The third has Christopher Lee, who has a son (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of him. Everything leads to a pretty scary ending (although the end of the story was MUCH worse). The last one is a comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (who chews the stage) and a cloak that turns people into vampires! There is also a nice line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good anthology of terror: nothing terrifying, but the first and the end of the third caused me a bit of chills. Also the room is really very funny and Pitt becomes a VERY sexy vampire! Also the house itself looks beautiful ... and very spooky. It is well run with some nice atmospheric touches. A very good and unusual movie score too. In general, a good anthology of terror that is worth looking for. Try watching it on DVD: the Lions Gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and excellent sound.
