This is not the best Bela Lagosi movie, but it has an old-style approach to the horror entertainment of about 40. <br /> <br /> The brides are falling dead at the altar like flies. I think I'd postpone the wedding until the demon is caught, but it's a horror movie, so I guess people ignore the danger for some reason. Anyway, Lagosi is a mad doctor, who needs young blood to keep his sick and aging wife healthy and happy. He always eludes the Keystone Cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse (who would ever look for a corpse in a hearse?), And the brides are still attacked. <br /> <br /> No movie like this is complete without a Lois Lane type reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own. Good at solving crime, bad at keeping your mouth shut at the wrong times, guess who Lagosi chooses for his next victim. I love the part of "the haunted house" where Lois Lane is trapped by a thunderstorm as a guest in the sinister mansion of Lagosi. Hidden passages, a vampire-like wife, an evil Igor assistant dwarf, and so on. Good things. <br /> <br /> The fairly well-done rhythm keeps the movie moving, and the story is resolved in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, it's worth seeing.
