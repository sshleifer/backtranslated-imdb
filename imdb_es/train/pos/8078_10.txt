Although this was a disaster at the box office, it's my favorite movie. Give a powerful family message. It has a lot of violence and has a song with a group of girls in bikinis. Compared to other Bollywood films, the action scenes in this film are more realistic. It's an amazing combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian godfather, Amitabh portrays him in this movie. Do not read critics' criticisms, they are ignorant. This movie has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama and especially action. So, if you want to see the action more realistic than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), this is the movie.
