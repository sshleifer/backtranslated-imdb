When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring, my first reaction was BRIGHT! However, in future viewings I was provided with much more than a masterful filmmaking. This image has a unique voice that will echo throughout the years of film history. <br /> <br /> The opening assembly provides a splendid palette that Helmer JP Sarro uses to establish his art in this canvas of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as his brush while taking us on a journey that envelops the audience in a tremendous action film that goes beyond the traditional format to which we have become accustomed and immersed ourselves deeply in dark themes of betrayal, revenge. and the importance of companionship. This film is the dream of any director in its essence. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic venture. The writing, provided by the scribe Tim Sheridan, was equally impressive. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors so much presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically speaking, the final scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!) where Vanessa reveals herself as one of the coalitions and villanas all the time, is written in such a dark tone that it is a of the most chilling. Terminations that I've never seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> On a final note, it is obvious that this production was not a small feat. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we must congratulate the producer Scott Shipley, who seems to have creativity and genius to walk alongside Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before had I witnessed such a large production with so much attention directed to every little detail. A work of the producers is one of the most difficult in any film and Shipley makes it look easy. <br /> <br /> Throughout this film are combined creative writing, impressive production and masterful direction. This is the art of the movie at its best. When the end of the movie arrives, the only thing you want is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo Division is innovative, a masterpiece and, most importantly, the Romeo Division is, in fact, art.
