Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging force for other actresses to be careful. She has the audacity to place herself in a tough girl role rarely seen very early in her career (and achieve it), which is a feat that must be recognized. Although his later films pigeonholed it in that same paper, this film was made for its robustness. <br /> <br /> Your character is a romantic student / wrestler / lover, who struggles to overcome his disenchanted existence in projects, which is a little exaggerated in the movie ... but not by a girl. That aspect of this film is not very original, but the story deepens when the heated relationships that this girl has to deal with reach their boiling point and her primordial fury takes over. <br /> <br /> I've seen an actress take such an aggressive stance on making films yet, and I'm glad she's getting that original spin in Hollywood. This movie got a 7 on my part because of the average story of the ghetto youth, but it has such a great actress that it plays a role that is rarely seen in a minimum budget movie. Good job.
