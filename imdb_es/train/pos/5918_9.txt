One of the most interesting films that can be classified as "blaxploitation", "Coonskin" by Bakshi is a rich text full of wonderful information. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appear in the film. The racist image can often be disturbing, but the message of the film was so powerful that the NAACP gave it backing (but only reluctantly). <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a movie. Examination of the dominant atmosphere of racism that Bakshi attempts to deconstruct. Wonderful things
