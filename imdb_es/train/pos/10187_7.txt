Well, I'll be honest: it's not exactly a Sholay. But you can not get a Sholay every week. In fact, I could see different signatures of "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this film. However, as most "inspired" films go, this was a well-inspired, well-managed and well-made one. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to exaggerate her hysteria, but everyone else is commendable. Especially about Dipti Naval: I saw her after a long time, but she has not lost anything of her grace. In fact, she has performed much better than the last time I saw her. Another of the Bollywood stars that seems to become more beautiful as they get older? <br /> <br /> In short, a good watch.
