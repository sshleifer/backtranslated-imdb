Weak writings sometimes? Yes! Cheesy special effects sometimes? Yes! Delicious pleasure guilty most of the time? Yes! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yes! I always liked science fiction when I was a kid, but I found both Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horror stuff and so much crap. It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters, and Carl Kolchak took me to the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mixed with all those weak scripts, special cheese effects, that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars, was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. He had an ironic sense of humor despite the danger, he was an idealist in his search for truth and a realist when accepting compulsory incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials. Furthermore, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done, even if it meant his death, the end of his journalistic career or his time in prison. Despite all his faults, which do not include a taste for clothes, Carl Kolchak was a charming and witty man who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which was an old car used at the time) on his way to save the day The humanity. As good as any other fictional hero, Carl Kolchak was the hero of all the men who came alive every week for a season thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he has passed away and his show is on DVD, I hope he has fun watching him watch his fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again!
