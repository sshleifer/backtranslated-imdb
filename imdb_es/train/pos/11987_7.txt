As it has been a few years since I reviewed this classic, I decided to go back and review it more in the department, but first some notes from a film critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those that I grew up with, it made my childhood happy, it made it amazing, I missed some of these things today that we clearly do not see as much as on other days, well in the review ... <br /> <br /> Talespin, or Luftens Helte, which is called in Denmark, is a great animated series, it looks a lot like chip and dale, ducktales and many of those old ones, so it has that strange feeling that surrounds it, I can not remember this series as much as I would like to remember it. <br /> <br /> But, in my opinion, it was very good, it came with some kind of message, not so wild a message, however, it is one of the old ones so they can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I do not want to sound old or anything, but I feel that time has slipped out of my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or anything else that weird, we have all these new or almost new programs like Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel we do not have the same spirit in cartoons or in real programs as we did in the first few days. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that time has changed too much, to conclude, I would love to see these series as Talespin are thrown back to the TV screen instead of all the news . Give me back my childhood cartoons, give them to the children I have someday, give them back ...
