I just read the main comment of this movie that is on the first page with the results of the voting and the cast. <br /> <br /> Why is it that some people can not take a movie for what they are supposed to do? be. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be a little cheery, silly, a family comedy, things to make children laugh and things for adults, and that's exactly what this movie does. <br /> <br /> I burst out laughing in this movie, I thought that Carey made a great presentation and that the whole movie (if you saw her at Christmas) really gives you a bit of festive joy <br /> < So for all of you, movie critics stop sounding like movie students and play each movie because it's not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and take movies for what they're supposed to be, entertainment!
