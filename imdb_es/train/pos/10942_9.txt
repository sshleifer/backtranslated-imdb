I would give this show ten out of ten if it were not for the fart jokes. You are so sensitive that it's crazy! So quick to point out the "racism" of the show and the jokes, but they are also quick to say ridiculously sexist, a pig-headed shit like "well, duh, some of these other shows make these jokes a lot better because at least they have hot women. " Very unpleasant. The jokes about abortion are great because, really, who takes abortion seriously anyway? At least I'm not a boring * child. I heard that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman have come together to make a movie about sisters traveling together on a trip. Talk about a movie of the year!
