['Basically, the movie could be one of the most fascinating titles made by either of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let&#39;s be clear, the film deserved its exaggeration as one of the most elegant thrillers and thrillers ever made. <br /><br /> When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo. Both this movie and Deja Vu are the best thrillers you can expect. Washington really felt very comfortable with the unstable cameras and all the scenes running the film. One would easily be related to the emotions of his character, therefore, he enjoyed all the murders along the way. It&#39;s a success that they created a super-dark city of Mexico with many shits happening. One would be easily convinced by the degree of corruption represented in Man On Fire. I do not know what the Mexicans will think when they see this ... <br /><br /> Well, let&#39;s face it again. He is one of the best of the Death Wish genre, but he also suffered a lot of violence. It is a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the film very realistic and letting Denzel Washington play the kind of tragic hero of &quot;lost sheep&quot;. In the end, they even had a shot of the kidnapper in his own pool as a documentary. I was checking in IMDb if the movie was based on real events for that ... So, for your consideration, if you also find that the subject of the film is a bit fake. <br /><br /> In the end, I hope you do not take this movie for real. <br /><br /> 8/10 for art direction / editing / cinematography / Denzel Washington.']
