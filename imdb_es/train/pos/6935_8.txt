James Stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge that relates to the fate of the films, such as the Winchester Rifle. Stewart says it goes without saying that it's great to add a coldly harsh obsession to his relaxed, relaxed cowboy. The story follows the fate of a Winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man who is hunting. <br /> <br /> We find a selection of players, gun fighters, Indian merchants. and bank robbers while we follow the path of rifles through Indian battles, robberies to banks, etc. The supporting cast is solid, with Dan Durya standing out as Waco Johnny Dean, the live wire gunner with a finger on the trigger that itches. Also as a triviality note, a very early appearance of Rock Hudson as Indian chief. <br /> <br /> The final showdown is a classic in which a tense long-range rifle combat was played in and around a rocky outcrop. Add a good action from the old west, fist fights, shootings and horseback chases that make for an adventure in the west. 8/10
