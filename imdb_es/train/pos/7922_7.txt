In this post of horror films, paranoia of the Cold War of the 50s, the Reagan era in the United States and high school films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the quarterback of Full Moon High in the 1950s He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to communist Romania and one night, while he is lost in the streets, a werewolf bites him. When he returns to the United States, he can not control his animal impulses and goes on a spree. Frustrated, he flees from the city. Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to the city and re-enrolls in high school. He still can not control his transformations, and the townspeople, and his friends, realize that he is not entirely human. Everything culminates during the great soccer game of the school. <br /> <br /> I was hoping this was one of those "so bad that they're good" movies from the early 80's. But I was surprised that the movie was really, legitimately fun. The cast, including Kenneth Mars as a perverted trainer, Roz Kelly as the exuberant flame of Tony, Demond Wilson as a bus driver, and Alan Arkin as a strange doctor, do their best, with hilarious results. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I was surprised at how similar writing and humor was to "Family Guy". 'Full Moon High' has that same attitude, and never takes it seriously.
