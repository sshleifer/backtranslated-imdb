For my part, I really like this movie for some reasons I'll be late but I want to explain why I think people do not like it. First of all, there are people who simply hate Tom Cruise. I really do not understand it. Second, Cameron Crowe, I think he successfully brought up two groups of viewers with this movie. The informal, relaxed, "do not look to think too much" the group of spectators is confused when the plot takes 180 complete at the end of the film. And fans of deep and philosophical mysteries feel devastated when Crowe has one of his characters that fully explains the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a very good job on it. I think it's probably his best performance of what I've seen everything, although I have not seen all his movies, or even most of them probably. The cast is good too. Penelope Cruz gives a solid performance and Jason Lee was nice. <br /> <br /> I like history, and I think that's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything. It's a mystery, an adventure and a romantic comedy, but it's mostly just a good story. And it has many philosophical nuances, and many similar ideas and stories like this one occur in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is the man who had everything he wanted, more or less he lost it, he was given a second chance with a trap to get everything back, and in the end, facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening, choose reality, simplicity and normality to see if you can finally find the one thing you could never control yourself about: happiness. <br /> <br /> Many people were disappointed that Crowe exposed the whole mystery at the end. I think it is necessary. The public knows, without a doubt, that David is aware of his circumstances and, in the end, the choice is even more powerful. <br /> <br /> And the music in the movie is excellent. It's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is. Particularly, "Njosnavelin" by Sigur Ros, which is an incredible song. <br /> <br /> In general, I would give it 3 out of 4 stars. It is a film with some substance for those who like to analyze things, and a great story for those who seek to relax. That "moderate" approach is probably the reason why people dislike him so much because it is not a complete mystery or a full-blown love story. Mix and combine different elements and genres.
