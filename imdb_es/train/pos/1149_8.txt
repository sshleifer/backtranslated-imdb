Satire of fast and funny rhythm on that original "reality TV", the telenovela. The playwright Robert Harling's script is full of ridiculous phrases and situations. The best of them is the climax, a live transmission that deteriorates rapidly and becomes bad improvisation and a brain transplant. Keven Kline's murder of his lines, because he does not wear his glasses, is very funny. "Your brain will explore laterally in the following houses." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It's a pleasure to see a cast click like it does in this movie. This is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. Alan Silvestri's score is an added advantage. It fits the soap opera with its extravagant and melodramatic air.
