['This is simply the most amazing movie you&#39;ll ever see. I thought it was just another documentary, but it&#39;s really something else. It does not try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature. <br /><br /> I&#39;m not going to talk about the quality of the images, because obviously you know from other comments that is unparalleled. <br /><br /> The earth is fun, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and with what treasure we were blessed, but we do not appreciate it a bit. <br /><br /> This film must be compulsory in schools. It&#39;s the most wonderful movie you&#39;ll ever see, so go see it. Who knows, maybe it&#39;s the last time we can see our planet like this ... <br /><br /> 10/10, but I would easily rate it more if possible.']
