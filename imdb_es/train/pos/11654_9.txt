['I agree with the previous comment, I love realism in this, and in many movies (not only in movies about eating disorders) the producers seem to forget it. They take a problem every day and create a hugely dramatic scene and then, at the end of the movie, everything is perfect again, which I do not like because it is not reality. It does not mean that things can not improve, and it does not mean that things do not appear in this movie, but it does not mean the majority of the film creating all these problems, and at the end of the film, everything is perfect again. . When people have eating disorders, people not only admit it and want to improve, and then life is lasting, it takes time, and I like how in this movie we grow with the characters, we go through the difficulties with them, we get Better and worse, because it is a very important part of the movie. It enters the minds of people with eating disorders and shows complications and pain in a very realistic way, and I loved that. I also love how it shows The secret and the betrayal that people feel when they suffer eating disorders, it is scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve. I thought that this movie was very touching, beautiful and well told, and definitely one of my favorites.']
