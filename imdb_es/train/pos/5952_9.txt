This film is humorous, charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is not the place for serious history lessons, so I just accept it as it is. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, behaves quite well as the blacksmith Hank Martin, who by accident is transported to another era, the time of King Arthur. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is impressive as Alisande, or Sandy, the object of Hank's affections, although she is committed to the brave and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I love that episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress in tattered clothes and head out on the main road with their backpacks to experience the First hand realm. King Arthur's comment: "I say we are not alone" while we give a good scratch to his scruffy clothes, is one of those funny moments in the movie. The representation of William Bendix is ​​extraordinarily ridiculous, not to mention his attempts to make the picturesque "ye Olde English". <br /> <br /> The story is not profound, but in my opinion it is well made and I enjoy it every time I see it. It is a great family entertainment too. <br /> <br />
