['The film focuses mainly on Robert Taylor&#39;s bullying as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with it. Located in the midst of a search for a diminishing number of buffalo, it portrays the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and is filled with drama and remorse for both buffaloes and Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of the Indians and his naivet√© that buffalo herds will never disappear. In one scene, he shoots animal after animal, while in another he murders the Indians and then eats the food they had cooking in his fire. Under this ruthless exterior lies an insecure person who is forced to pray to his companions (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. It is not the most pleasant film and it is overloaded by the drama it creates, which leads to a grim and very appropriate conclusion in a blizzard.']
