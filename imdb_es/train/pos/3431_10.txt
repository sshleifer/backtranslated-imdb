Simply the best Estonian film I've seen, although it's made by a Finnish director, Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a group of gangsters who try to steal a large amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a kind of summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union fell apart and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now conditions may be better in most of those countries. But in the early 1990s, many of these new nations had to fight against the corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as an inheritance. (And many of them still do ... at least on some level ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film from that era with credible characters and a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the best-known Estonian actor, who plays Snaut in Tarkovski's Solaris), an old gangster who is slowly getting tired of his lifestyle. But the most amazing performance comes from Monika Mäger, an actress and actress who plays Terje, a child as a teenager, whose presence in the plot is quite essential. (And his name is not even mentioned in the IMDb credits list!) W <br /> <br /> There are not many movies in the world that manage to be entertaining and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does that. Unfortunately, the other Järvi-Laturi films are far from this kind of achievement. The first one, Kotia päin, was too artificial and the last, History is Made at Night, was a strange disaster.
