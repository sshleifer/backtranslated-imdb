I am watching the series back to back as fast as possible. I'm trying to see all the Star Trek stuff. This is month 3 and now I am in season 3 of TNG and I have already gone through DS9 in its entirety. Star Trek is the largest television phenomenon ever achieved. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first recap episode of the TNG series. After having watched the programs, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I noticed how a couple of them were recorded again because the movie looked better. Season 1 always seemed very dark and ugly, and the actors seemed stupid, as if they did not fit into their own skins. <br /> <br /> The show is essentially made of the biggest hits of the happiest. and the saddest moments in Riker's life in the company until now. The scene Data and Riker in the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite is when the second officer in the Klingon ship defies Riker's authority as first mate and Riker defeated that Klingon's live CRAP. Then the admiral kicks him, but hey. All this episode is a great reminder that a LOT of madness, great things have already happened in just 2 seasons with 5 more to finish and a handful of movies! At this point in the series, they are really beginning to develop the emotions that unite Riker with Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Up to this point, they have mentioned the fact, but they still have to exploit it. Let the record show that the ST Wiki - Memory Alpha states that Imzadi means "first" and denotes that he has had intimate relationships with Riker and that he also stays very close to being emotional. This episode further demonstrates that there will be a tense romantic interest for one another for a long time. <br /> <br /> Here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By At this point in the series, the production value is up to the mark and Star Trek TNG is Settling into the science fiction giant he was destined to become. Seeing this again as an adult, I see now what GREAT ACTORS the Star Trek Universe offers. They really need to make a new set of ST shows after all the current shows. A DS9 movie would have been good too.
