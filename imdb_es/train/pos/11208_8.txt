Oh, where are you going, my little one, little one ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you two, turn around and you four ... <br /> <br /> I remember these programs when you they first aired at Disneyland. I remember sitting there, electrified by the explanations of Werner Van Braune on the science of rockets. I saw how history, science and humor were woven into a fascinating history of possibilities. <br /> <br /> That was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series, and they are a treasure. I saw them last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter, who at first would not even come to the room, but then changed her mind when she saw that they were partially animated. While I watched her, I watched her and, in the end, she was almost as absorbed as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're a young wife with your own young ... <br /> <br /> Sure, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate, and the overall presentation is still impressive. I found myself thinking that my daughter's teacher might want to show them to her class, not just as a 50-year-old artifact, but also as fun, easy-to-understand lessons in the story. <br /> <br /> Turn it around, turn it around, turn around and again ... you're wondering how much it has really changed in 50 years.
