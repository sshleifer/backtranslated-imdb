Let's start with the song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you get caught between the moon and the city of New York". It's a great song and a song, even after all these years, it never tires. It really is a great song about New York City as well. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore CBE stars as a pampered drunk millionaire who is committed to the character of Jill Eikenberry in the movie. Jill would later star in LA Law. Anyway, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won an Academy Award for his performance in the film as Best Supporting Actor. Arthur falls in love with the character of Liza Minnelli, who is perfect in this film, as well as her performance in her Oscar-winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza does not sing. She plays a waitress. Anyway, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the Bach matriarch of the family who decides the family fortune. Anyway, she is fabulous and should have obtained a nomination to the awards of the academy for the best supporting actress. Barney Martin, better known as Jerry's father in Seinfeld, plays Liza's father. He is great too. The film was well written, performed and delivered to the audience that wanted more of it.
