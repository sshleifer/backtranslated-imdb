Three sergeants in the British army stationed in India, are sent to stop an uprising of a tribe of murderers known as the Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, moves away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the thuggees led by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, the water boy of the regiment, returns to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him, but they are also captured. Now the commander sends a complete detail after all three, but he does not realize that they are walking in a trap set by the Thugees. However, it is Gunga Din who saves the day. Excellent friends movie, although today is politically incorrect. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give very good humorous and exciting performances with Jaffe very well in the main role and Cianelli very sinister as Guru. Score- 10 out of 10.
