Orson Welles manages to hit me in the ass with every picture of him I see. Lady of Shanghai is at the same level as her other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial and Chimes at Midnight. The plot can be confusing at times, and sometimes it seems that it is moving perhaps a bit too fast (approximately one hour was edited when the detection tests were deficient). However, it does not matter. You can not watch Welles movies and concentrate too much on the plot. Your address defines what a great address it is. Almost any scene in this movie can be compatible with any other scene he directed. Take a look at the scene in the audience room. In general, they are so common scenes that I can not stand them. Case in point, try to sit through Welles's own speech near the end of the compulsion. In Lady from Shanghai, only pay attention to the level of detail in the scene of the room. Watch the jury that always sneezes and interrupts procedures. Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene. I know, it's just a simple Venetian blind, and it was used constantly in the movies and crime of the time, but Welles gives it a beauty of its own. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the ability, a skill no one else seemed to have, to make a crime movie that contained examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he was talking Shakespeare or spitting hard lines, he had the power to stir the soul. 10/10.
