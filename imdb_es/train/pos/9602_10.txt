Darius Goes West is a film that shows the American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful movie full of fun and sometimes heartbreaking shows a young man who never waited, but longed to see, what was outside the limits of his charming city of Athens, GA. Dar√≠o wanted to see the ocean. His old friends Logan, Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius's wish come true. They started little by little: Ben & Logan's mother started an email campaign to raise awareness about Darius's condition: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise funds for the boys to take Darius not only to see the ocean but to these Great United States. To say that the young friends of the university managed to bring hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They realized the dream of Darius and then some. They put their lives on hold while showing Darius love, care and lots of fun while helping Darius see how he can, in turn, show those same traits to others who suffer from DMD. Darius volunteered for the Red Cross, sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his friends) outside of a local grocery store. Her wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true; all you need is hope and a group of friends from the university to support and take care of you. Give Oscar to Darius and everyone else, nobody else deserves it. Martha Sweeney
