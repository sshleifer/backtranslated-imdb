Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer against Kramer combined with the imagination of Pan's Labyrinth. Even the beginning of the special effect seems to give a nod to Pan Labyrinth. But this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in a war of sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today. Jake's Closet is about a child, an only child, practically only on summer vacations, who tries to make his family fall apart. It's a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense, a horror movie for the person who thinks. If you are looking for a slasher movie, this will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for a moving and suspenseful story with good acting, this is the movie for you. In the screening I saw, I swear there was a moment when the whole audience shouted. I highly recommend capturing this movie.
