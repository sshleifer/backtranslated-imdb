['This is one of the best Finnish films of this year, although Tango Kabaree is close. The director Lampela made a few years ago another cute little movie called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista (she was in love with a desperate woman). Joki is truly faithful to the beautiful movie life of a Saturday afternoon in a small town / city. The actors may not be so handsome or beautiful, but they act very well. I certainly hope that many of them will get the JUSSI statue (Finnish OSCAR) next spring. I think this movie could do it also abroad.']
