For all who expect a traditional superhero movie, it can be an unpleasant surprise. It is definitely more a drama than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and is a bit like a Greek tragedy; whatever the main character does always goes wrong in some way. <br /> <br /> That's because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law into his own hands and society does not appreciate it. Sasha becomes an outlaw. While he flees, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love, so things get even more complicated. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic, but the movie lacks dynamics. It reminds me a bit of the narration in the recent films of Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there is an action scene, it becomes so immensely dynamic that before you realize what is happening, everything is over. But the director does not want to impress us with a striking and striking action. What is most important here is the result of Sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. The score is very low, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. Basically, you must be very patient to see it. <br /> <br /> Is it worth the movie? That is a really difficult question to answer. I do not think this experience has enriched me so much, but somehow I still think about this film and I want to see it again. Mainly due to the atmosphere, which is very dense, but not stifling because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope. After all, they are young, they have all their lives to live. So no matter how hard it is, there is always a cheerful tone when you are together.
