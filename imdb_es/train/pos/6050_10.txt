In the end! A decent British comedy that does not focus on some fake bank robbers or is cut from a television series. John Ivay's film is a story of psychoactive discovery, dressed in motorcycle clothing. The three protagonists are soft fools with a penchant for failure and each at a decisive moment in their lives, providing a sensitive and emotional trio of subplots to unite the unbridled comedy. The chemistry between the three friends is palpable and makes it a moving company with fun dialogues and some classic comic moments. He feels part of Withnail and I, part of the American werewolf in London and part of the cuadrafenia (but only because of the bike gangs, and Phil Daniels). In fact, the adorable rogue Phil Daniels reminds Danny, the merchant in Withnail and I, with his academic focus and his scientific commitment to drugs. This is a great movie, especially for those who have dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past, which will relate to many moments of the film. A personal favorite is the bright scene at the corner shop in Wales, buying snacks while stumbling over 'mushrooms'. This soft comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and make you laugh out loud. And you do not have to ride a bicycle or even like to enjoy it. But it will be added to it if you do it. Sparkly.
