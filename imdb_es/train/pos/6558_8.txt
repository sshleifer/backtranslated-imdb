I do not agree with the previous comment about this movie. I think it was cute and fun and it conveyed a good message for the girls as my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap whore to be cool. You can be smart, beautiful and classy at the same time. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and that the story was good for the target audience. In general, my wife, my daughter (10) and I thought it was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. She has also encouraged my daughter to start reading the original mysteries of Nancy Drew, which I am sure she will love as much as the Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to get him to sleep tonight because he wanted to start reading immediately. I can not think of a better result for that movie than to rekindle interest in that classic series.
