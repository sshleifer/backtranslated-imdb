As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I just watched the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the film without being contaminated by what was or was not in the musical (however, it contaminated me when I saw the musical :)) <br /> <br /> Actually I think Michael Douglas worked quite well In that role, together with Kasey. I think his 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and the singing in the film are far superior to the musical, as well as the cast that is at least 10 times larger (easier to make in the movie, of course). The decoration, the lighting, the dancing and the singing are also very superior in the film, what should be expected and, in fact, handed over. <br /> <br /> The songs that were in common with the musical are best done in the movie, the new ones are pretty good, and the whole movie simply offers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a Musical that has few decorations. The only negative point of the film are the obvious cuts between the talking actors and the singers dubbed during the singing parts of some of the characters, but their dance is impeccable and the final product was more enjoyable than the musical.
