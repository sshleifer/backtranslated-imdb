['I have seen The Blob several times and it is one of the best low budget alien invasion films of the 1950s. <br /><br /> A strange meteor lands on the outskirts of a small town and an old man will investigate this. A strange gelatinous substance clings to one of his arms and to a young couple who saw the land of the meteor arrive and took it to the local doctor, where the old man is completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is growing. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe in the young couple and accuse them of inventing all this. Finally they believe them when the mass, now huge, appears in the cinema of the city and everyone runs to the street screaming. Then he adheres to a dinner with the young couple and some others inside. The Blob stops spraying a load of fire extinguishers and freezes, which is his weakness. It is then transported by air to frozen Arctic waste and disposed of there. But it&#39;s just frozen, not dead ... <br /><br /> This film has a typical scenario for its time: teenagers and a small city. The Blob has a good rock and roll style song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric at all times. <br /><br /> The sequel, be careful! The Blob followed in 1972 and a new version came in 1988, but this is the best of the Blob movies. <br /><br /> The cast is directed by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is the movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I&#39;m not familiar with any of the other stars. <br /><br /> The Blob is a must see for all science fiction fans. Fantastic. <br /><br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.']
