To have a friend who is currently involved in a relationship with a SOB who has a long-term girlfriend. Of course, the SOB is very handsome, charming, etc. and my friend is a very intelligent woman. Seeing the character of Jean Pierre Leaud at work is exactly like seeing what happens in real life when people like that destroy the lives of our friends. It's tragic, and you know it's going to end up very hurt, but there's nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Totally empty Leaving blank all the time, pull out the faces and tell the stories you think will have the reaction you want. <br /> <br /> The two-hour scene in which Leaud and Lebrun have made love, and the next morning he puts on a Record and, with much sweetness and charm, singing to amuse her is great. The expression "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot?" That blinking on his face will remain in my memory for a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but look at it. In one go, preferably in a cinema. It takes a while to get in, but then time simply disappears.
