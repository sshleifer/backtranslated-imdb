I was attracted to DAN IN REAL LIFE for the excellent reviews and thirst for a Dramedy that was well written, thanks to Peter Hedges, and because when Steve Carell stars in the film, you know that an audience is going to be like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE , a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding. DAN IN REAL LIFE fulfilled that promise. <br /> <br /> The film is so real to many families around the world who have lost a member and are still going about their lives in search of something that gives them back magic. before his loss. With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so well done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and their travels. The cast, sets and history made DAN IN REAL LIFE an unforgettable moment as we approach the next vacation.
