['I am totally addicted to this show. I can not wait until the next week to see the next concert. It&#39;s a great story and it has the best actors and actresses in the program. I&#39;ll tune in every week to see it, even if I&#39;m not at home, I always have my vcr configured to record the monarch&#39;s cove. Simon Rex is the best actor in the show. It&#39;s suspense and exciting. I think this program should stay on the air and I think everyone should tune in to see it. I saw the first episode and I was not really going to see it, but one day I was watching life and I decided to watch it because it was on and I love it and right now it&#39;s my favorite show. I really mean it.']
