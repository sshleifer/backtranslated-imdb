['This is a good surprise; It is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but tight, competent and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea developed in a convincing 90 minute script. <br /><br /> The configuration does not require bells and whistles, a long exposure or a background story; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German business woman who lives in London, drifts while waiting for the last subway train. She wakes up to find the deserted place, but quickly realizes that she is far from being alone. Someone, or something, is there with her and her intentions are completely malicious. <br /><br /> In fact, he meets several other characters in his quest to survive, including a lustful co-worker, a homeless couple and a caged sewer worker, all of whom add rhythm and substance to the plot. There&#39;s a slightly uncomfortable gear shift somewhere in the middle of the movie when the tension thriller mutates to gore fest, but nothing so clumsy as to slow the hectic pace. For those of you with weak dispositions this is likely to be a heartbreaking trip; For those of you who enjoy some well-executed carnal chaos this should press all the correct buttons. <br /><br /> The climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film, but it is peppered with a pleasant moment of unexpected social comment that provides a satisfying conclusion. <br /><br /> Some may feel cheated by a clear explanation of the exact nature and history of the threat that Kate and her colleagues faced, however, for me this was not the case. A horror movie writer should not feel compelled to splatter every i and cross every t, in the same way that a writer of political suspense is expected. There are enough clues here to give you a very clear idea of what brought this evil into existence, making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous. The retention of a certain sense of mystery is welcome and reminds us that in this film the trip will always be more important than the exact destination. <br /><br /> I understand that the budget for this film was, to say the least, minimal, in which case our applause for this British horror should be much higher, since at no time do you have the impression that corners are cut or that the effects do not work deliver. <br /><br /> If this sounds like your kind of movie, then it probably is. Buy a ticket and get on board.']
