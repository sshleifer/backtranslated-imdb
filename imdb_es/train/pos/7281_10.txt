The first time I saw this movie in a local station was in the horror show on Sunday afternoon, around 1969 or 1970. No cuts. I was just a little boy at the time, but I loved it and I really was not so scared by that. I thought I had such a great and very original story. Thinking about that, I'm still surprised that he saw himself during the day on television without cuts in those years. I have searched for this film since then, I have seen it again and again and I have always loved it. One would think that John Waters would have idolized this movie. It has to be not just a scary movie, but one of the most sordid and evil films ever made at that time. And, surprisingly, you do not hear that this has the cult as a result of a movie like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" that has been acquired over the years. It has a cult following, but it should have become a cult classic, in my opinion. As far as I know, this came out a bit before Blood Feast came out, which is probably one of the first real "gore" movies. In fact, this movie has elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis and a small Russ Meyer included. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend it to anyone who likes the trashy, sleazy, black and white horror movies of the early 60s (I think the date at the end of it said 1960).
