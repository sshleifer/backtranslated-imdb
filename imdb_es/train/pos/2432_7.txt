I remember Casper's comics, but I do not remember any caricature. Maybe they were not memorable; I do not know, but at my old age, here I am watching this short animation by Casper very early yesterday. Afterwards, I was surprised to read the comments of the users here. Did the people miss the end? <br /> <br /> I have to learn again that Casper is not like the other ghosts, who like to go out every night and scare everyone else. "He does not see future in that," according to the narrator here. Instead, one night he goes out to the rural section of the city, without realizing it, scares some animals and can not find friends. It makes him cry, until a little fox hears him cry and befriends him. The two become friends, but soon, the fox runs for his life with a fox hunt in progress. <br /> <br /> Other reviews have mentioned what happens, so I'll also talk about that. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown) and Casper is crying for losing "the only friend I've ever had". But, nobody mentions the happy ending of this story. "Ferdie", the fox becomes a spiritual figure like Casper, jumps on his lap, lays down and the narrator comments that "they lived happily ever after". Both characters look full of joy. <br /> <br /> What's so sad about that? This is a good story with a nice and happy ending.
