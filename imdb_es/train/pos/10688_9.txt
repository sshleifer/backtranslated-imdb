I really did not know what to expect when I went out to see the film, apart from the basic plot, something surreal, that a lone man orders a Russian bride through the Internet. That and I had Nicole Kidman in it. However, I loved the movie and went out thinking "wow". <br /> <br /> Refreshing on earth, the film is moving very well, with some surprises on every corner. The relationships in the film are believable, with Nicole and Chaplin working beautifully with each other. The humor is subtle, with some great scenes of 'Office' in the bank, and the element of suspense adds tension without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is about real people in an unusual situation. It is less about heroism and more about delicate relationships. Brit-filmmaking at its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
