Threatened with the danger of losing the opulent family home, Big Sister makes a great sacrifice and secretly marries a real estate developer so he can inherit his ... her aunt's fortune. A few years later, she learns that he is behind the family farm and wants to tear it down, so she leaves him and tries to stop him. She spends more time and the husband ends up taking her to court when he finds out that she has given him a son without telling him.
