I have to be honest, I expected such a big failure, because it really sounded like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money. But that was not the case with this rather funny movie (sometimes weird). I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with Simba and he who had trouble sleeping was fun. The bubble of the jacuzzi, and when Pumbaa leaves, the bubbles stop. Everything is harmless fun, good for children and some adults. I think this movie will last a while because it's pretty good for a direct movie to video and DVD. While the film seems a bit strange and a kind of path towards the end, it works. 8 out of 10
