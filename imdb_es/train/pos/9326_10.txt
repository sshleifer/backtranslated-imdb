I have to be honest and say that I bought this movie, not because of the content, but because David Cubitt is in it; I know ... superficial, or what? - But, come on, Mr. Cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> I really did not know what to expect from watching this movie, I read the other written article, and those elsewhere, but I have to say that I was attracted to the world of the brothers almost from the beginning. David Cubitt as Theo and Colm Feore as Ryan are as believable as the two separated brothers, the movie moves through their relationship as they try to meet each other again after the death of their parents. The scene in which Theo discovers that Ryan is gay played brilliantly, literally enters a scene and tries to leave without Ryan noticing, which, of course, he has. <br /> <br /> The movie has been very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad, moving, uplifting and a celebration of life in parts. I left this feeling of sadness for what happened Ryan, but also knowing that Theo's ex-brother, the drug addict, gave him hope and unconditional love. I agree with the other critic who finds the scene in which Theo says he will be a touching father, and I would like to say a little more. In fact, I voiced my thoughts to Ryan when he cruelly tells Theo "What makes you think you can be a father" and Theo says simply "you." Theo walks away then, but that little dialogue exchange speaks for itself just the almost self-pitying aspect of Ryan, who is brought up abruptly by the simple answer. <br /> <br /> A film brilliantly conceived in all aspects, acting, directing, writing, etc. are very well done. I really can not find anything else to say about this film, except to say that it is very difficult to deal with the death of a loved one, but this is done in an excellent way, to the infinite degree.The respect for the subject and the spilling of love (without being penitent and petty) speaks a lot in this rather selfish world we live in today Well done to all concerned. <br /> <br /> Not many films make me cry and give me a break to think about life in general, and also to rejoice for all the things that I have and not be sad about things. I did not do it, but this movie did it, it was incredibly edifying considering the subject.
