I just can not believe that these games can improve a lot, but they do. Unfortunately, I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but although I got over it, I can not wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games that I must possess, even if I have beaten them many times. I hope you never stop doing this kind of game, even if the series comes to an end. <br /> <br />
