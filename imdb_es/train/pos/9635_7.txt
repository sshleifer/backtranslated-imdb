['The romance of the film, which is also its main theme, is good and well presented. However, the environment of the love story is too lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. Worse, the psychology of the main character is strange and incomprehensible, exactly like the end of the movie. Do not hesitate to see this movie, if it caught your attention, but do not expect too much either.']
