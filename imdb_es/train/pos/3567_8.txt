The world of Times Square of Damon Runyon, in New York, before its Disneyification, is the basis of this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a man who knew about movies, directed this nostalgic tribute to the "crossroads of the world" that shows us the lower part of New York of the past. The music of Frank Loesser sounds great. We see a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area. People in the limits of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights, the action, the possibilities in that part of the city. This lower part of the city earned a living from street life that was so intense. <br /> <br /> Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film. We do not know if this makes sense, but it's not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage. That original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye, and we asked ourselves about the decision not to let Robert Alda, Sam Levene, Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles. These were distinguished actors who could have made an incredible contribution. <br /> <br /> The movie, visually, is incredible. The look closely follows the fashions of the times. As for the casting of Marlon Brando, otherwise not known for his skills as a singer, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons, they seem to work on the film. Sky Masterson is, after all, a man of man, who would look otherwise queer if he presented a different 'look'. Frank Sinatra is as good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, like Sarah Brown, does a good job of portraying the Salvation Army woman who suddenly finds satisfaction with the same kind of man she is trying to save. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is a delight. She never ceases to be surprised as Miss Adelaide, a woman with a golden heart whose love interest is Nathan Detroit. Mrs. Blaine leaves a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she stops being. Stubby Kaye does a wonderful job of repeating her Nicely Nicely Johnson. <br /> <br /> The wonderful production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows, who made the adaptation to the screen. Irene Sharaff's costumes set the right tone.
