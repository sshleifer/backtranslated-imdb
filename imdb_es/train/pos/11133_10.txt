Although I love this movie, I can barely see it, it's very real. So, I put it on tonight and hid behind my computer bank. I remembered it vividly, but I just wanted to see if I could find something I had not seen before ........ I did not: that's because it's very real to me. <br /> <br /> Another "user" wrote the ages of the commentators that should be shown with their summary. I'm all for that! It is absolutely obvious that most of these people who have commented on "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born when it was released. They are mentioning other movies in which Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared at a later time. I will be just as frankly frank: I am 82 years old. If you are familiar with some of my other comments, you will be aware that I was a professional impersonator for 60 of those years, and I have also appeared in a movie, you would never recognize me, even if you were familiar. With my nightclub character. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this movie? I bet that I DO! .... <br /> <br /> .... and I'm not at all ashamed. If you have not met any of them, it is your loss, but you have many possibilities, but I did not know it. Many mothers, fathers, sons and daughters may surprise you. It should not be secret. MANY actors / actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of "Midnight Cowboy". Who is the judge? I can name several current BIG-TIME stars that grew up in the sordid streets of many cities and did not suffer the least damage from the time they spent there. I do not judge, because they are human beings, as we all are: love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you name the attributes, they are all there, no matter how the package looks. <br /> <br /> The "triviality" about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could play the role of "Ratzo" is a gem: he can be seen driving his car all over Los Angeles. How do you think you get your opinion? ? I can also name many male stars who stood on the streets and toured bars for money. Although the nightclub where I worked last for 26 years was famous and world-famous, I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased down our high street, looking for a pick-up. <br /> <br /> This should not be a surprise today, although it is definitely action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake up and smell the roses. They do not smell less sweet because they are of a different tone. <br /> <br /> Some of the "users" thought that "Joe Buck" had been bothered by his grandmother. Although I saw him in his bed with a boyfriend, I did not find any incidence of that. Believe it or not, children have ALWAYS not had their own rooms, since it is an obligation today that should tell you that something perverted may be happening in the main room. Whose business? Hoffman may have asked for a change in the streets, but some of the "users" point out that Jon Voight was not an important star for the shooting of "Midnight Cowboy"; his real salary would surprise him. I think they robbed him! No one can doubt the clarity he put in his paper, or that he has become a star for a job as important as "Deliverance". He defined a powerful man who had conquered his demons and it was better because of that: few people commented that he had been sodomized in this movie. The end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but society has always been modern. <br /> <br /> I also did not find any homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe"; They were clearly opposed, unattractive to each other. They found a much purer relationship: true friendship. If you did not understand that at the end of the movie, then you've wasted your time. The bewilderment of "Joe", but the devotion without shame was evident. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role, one that John Wayne could never achieve, and he was so handsome in his youth. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman: you wait for fireworks. He gave them magnificently. Wayne got his Oscar. All the characters in this movie were beautifully defined: if you do not think they still exist, you're wrong. "Party" ? - Attend some of the "raves" that young people attend ... if you can enter. Look at the lines of people trying to enter fashion clubs. You will see every scandalous personality. <br /> <br /> Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of the elegant women of society who sometimes have to get to the heart of the matter. If you were surprised by her brilliant performance, thinking "this is not real", look at the "ladies" of today who live on the edge of bad reputation ... and are admired for it. <br /> <br /> The brutality "Joe" shown in the elder's theft, unfortunately, is also part of life. You do not have to forgive it, but it is not very different from any violence. "Joe" purposefully named his purpose: in that situation, he would have delivered the money faster than he had requested. That is one of the scenes that makes this film a breakthrough, one that I do not see. I have a broken heart for both ... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger must certainly have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chilling and beautiful eye opener. Waldo Salt did not write from clairvoyance. Anyone who has participated in the presentation of the screen must have realized that they were making history and being proud of their honesty. Maybe "only in the United States" we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other filmmakers do not take the trouble to present it to the public. Not looking does not mean it is not there, give me the truth every time. Bravo! to all......
