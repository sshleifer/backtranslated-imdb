Dick Tracy is easily the best comic-based movie made to date. The film has the same feel as comics, staying true to the color combination. The Batman series has climbed, fallen, climbed and fallen again. Dick Tracy has a real power of permanence as something that adults and children can enjoy. The good triumph over evil, without blood and gore to convey the message. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best work by far is Warren Beatty, who simply personifies Dick Tracy, just as he did with Clyde Barrows. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is running out.
