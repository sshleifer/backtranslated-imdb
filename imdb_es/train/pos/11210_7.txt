Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was a very lucky lady many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had a lot of extracurricular money. His passion was animals and he dedicated himself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones in the lands of his property. Trudy also raised two chimpanzees in her house to make them look more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day, she finds out about an abandoned baby gorilla. Not knowing anything about the great apes, she relies on her husband's medical skills and expert advice to save the life of the gorilla. Once out of danger, Trudy decides that she will raise the gorilla, too, as one of her children. This works well for years and Buddy, the gorilla, is truly an extraordinarily intelligent addition to his home. But, Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. Can Trudy keep Buddy under control? For animal lovers, Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and history. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanic, in the movie, but he's very close to appearing totally real. Russo gives a good performance as a lady before her time and support players are also quite nice. The costumes are exemplary, as befits the previous era of history, and outstanding configuration and production values. But, most importantly, the animals are here in abundance, not only Buddy, but also the adorable chimps, ducks, rabbits and so on. For those who want to see a movie and be transported to the animal heaven, here on earth, this is a great movie option. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to see a great family movie, will be "simulated" by Buddy.
