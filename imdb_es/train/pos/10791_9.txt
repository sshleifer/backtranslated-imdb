A true hero of modern times, Chuck Norris has left the television "Walker, Rexas Ranger", and is looking for new steps for his artistic career. The president's man is the second film of a future television series, with Norris in the lead role, and with young actors like Jennifer Tung or Judson Mills (one of the young "Walker" rangers). The old teacher teaches the young aspirant. It is one of the most powerful themes of "The President's Man". In this time, "A line in the sand" has reached the worldwide surprise for its treatment of terrorism in the United States, months before the tragic September 11. Eric Norris, Chuck's son, is the director. The film is fun, a good action work, many fights and heroism. Chuck Norris has many plans for the future. Bells of innocence, his next picture, will be next. <br /> <br />
