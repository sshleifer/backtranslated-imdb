All the action taken in the first season has been really incredible. The first glimpse you get of Max and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or, as I like to call them minis. The minis do the best acting work I've seen children do. The main actors and actresses, that is, Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly, etc., make you forget that you are watching a t.v. They show that they seem to make this show come alive. In short, this is the best show I've seen in my life.
