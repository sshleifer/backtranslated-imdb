Riget II is a good sequel, but not as good as the first one. This series does not seem to be as serious as the first one. There's a lot more comedy in this, well, though. <br /> <br /> We are back in the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish National Hospital. Mrs. Drusse is about to leave the hospital while her work is being done, but destiny wants it to be otherwise. She is soon chasing ghosts and Helmer is driving everyone crazy and will soon get worse as the black powers in the Kingdom unleash. <br /> <br /> This story involves much more comedy than the previous one. Of course, a lot of fun, but it makes you take the series a little less serious. The story has saved many elements of the last series and has added some new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are a bit silly, but they keep doing it more like a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast. They are all very good. It's a strange story and setting. Some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show, so keeping it serious and keeping it real is not an easy task. However, these actors handle this situation perfectly. <br /> <br /> Many of the good qualities of the first series remain intact. Cinematography is one of those qualities. The handheld camera that made Trier famous gives fame and suspense to the series. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and Trier makes use of these skills. The good, the movement, the great lighting and the good composition and editing make it pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> Get ready to see a better effect in this sequel than in the first one. Also prepare to see a little more. I did not think that green thing looked very good. I thought it was unoriginal and it did not fit. However, effects like ghosts are really good. Non-digital effects also look good. The little Brother seems really strange, but you accept it. Everywhere I would say that the effects are from OK to good. <br /> <br /> The music is also pretty good. Moody and nice. Some of them are really touching. It fits very well. Like the first one there is quite a bit of music in the action scenes and it works very well. <br /> <br /> Altogether, this makes a good sequel. If you have seen Riget, you can see this without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend watching the first series before seeing this. These two form a series that you do not want to miss.
