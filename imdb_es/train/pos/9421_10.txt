It contains * spoilers * - also, my appointments may not be exact. <br /> <br /> Everyone always observes the satire in the social commentaries and the economic parallels, what truth. But for me, I see this movie as much more than that. I love the symbolism of this guy in a bright white suit. There is so much confusion and filth in the world that surrounds it, but it will not hold. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play this; His childish smiles and his eternal curiosity are very appropriate: <br /> <br /> "That's clever, can you tell me what the ratio of ink and gasoline is?" <Br /> <br /> The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention has not worked after all: there almost naked. However, more than embarrassment is the simple disappointment that "it did not work". He is never really intimidated by people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we also want to stop him." <br /> <br /> Just a moment of hesitation before he tries to escape again. Does it show any sign of the pain that such betrayal must have caused? No. <br /> <br /> The role of Dapne is also remarkable. She is sick and tired of money and power. She believes that she has finally found love, outside of her father's company. At first, she really does not care more about Sidney than anyone. But at that moment, when he falls out of the car and she comes back to see if maybe he killed him, and still just think about the beauty of his invention. She has finally found something for what she believes is worth living. The funny thing is that it's not even romance. It is a friendship, but of such ephemeral nature that the title almost does not fit. It's more admiration, and maybe even inspiration. <br /> <br /> Upon discovering that Michael does not have a true love for her, and that his father is completely incompetent to take care of her, she indulges in cynicism and tries to tempt her. Sidney Fortunately, she finds that there are really people in this world who live for more than power, money and lust. What a soda: <br /> <br /> "Thanks, Sidney, if you had said 'yes', I think I would have strangled you." <br /> <br /> I love the end, when all this crazy business seems to have come to nothing. But then, the bubbly and bizarre rhythm begins and Sidney leaves, her step coincides with the melody: bold. Where is Daphne? We really do not know, but they were not really in love and she was not really a scientist. She got help to escape and she was "shot in the arm of hope". (Pollyanna) A continuous relationship would have been good, but as Billy Joel says "it's more than I expected ..." <br /> <br />
