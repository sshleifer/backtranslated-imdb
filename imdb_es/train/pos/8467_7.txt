I liked this movie because basically it did more with less. It could have been made more interesting if they had kept it limited to study even more (although some of the elements of the plot would have been more difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The guy who plays the DJ did a good job of showing someone scared and tormented by their memories. I also found his dialogue with the people they called quite funny. <br /> <br /> While you see parts of the film looming a mile away, other parts that you do not expect will turn out the way they did. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part, concentrated more on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were pretty good since everything was revealed. <br /> <br /> While it was a shorter film, it was considered to be the right amount of time to tell the story. A little more and I would have started to drag.
