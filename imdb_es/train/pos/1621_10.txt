Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is a true masterpiece of the art of animation. The consummate skill and art that characterize this work of duos are nowhere to be found in evidence other than in this caricature. It's a pity that so many people can only see the offense in what it is, and it was always intended to be, a piece of joyful entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate blacks. In any case, it is a tribute to the infectious humor and the musicality of the black race. I have not been able to see this confection for many years as the 'commissaries of the race' in England have considered it too offensive to be shown in racial Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would love to see this masterpiece again. I think those who regularly seek messages and intentions that were never intended in these cartoons, which have, after all, sixty years, should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today, but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what can be seen from the past.
