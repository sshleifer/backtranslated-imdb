Sometimes, Lady Luck smiles at me. Originally I had made, and copied, a VHS tape of this wonderful TV presentation. I broke my heart when I realized what I had done since I had not been able to get a copy anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Recently, I subscribed to a digital cable and, while I was looking for the next films, there was my surprise. The surprise was a programmed broadcast of the movie. This time, however, I made a copy on DVD so that there is no possibility of repeating my error. <br /> <br /> I was finally able to see it again after eight years, and it was as exciting and tense as when I first saw it. There is a bit of a prelude to this story in that my first contact with "El reloj de Pandora" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. I just tuned in the station on my way home for lunch, and from the first delivery, I was hooked. Every day, I waited in advance for the next chapter to be read. <br /> <br /> When I found out, a few months later, that the book was going to be broadcast on television like a movie, I made sure to erase my calendar of that event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the film was very faithful to the book, contrary to what another critic said. That, in itself, is a rare achievement for television movies. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. I could not imagine a better option for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could have crashed and burned without an adequate cast for this pivotal role. Anderson has never been better, and it's a shame we have not seen more of him. In fact, all the cast members did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film, and the book, was the interjection of the "terrorist plan" to put together a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and they have their pilot stem and shoot down the hit plane. Basically, we are talking about less than 36 hours to organize and execute a plan like this, and friends, that is not realistic at all, given to all the players involved. Nor was it realistic how little the plane was affected by having one first, then two of its engines turned off. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I enjoyed the suspense of the building and it seemed very credible to me how they reacted. The foreign governments were represented in the film, as well as in ours. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it by all means.
