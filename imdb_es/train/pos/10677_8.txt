This film was the first British film for teenagers that addresses the reality of the violent society of rock and roll, instead of being a lucid parody of adolescent life of 1950. In an attempt to celebrate the work of the junior liaison officers of Liverpool, the opening title indicates that 92% of potential criminals, who have been treated under this scheme, have not committed a second crime. However, this becomes a mere pretext for the following teen drama until the epilogue of the film in which we are told that we should not feel responsible or sorry for such criminals however confusing they may seem. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly assumes the position of Youth Liaison Officer. This tough character is a typical Baker role. Having been in the path of a famous arsonist known as the firefly and does not enjoy the distraction of the transfer. However, as in all good police dramas, a remarkable turn of events takes him back to his original research. <br /> <br /> His first case takes him to the home of two young children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (played by a duo of real-life siblings), who has committed a small robbery. Here he meets Cathie (played satisfactorily by Anne Heywood) his older sister with whom he eventually becomes romantically involved. It quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of these farms in the center of the city is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency. <br /> <br /> The older brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the leader of a rock and roll band. Bullies McCallum makes a striking turn as the Americanized mixed guy, who owes more to the likes of Marlon Brando, than any previous British star. One remembers Brando's character, Johnny, from "The Wild One," who led a rebellious motorcycle gang with his leather clothes in the same way that "Johnny" in this film directs his band. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the preaching of Dearden's previous crime dramas like 'The Blue Lamp' are not so apparent. Instead, we are presented with several well-crafted characters on both sides of the law, as the drama of the criminals and the romantic interest between Heywood and Baker takes the lead. <br /> <br /> The plot, although sometimes predictable, delivers some memorable scenes. Disruptive influence was believed to have rock and roll music unfolds in a scene where Johnny abandons himself to the music, leading to a threatening advance on police Sgt. However, the most moving and memorable film is the climactic scene in the classroom where a group of terrified children, as Mary and Patrick, are kidnapped at gunpoint by Johnny. Obviously, in light of the massacre of Dumblaine in real life, this scene seems so horrible. It is understandable that because of this, the film is rarely broadcast or available to the modern public.
