This has to be one of my favorite movies, unlike the weak 'Elvira's Haunted Hills' ... anyway I love the way the movie is a gothic story / com 'Wizard of Oz' ... <br /> <br /> Elvira is a goth Dorothy who is stranded in an unknown city after the death of a Good Witch (aunt Morgana de elviras) ... she inherits a "Ruby" ring that is extremely powerful and wanted by the Bad Witch (His uncle). .. She befriends four characters who, unintentionally, help to grow throughout the film all the time with a dog in tow. There is a show with her uncle (the wicked witch of the west) where Elvira realizes that she has the strength inside her and ends up defeating him. In the end, the townspeople fire her after conquering their hearts and finally arrive at her destination in Las Vegas (Dorothy's house in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to the Wizard of Oz around the world. The movie ... she and her uncle, both cite relevant lines for their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Auntie Em, and you must be Uncle Remus ... There's no place like home, there's no place like home!" Bad uncle Vinny: "I'll get you my pretty and your little dog too!" <br /> <br /> There is a sign that Elvira passes when she is the first on her road trip mentioning the state of Kansas. <Br /> <br /> But apart from this, the fact that one of the sequences that "started, uh ... I mean it was inspired by FlashDance" is a pure genius ... and if you do not laugh your tit spinning at the end of his "very 80" Las Vegas show, then you do not have a camping bone in your body ... This movie is a cult / camp classic
