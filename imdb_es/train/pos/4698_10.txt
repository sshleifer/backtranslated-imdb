['Like wine, &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; improves and improves with each day. This clever, ingenious and well-acted movie could stand on its own, but as a parody of the gangster genre, it&#39;s really exceptional. In fact, it is obviously the best movie of its kind ... the funniest parody of mafia movies and even the respective period, although it is true that this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are primitive pseudo-comedies, vulgar and boring like &quot;Jane Austen&#39;s mafia&quot;.']
