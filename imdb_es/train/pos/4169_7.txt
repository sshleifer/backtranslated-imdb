Yes, it was a little low budget, but this movie shows love! The only bad thing is that you can say that the budget of this film would not be compared with "Waterworld" and, although the plot was good, the film never took advantage of its full potential! The good results of all and the suspense make it worthwhile to see them on a rainy night.
