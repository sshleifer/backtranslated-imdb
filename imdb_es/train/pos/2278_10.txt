Mother's Night is one of my favorite novels and, to see this, I expected great disappointment. Instead, I got a film that perfectly portrays the irony, humor, elegance and, above all, the crushing sadness of Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the best interpretation of Nolte to date. Capture the defeat and self-esteem of Howard Cambell Jr., from the subtle intonations of his speech to the tears contained behind his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious like George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is obsessed with her departure from reality as Cambell's young lover. John Goodman is sober and more than effective as "Blue Fairy Godmother" by Cambell. <br /> <br /> This pinnocioesca history of Cambell that tries to be its own ideal hero and that, without knowing it, becomes its ideal tragic vil√≥n is a mature and vivid look. What we are as people. And aside from that, it's one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. Cambell is the embodiment of foolish and wise love. And in the film, which is a painfully painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy when his Fairy Godmother Blue grants his wish. And he realizes that ... well, look at the movie and you'll see it. <br /> <br /> Mother Night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best movies ever made. It is a beautiful poetic story that deepens our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
