I name this and BABYLON 5 as the best science fiction television series ever made. Both stand out in my mind because, unlike the STAR TREK series, there is a constant evolution of the plots and the characters. If you watch the original STAR TREK and the STAR TREK: TNG, they were good shows, but there was not a general theme or a plot that would connect all the episodes. In many ways, you can usually see the programs completely out of sequence without difficulty to understand what is happening. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that occupied the entire final season) and the other TREK shows, since there was more than one bigger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and was further seen in SG-1. The conclusion is that, in many ways, this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take shape. Sure, there were some "disposable" episodes that were not related to the rest, but they were very few and very often and they were also quite funny. <br /> <br /> And speaking of funny, I loved that SG -1 kept the mood light from time to time and it was not so terribly serious. In this way, I enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and his love for Homer Simpson; It is really very bad that it fades from the series in later seasons. <br /> <br /> To truly appreciate the SG-1, you should see it from the beginning and see how intricately the graphics work. This coherence gives the show an exceptional staying power. And, if you do not like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, then science fiction is probably NOT the genre for you.
