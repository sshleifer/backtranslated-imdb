Those who are not familiar with the alter ego of Cassandra Peterson, Elvira, then this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, the lover of darkness" begins with our heroine with tits that defy gravity by receiving a message. It seems that a great aunt of her has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will. Eager to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go with the hope of obtaining a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place you have to go to is Fallwell. Massachusetts When having to remain a spell because his car broke down, he discovers that his great aunt left him 3 things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. The residents of the city have different reactions: teenagers like her, women hate her and men covet her (although they try to remain the moral pillars of the community). His biggest problem turns out to be his great-uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants his cookbook. It seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful sorcerer. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite funny, with Peterson aka Elvira using his "dowries" and sensuality as a joke ("And do not forget, tomorrow we will show the head with two things ... I mean the thing with two heads "). Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who works harder to keep the city online, but who seems ridiculous (The picnic scene is the perfect example). She deserves a look (The movie, not her tits, of course).
