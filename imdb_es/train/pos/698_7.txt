I've seen this movie a while ago, after having asked for my friend, who is a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The film itself was very interesting, although it had its positive points, which for me was the kind of "wtf?" From Donnie Darko. factor after the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Of course, with positive points they also come negative. For me, the girl in the movie was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job too. Unfortunately I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. This could be just me, and I'm not saying he's a serious critic, the way I'm not skilled enough, but he did not seem convincing as an actor. But maybe it is even more striking then, because although I am not a critic, this catches my attention. <br /> <br /> To conclude, in general I think it is definitely a movie that is worth seeing. It's interesting, confusing, and you should have seen it.
