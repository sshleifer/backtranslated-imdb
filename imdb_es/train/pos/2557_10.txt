I myself am a child at heart, which means that I love watching cartoons, I still do! I remember seeing Bugs Bunny as a child, it was my favorite yet. I thought, man, this was a great "new" program on television, and then my father said: "Bugs Bunny, I remember seeing him when I was younger" and I said: "Dad, Bugs did not exist when you were younger" . So I guess he's definitely pleased with more than a generation, possibly 3. I love the program, it's great for kids and adults, it's okay, everyone. It's very funny, me and my husband, both in their twenties, we love watching the programs and we do not care about the repetitions. This show brings many memories, happy. I also love the Christmas special with Tweety as Tiny Tim, it's cute. I can not choose my favorite character from Looney Toons, because they have changed over the years. When I was little, it was Bugs, of course, and Porky Pig. Pepe is great, I've always loved him. In fact, I have to say all my favorites. I give this show a 10 out of 10, because it is a great show for all ages, very funny, the voice acting is amazing, the only flaw is that unfortunately came to an end, two decades ago, but the repetition! they are great!
