Actually I really liked this movie, a lot. Not because of its plot, acting, jokes, no. I liked it, because it is one of the worst movies ever created. It's so bad, so bad, it becomes terribly funny. Some jokes are really great, but the rest makes me pray for the writer's unemployment. The "men in white" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the television or roll on the floor laughing (the beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
