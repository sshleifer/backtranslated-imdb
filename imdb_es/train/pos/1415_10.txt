I saw the German version of the film on German television and I was very surprised. In general, I like watching documentaries, but I can not remember having seen one that is better than "The Earth". I knew some of the scenes from the Youtube videos that I found when browsing at random. I also remember seeing parts of the movie in multimedia stores, running on the high-definition TVs shown. After watching the movie, it's obvious to me why the video is so popular with YouTube users and multimedia retail managers: it's so amazing and spectacular that you can not stop looking at the screen, no matter if you're interested in it. nature. Documentary or not. <br /> <br /> Without doubting a 10 out of 10. Certainly, there are more exciting films, but as far as documentaries are concerned, 'The Earth' is definitely one of the best of its kind.
