['I love this movie. It&#39;s one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and still find attractive. Congratulations!! I think everyone involved in making the film and the script should be proud of themselves. It&#39;s so weird, you feel like you&#39;re watching a real life band. I would like to see more movies like this one. I&#39;m glad you did not choose the famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked. And even if Billy Connolly is quite well known, he really got caught up in the role and I could not imagine anyone else playing him. Congratulations again, I really believe that this film deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And when you get to the final scene ... well, what can I say?']
