Yes, this is a horror anthology film and it was very funny. This is because, although the film was clearly horror, some of the stories had a light spirit, and even occasionally there was some laughter. This is not a bad thing at all, since sometimes horror movies are a bit congested and too serious. Because of this and because the four stories were pretty good, it's one of the best movies of this style I've seen. <br /> <br /> The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. Four different stories involve people who rent the house or investigate what happened to the tenants. <br /> <br /> The first segment was starring Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who has a writer's block. Then, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately, Elliott's block vanishes and works constantly in a story about a serial killer. Surprisingly, soon after his block disappears, he begins to really see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears, making it look like he's losing his mind. This could be the best of the stories, since the pleasant end of turn makes the story come alive. <br /> <br /> The second, although not bad at all, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girlfriend who died some time ago (although her image seemed incredibly contemporary). When he enters a wax museum in the city's chamber of horrors, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and this fascinates and frightens him. Later, a friend (Joss Ackland) visits him and he, too, sees the figure and is fascinated by it. All this leads to an end that, frankly, was a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee stars as an incredibly tough and stern father for a pathetic little girl. For most of this segment, Lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his behavior. Although slow, this ended very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was the dumbest one and was meant to parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third "Doctor" of the television series DR WHO) is a very temperamental actor known for his portraits of Dracula. However, nothing is good with the film according to him and, in a fit of pique, step on the set to find better accessories for this vampire movie. Actually, it is quite interesting that he played this role, since it seemed natural to Christopher Lee, who played Dracula or other vampires a bazillion times (more or less). I enjoyed the Pertwee line when it basically said that Lee's recent incarnations and Dracula's other incarnations were crap compared to Bela Lugosi's. Maybe that's why Lee did not take this part! Despite some very silly moments, it was very entertaining and fun, possibly as good or better than the first segment. <br /> <br /> Considering that the film started and ended so well, it had an excellent acting and writing, it's difficult I do not like this movie.
