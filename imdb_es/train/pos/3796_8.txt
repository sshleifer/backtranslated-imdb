Jim McKay has made one of the best movies you'll see throughout the year. The silent simplicity of this film attracts you from the first shot and never abandons it. There is not a false note in the whole movie. Any. Everything works. The handheld camera never distracts and should always be where it should be. The three young people whose lives we follow are always real. There is not a single rhythm in which the audience is reminded that we are seeing actresses playing a role. only real girls who try to find themselves. There is no political agenda, hidden or otherwise. This is cinema in its most basic form, and although it's probably only seen by a handful of moviegoers, it deserves a much wider release. Special congratulations to Hugh Hefner for providing the filmmakers with the grant money needed to make this important film. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay will do next.
