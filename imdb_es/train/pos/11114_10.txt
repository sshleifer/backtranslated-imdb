['It&#39;s probably not fair that I have to see most of all the interesting reviews about the Sopranos and then add what people have forgotten, but well ... <br /><br /> From the point of view of acting, how could an actor fail with these characters? Each one fascinating and intense in its searches of life. Tony Soprano, although he is a &quot;Capo&quot; mafia and suffers from a mental illness, still sees his life in front of him and knows what must be done to survive. Each of his men sees their lives virtually from the inside as the truest form of voyeurism. It definitely brings out a &quot;curious&quot; side in every viewer, and I&#39;m included in this! <br /><br /> While some of the above do not care about Bracco, I must say that this is the most recent role he has had in years since Good Fellas. She is the side of Tony that makes him listen to reason, that makes him decent, that offers him a respite when he deals with his human emotions that he has not been able to feel for so long, if he has ever done so. She simply puts on, her savior. (Not spoken in religious tones) <br /><br /> But the eighth-finals performance here is, without a doubt, Edie Falco. To see her role as prison guard in the other acclaimed HBO series, &quot;Oz&quot; and then see her as Livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress. She has transcended the limits of a recognizable actress, something only actresses like Merle Streep can achieve. A kind of chameleon quality to transcend roles. But as I mentioned before, with characters as strong as these, how can any actor fail? <br /><br /> Livia&#39;s strength lies in her daily affirmation of faith in herself. She is a survivor, since she expects her husband and family to be survivors. She is prepared for the worst because she knows the dangers of her husband&#39;s business, but she knows that the lifestyle she has is more than most Jersey women. She is wise if she is not wiser and more knowledgeable of the street than Tony himself. <br /><br /> In general, the biggest crime of the Soprano family is that we, the spectator, have to wait until January 2000 to see the next season. This in my opinion is the worst of the HBO series. It was what made The Larry Sanders Show, Sex and the City, Dream On and others come back to earth in popularity and eventually kill them. Too much space between seasons and very sporadic. Until then, I will see the repetitions with the hope that this vacuum will be filled in the programming.']
