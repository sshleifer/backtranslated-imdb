It's hard to rate movies like this, why do you rate it in production or just for fun? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in 1988/89 about when I was a child and I regret They say that I started a lifelong fascination with ninjas. The plot is quite serious and the performance is, of course, terrible, but there is a certain mystique around the ninjas in this film that creates a good atmosphere. What is important are the fight scenes, while a small "small", are really good. <br /> <br /> I must say it was better when I was a child, only now I can see the obvious points of incredible nonsense in the movie, but like a martial arts movie of "relax with a few beers" I do not I can complain, it is delivered and it is much better than the "American Ninja" trash mountains that were produced in the 80s with hundreds of men in black suits but really not very good fight scenes. <br /> <br /> On an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killers made another ninja movie under the banner of the Bonaire movie called "White Phantom" I have no idea if this was a sequel from Sakura Killers ", but the Sakura clan is once again a main feature, which includes the same logo and a similar story, but this time it also includes a White Ninja.This too, although it is mostly serious, It had a small sense of the environment, but the scenes of struggle are even scarcer and, to be frank, they are quite horrible. <br /> <br /> So if you are a fan of martial arts, give it a blast to kill a few hours!
