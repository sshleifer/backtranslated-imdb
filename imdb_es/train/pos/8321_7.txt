This is a nice movie, even if the premise is silly. It was a kind of guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to achieve roles in this type of movie (another example is Joe against the Volcano). That's what makes her a star, in part. Walter Matthau, of course, also had that ability, and he really puts himself on paper, making Einstein a fun, good-hearted character. I guess you could say that both are good at portraying adorable characters, though kind in different ways (adorable little girl against adorable quarrel).
