The first time I saw this movie was when I was a child and it is the only time in my life that I remember putting my hands on my face and eyes with horror in a particular scene. I remembered it again with a disscusion with my college friends and I quickly bought it in the video with many doubts I could add (to my surprise, I only found it on the web in the United States when it was made in England.) I saw again my reaction and, to my surprise, they were almost the same, out of sheer horror and fear, and my heart has never been beating so much. This is, in my opinion, the SCARIEST movie that has been made, the Hollywood movies seem tame in comparison and a little Pony and Trap (garbage), sorry for the pun. However, what is amazing is the power of this film and in the university, seeing this with a score of my colleagues, I have never heard so many screams, too! Even the view of the video brings me the fear of God of that particular scene, and left me with the feeling that I will never again walk alone in the dark.
