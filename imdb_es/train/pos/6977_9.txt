I'm really addicted to Caprica, because it's a very good prequel series by Battlestar Galactica. It really has a slow start, but it will surely recover soon after the new episodes continue to air. <br /> <br /> I've heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season. <br /> <br /> This science fiction drama will surely please fans who love the mix of both genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does an amazing job, as does Polly Walker as Clarice Willow! <br /> <br /> It's totally worth checking out! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica on Fridays at 9pm / 8pm Central in SYFY
