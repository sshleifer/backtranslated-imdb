The big problem is where to start, since this movie needs your attention in the next two hours and it is better not to miss a few minutes to get a coca because there is a danger that can not continue. But well there is also a pause button. Bruce Willis must travel in a time machine to find an antivirus for a virus that made animals dominate the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes, first it ends in 1990, then in World War I and how everything looks tangled. Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts in history. This ex-man of Monty Phyton knows exactly how the great science fiction stories should be told and his casting choice could not have been better, there is the lunatic Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and an excellent Bruce Willis, who proves who is more than a Schwarzenegger, wants to be. It's a movie that you can watch again and again, since the script is so strange and complicated (and you can still follow it) that each view offers you other surprises. One of my big favorites.
