['I saw a special special preview of this today. I have to tell you that I am not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really did not have any expectations about it. I ended up enjoying a little. <br /><br /> Dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who will spend a weekend with his family. While in a bookstore, he meets the woman of his dreams, only to discover that she is his brother&#39;s girlfriend. <br /><br /> This movie is pretty well done: the soundtrack, the cinematography and the acting are all first class, especially Steve Carell. My problem with everything was that there seemed to be a lack of development of the character, mainly with the character of Dane Cook. We never got to see the relationship between the characters of Dane and Steve up close, and I felt that it might have helped a little to show what Dan&#39;s inner conflict was about being in love with Dane&#39;s girlfriend. However, apart from this, Dan in real life is definitely a solid and sweet movie, definitely a good break from all the horror and action movies we&#39;ve been receiving this year.']
