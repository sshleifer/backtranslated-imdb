An excellent movie about two policemen who love the same woman. One of the policemen (Périer) killed her, but all the evidence seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unfortunate Montand does not know who the other lover who could have killed her is, and Périer also does not know that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must find the murderer ... and what a great ending! Highly recommended
