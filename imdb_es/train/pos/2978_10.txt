BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a movie off the wall starring the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two lazy friends who create a sport on their driveway that becomes a national sensation. Most gags are really fun, but the funniest parts of the movie are when players try to "get out of the mind" of other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things possible. One flaw of this movie is that the rhythm is too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking "Are you done with this?" Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continually harass Squeak, who is an exaggerated little man. BASEketball is a comedy classic with some highly priced lines, and it's fun to watch!
