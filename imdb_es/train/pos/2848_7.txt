['New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films, with each segment lasting approximately 10 minutes. The shorts are not exactly related, but they all have something in common, love. Each short film is about finding love, whether it&#39;s about a couple or just two strangers chatting. The film is starring a cast, including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise, I expected a tremendous film; The problem is that New York I Love You does not block. It is still the sum of its parts. Some of the segments are fun, original and interesting, but others are meaningless (the Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments) which is horrible. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. In regards to the story, it seems to be something that some film students could put together. That said, the movie also has some great moments, one of the best is the segment of an elderly couple, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, walking in Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. And there are moments like this, that made me a spectator, I wish the film was more consistent, because there is a lot of potential here. But, as unsatisfactory as the general story ends up being, for me, the cinematography and the soundtrack saved everything. The editing was perfect, the way the film was filmed was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack could not be more appropriate. In the end, New York I Love You feels like an experimental movie, and as in most experiences there are ups and downs. It is how the film is seen as a whole that will determine whether you like it or not. It may be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others. <br /><br /> 7/10']
