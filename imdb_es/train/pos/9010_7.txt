A little peculiar and bordering on bad taste; But smart enough to be worth seeing. A young woman with a wheelchair, Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) is associated with a reluctant caregiver, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who dreams of human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to resurrect his own life with problems by taking care of the independent and dying Jane, who suffers from a neurological disease that has left him speechless and with very few motor skills. Sitting in a wheelchair and full of spirit, his last desire to die is to lose his virginity. She offers herself to Richard, who will not help her directly; but he is willing to rob a bank to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this film ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and sympathy.
