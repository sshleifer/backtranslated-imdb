['Micro-phonies is a classic short Stooge. The boys are inept repairmen working on a radio station, and during some movements in a broadcast booth, Curly&#39;s perfect imitation of a recording of &quot;Voices of Spring&quot; is confused with something real, leading to a contract of radio and a funny musical party. . The simulated interpretation of the quintet trio of &quot;Lucia de L&#39;Amamore&quot; is especially entertaining. No doubt this is an essential visualization for the Stooge fans. <br /><br /> Although the evidence of Curly&#39;s poor health is visible in his face and voice, his performance is amazing, and is probably the last glimpse of old Curly. Some fans think that &quot;A Bird in the Hand&quot; is the last great Curly short, but its harsh voice and slow movement are too hard to see.']
