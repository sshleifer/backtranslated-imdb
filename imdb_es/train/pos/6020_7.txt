A beautiful and new impression of "Zabriskie Point" is playing in Paris and it seems that it is doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full evaluation of the movie. Hopefully the new impression means that a DVD with some insightful "extras" will come out in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing ZP when it came out and I thought it was a bore. This time I was totally impressed and I would classify it as an "almost lost" masterpiece. The first part of the film is a time capsule of Los Angeles in the late 60s, I lived there then, and Antonioni did a masterful job to capture the essence of the place. Congratulations to the production designer Dean Tavoularis, who found some incredible locations and did an outstanding job. <br /> <br /> The print I saw runs 1 hour and 50 minutes. It is forbidden for those under 16 (or 18, I can not remember). I suspect that there is a bit of restored images in this print. SPOILER - I wonder what part of the desert sex scene was originally cut. What seems today seems rather docile by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There is no music from the soundtrack until almost 1 hour after the movie. Before listening to strange noises, such as radio transmissions, etc. Antonioni dared to do this. I remember how much was done at the time of the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette did not bother me. Halprin is weaker, but gradually improves as the movie continues. <br /> <br /> Much of the images of student unrest seem to me archive images. A shot is in a different aspect ratio and distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there are real images on the scene, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni did some of the Frechette shots on the plane. It seems that he really did some flight, there is no blue screen or twice in some shots. <br /> <br /> I hope to return to see the movie for the second time. Highly recommended for all Antonioni fans.
