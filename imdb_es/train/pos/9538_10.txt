['Why are not there more movies (especially American ones) like Meatball Machine? <br /><br /> This is my first official online review and they accuse me of &quot;electric ecstasy&quot; after choosing &quot;Meatball Machine&quot; as my first effort. This is a review, so I will try to limit myself to mere reflection and visceral emotion. <br /><br /> I mean, this is a creative work even though it&#39;s clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO. So, what if it&#39;s not all original? I own these two movies and although Tetsuo is a strange son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is far superior and can sit without the strong desire to enjoy a dose of mind-altering drugs to clarify the meaning of the film. Meatball Machine is as elaborate in its history as it is in its high influx of blood and blood. Thank you Jesus for the Japanese cinema! <br /><br /> In short, the last time my dreams were invaded by past horror visions after seeing Nightmare on Elm Street when I was about 7 years old. I could imagine in my dreams a language that came from a phone for weeks. This time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly inspiring. <br /><br /> In this film, human bodies are hosts of Aliens whose sole purpose is to try to fulfill their endless extinction for human flesh and blood. Humans become carnivores eating cyborgs !!! There is more!!! Fight scenes !! Good music!! Great point of view shots! Decent performance of the Cyborg woman (at least better than her male counterpart). The fight seen at the end is worth seeing ten or twenty times. <br /><br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention it&#39;s a love story! Wow, I hate love stories but this takes the cake! <br /><br /> I can not wait for my friends to come see this movie once again to see the reaction in their faces. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because I am afraid that most friends and family do not understand the Meatball Machine. The truth is that America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine. <br /><br /> Finally, my wife came in while I was watching the scene of the climactic fight at the end and she was speechless. Normally she says something like &quot;why are you seeing that crap?&quot; This time she had nothing to say. I was glad! <br /><br /> This is not garbage. This is not just splash (splash splash is great too). This is art, my friends. art. <br /><br /> CHACHO']
