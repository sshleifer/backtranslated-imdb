Another Spanish film about the Civil War of 1936. This time they tell us the story of Carol (the charming one played by the debutante Clara Lago), a little girl who comes to live in a small Spanish town in New York. It is a journey of initiation, and soon you will discover the injustices of the human race, its stupid fights and conflicts, its contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes his best film since "Días Contados" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photograph and a good script. Try not to participate in the conflict, just show us some data and let us decide (well, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band we are) and take a great advantage of the presence and freshness of the young protagonist couple: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> A well-kept production. <br /> <br /> My rate: 7/10
