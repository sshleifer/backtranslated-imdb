Actually, I liked it. The premise was good, the story fit where the two respective series ended, and here's my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or make possible meetings (An excellent example is Susan Dey, "The family of the partridge"). In fact, Valerie was saying that she would be happy to make another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so she would be looking for another one ... but if that does not work, then she can rerun this one.
