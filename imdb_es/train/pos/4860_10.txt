Damsel in Distress is a delight due to the great songs of Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and an excellent cast cast headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> In general, the typical plot of an Astaire film has him as an American dance star in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen as his secretary. They invent a story about him being a love bug with women who are victims of him from left to right. He meets Fontaine, who is held captive in his castle by a dominant aunt and a docile father. Silly plot <br /> <br /> Great songs include A Foggy Day, Things Are Looking Up, good work if you can get it, and now they can not bother me. Fontaine does not sing, but makes a short (and decent) number with Astaire. Surprisingly good in some of the dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, which include an ingenious and fun game through an amusement park. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble and my favorite: Jan Duggan as the lead singer of madrigal. <br /> <br /> Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio that sings Nice Work if You Can Get It. Their facial expressions are hilarious. She was also a scene thief in the W.C. The Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, playing Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> This film has accumulated a lot of abuse due to the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been terribly grumpy. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes Two more possible disasters. Fontaine is fine as Alyce and the dynamics allow the musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with ample comic relief from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Funny movie, great songs, good cast and Jan Duggan in an unusual place. !
