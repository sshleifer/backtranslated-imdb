CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. He won the "Best Short Film" award at The 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also won the "Excellence Award" at the Japan Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When little kitten Nyaako steals Death's soul, she and she Brother Nyatta embarks on a strange journey to retrieve it. In the surrealist dream landscape of the Other Side, they encounter many fantastic characters and remarkable adventures, often disturbing. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty in acid! It is very original, surprisingly beautiful and has a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surreal (there is no dialogue) and, sometimes, cruel and bloody. So it's more an anime for adults than children (they may not understand it at all!). A great trip for those who have the opportunity to see this absolute masterpiece. A must see!
