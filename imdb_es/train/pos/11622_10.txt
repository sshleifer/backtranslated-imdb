Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star in this action thriller written and directed by the master of suspense, Wes Craven, himself. The whole movie starts with some problems at The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem is solved by Lisa Reisert, the hotel manager. Then she goes to the airport, and that's where all the problems start. Meet Jackson Rippner, who does not like to be called Jack by the name of Jack the Ripper, if you know him and I mean him. Then they get on the plane and, crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit side by side. For the next half hour, Lisa is terrified, tormented and terrified by Rippner. I will not give anything away. Then we go to where Jack is chasing Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay, and crazy enough, Rippner is already there. There are almost twelve minutes of violence and great intensity throughout the entire scene. In total, about 25 minutes of intense action come to an end. <br /> <br /> It was not just an intense movie, it had a great plot. Like I said, I'm not going to give anything up because it's so shocking and exciting and something disturbing / frightening. And the performance of each of the characters in the film, even those without lines, was perfect. That was incredible. Everything was amazing in this movie! The acting, the music, the effects, the makeup, the direction, the editing, the writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely the master of suspense. Red Eye is definitely a must see and it is definitely worth spending your money. You could watch this movie again and again and it would never get boring. <br /> <br /> Red eye, I have to say it's better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA Classification: PG-13: some intense sequences of violence and language <br /> <br /> My MPAA classification: PG-13: some very intense sequences of violence and language < br /> <br /> My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, terrifying scenes, disturbing content
