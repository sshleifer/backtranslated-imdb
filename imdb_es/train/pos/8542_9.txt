_Waterdance_ explores a wide variety of aspects of the lives of the wounded in an artistic way. From the small torments of defective fluorescent lights to sexuality, masculinity and depression, the experience of disability remains open. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the central characters underlines the complexity of the material examined: Joel, The writer, Raymond, the black man with a turbid past, and Bloss, the racist motorcyclist. At first, these men are united by nothing more than the nature of their injuries, but they retain their competitive spirit. Over time, the shared experience, both good and bad, unites them as friends to support each other. <br /> <br /> The most obvious of the transformations is the one experienced by Joel, who initially moves away from his fellow patients with sunglasses. , headphones and curtains. As he accepts the changes that disabling has done in his life, Joel discards these accessories and begins to get involved in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the room. <br /> <br /> The dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep your head above water; To abandon the dance is to reject life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful film on many levels, and I do not hesitate to recommend it.
