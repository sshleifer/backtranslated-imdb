Great fan of the ramones. I like ramones, and I suppose if you hate them, besides being an avid supporter of Bush, you may not like this classic. <br /> <br /> It's immensely better than John Hughes' teen movies. That's how the 80's get dirty. Infinitely better than the American Pie's that torments us now. <br /> <br /> There are some other great high school movies: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High and the corny but clinging (it does not seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it is the most fun and fun, and you can also get up and dance with him. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
