"Dick Tracy" is one of the favorites of our family: the actors are great, the artistic direction is exceptional, the music is magical. It's not supposed to be "To Kill A Mockingbird": it's a fun experience. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondhemim's songs are stellar: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Sooner or later" is the right thing to do. "What Can You Lose" is disturbing, even melodies like "Live Alone and Like It "are added to the story <br /> <br /> gotta love the dizzying performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, support villains ... the list is too long. And yes, even Madonna and Warren Beatty are incredible. Written with a smile per minute (how many times do we look at each other and say: "Wait a minute, I'm thinking it's gone"?). <br /> <br /> However, One of the most revealing things about this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time, and that, above all, contributes to the enjoyment of the viewer. So, if you have not done it yet, why do not you give Dick Tracy a chance? Accept it for what it is: a Sunday comic that comes alive, and in a wonderful way!
