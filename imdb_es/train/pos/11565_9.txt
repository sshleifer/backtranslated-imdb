SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is another people". In "The Odd Couple," Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau demonstrate how accurate this can be. As Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau, respectively, create two good friends who decide to live together. As the two begin to grow slowly, they increasingly frustrate each other, the laughter becomes dense and fast, before Felix leaves, leaving Oscar as a changed and cleaner individual. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely excellent as a neurotic, the divorced obsessed with cleanliness faces life as one man. Walter Matthau, in contrast to the character of Lemmon, is as good as the sloppy sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his son's benefits. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are magnificent in their selected roles, for some The degree depends on the beautiful script of Neil Simon and, simultaneously, because they work well as a team. As two friends who are intrinsically different in lifestyles, although they are similar in relationships with ex-wives and children, these two great last-minute actors create an association that is practically impossible to recreate. So great in fact, that the world shouted so much for something similar, that two years before the death of Matthau and three before Lemmon, the characters met in a lower sequel. This idea, while following Hollywood's annoying obsession with sequels, might have worked to some extent, but at the same time, it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it's not like that. It is really possible to say anything else. With the amazing script of Simon, full of humor and laughter, the creators of this film already had a great success. The cast of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, however, is the most important part of this film. "The Odd Couple", with its traditional soundtrack (which even won a tribute in "The Simpsons"), is an excellent script and is a leading genius, it is a tribute to the cinema and a characteristic that history must remember.
