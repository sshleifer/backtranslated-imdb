As this film is completely in the Swiss dialect, it is likely that most German speakers will actually follow this movie. I'm not from Switzerland, but I worked there for a few years, so I had the opportunity to understand this great parody of the Lord of the Rings. I have seen many movies of this type (for example, Scary Movie, a lot of Scifi parodies, etc.) but this is the best of that type, I've seen it so far. I give a 9 out of 10. The only reason I can not give a 10 is because there are some small details that could have been done better and because they did not provide subtitles in any language on the DVD, so there is almost no possibility of not Swiss to understand.
