This is a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel that the end has occluded this film with great recognition. <br /> <br /> It has been shot in a rather naive way. This is clearly done to create a more chilling sensation for the film: a feeling of isolation manifests itself very soon due to this filming technique. <br /> <br /> The horrifying characters are very well represented and presented, especially the 'nutcase' 'named Joe. However, healthy (normal) characters are a bit too pathetic for my taste; It is true that they are supposed to be pathetic, but this is a bit OTT. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly (and the naive work with the camera smells like 'B' movie to begin with, and very normally, but soon the imminent brutality that is about to occur is perceived. of the most "twisted" films with respect to cold-hearted violence. <br /> <br /> After the abrupt and incredibly lazy ending, I felt disappointed, I would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in line with the rest of the movie, but as it is, he only gets a 7 in the strength of the 'stranger' and the scenes that have bitten his nails at the beginning of the movie. <Br>> Give him a watch and excuse the end!
