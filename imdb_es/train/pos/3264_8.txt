What a loss it was the death of director Emile Ardolino! I could take a light script and, with the right casting and editing, put a shine on it and make it shine like a star. It is possible that this particular star is not the brightest in the sky as great romances go, but it is definitely one that keeps you in tune until the end. You really want to know how things are going to work. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect for Cybill Shepherd, who at that time needed to capitalize on her "Moonlighting" success for the new generation that was (thankfully for her) probably unaware of the large number of flaws on the big screen that had after a very promising start. In this film, she is back in top form as a widow who still lives indirectly and lives through her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson at the height of stardom, which would reach its peak with "Fried Green Tomatoes" two more years late). He may have seemed too young for the role, but that works well for the way the story unfolds. This is his film, but it does not surpass his limits as a leader. <br /> <br /> SHepherd kindly allows Robert Downey Jr. to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic style than he had in his previous films at that point. And there is broad support from Ryan O'Neal (in his best role in years) and Christopher MacDonald. The natural charm of Masterson is quite expensive on its own, either or it has a way of making your character look like a breath of fresh air with every word. <br /> <br /> Ardolino makes good use of the sexual attractiveness of his cast. in the same way he did with "Dirty Dancing", but this movie is not so hot, so you could still see it with your parents if they were in the room. (Use your best judgment, after all, are your parents). I give this film a high score because it is so easy to use, romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime, and those who simply see them together with them should find a lot of humor. There is also humor to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Again, the credit goes to Emile Ardolino for making the most of a charming script by Randy and Perry Howze. (Where are they now?) The next Ardolino movie would be the sequel to "Three Men and A Baby," but his latest release in the theater (Sister Act) would finally give him the nine-figure success he deserved. Mr. Ardolino, your cinematic touch has been lost!
