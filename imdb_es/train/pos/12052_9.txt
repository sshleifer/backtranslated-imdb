I saw this on TV so long ago that I do not remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the most frightening and disconcerting movies I've ever seen. There is a simultaneously subtle but intense fear induced by the woman in black who is lurking on the edge of the frame, not very clearly visible, so she feels (like the hero lawyer), not knowing if it is just imagination or not. It is also one of the few movies that really made me afraid to keep watching. "Production values" are hung, good films refer to the ability of a director to create an atmosphere using films, actors, locations / scenarios, music, attention to detail and ... imagination. A true jewel
