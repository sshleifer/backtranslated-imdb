In my opinion, half of the film, especially the love scene is a bit too long, but all the time you can imagine this feeling of the desert. but the best thing, what made this film unforgettable are the great pictures of explosions, its color, slow motion and pink floyd music are unique in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Destruction in its popular and popular form.
