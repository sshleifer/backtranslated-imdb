It is not known if Marilyn Monroe met and spoke with Albert Einstein (and since the mysterious disappearance of his diary after his equally mysterious death, we may never know), but in his life the opportunity was there. <br /> <br /> Written by Terry Johnson of his own work, the insignificance of Nicolas Roeg imagines a meeting in a New York hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus Joe DiMaggio (Busey) and the senator Joseph McCarthy (Curtis), but only on one level. On another level, it elevates (or reduces) these "personalities" (and what is a lousy phrase) to mere avatars (the characters are deliberately nameless), both greater and lesser in status. <br /> <br /> The title Insignificance is both appropriate and deeply ironic; Here, DiMaggio's net worth has been reduced to little more than an image on a chewing gum card. Monroe also comes down to its constituent parts of dress, hair, lipstick, wiggle and voice. By uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles, the film highlights the notions of celebrity, exploiting the cult of personality. <br /> <br /> Continuing the theme, there will be another explosion at the climax of the movie: Hiroshima in a hotel suite, in which 'The actress' burns in an ash in seconds; A literal deconstruction of fame. Goodbye, Norma Jean. The story informs the script, which in turn shakes the story upside down. As Roeg reflected after seeing Johnson's work for the first time, "These characters were mythical, not invented by a single person, neither by the public nor by the press, probably not by the characters themselves." As interpreted by Theresa Russell, Marilyn (a closet intellectual in real life), gives a lecture to a childhood Einstein ('The teacher', played by Emil) on the theory of relativity with balloons and a flashlight, while the Professor shows his legs, in parody aware of his own role in The Seven-Year Itch, it is seen that the movie The Actress is working on the premiere of the film. <br /> <br /> History records that Monroe's then husband, baseball star, DiMaggio (played by Busey as a simpleton with psychotic tenderness), was not happy with his iconic dress-up scene in the movie, precipitating your break Just at that moment, we discovered the jealous 'Ball Player' in a bar, lamenting the fact that if "I want to see his underwear, I just walk to the corner like everyone else". <br /> <br /> In contrast to The Professor, The Ballplayer believes that the universe is round, a dispute shared by Native Americans. But the Big Boss (Sampson, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest), which operates the Roosevelt Hotel elevator, has been almost deprived of its own culture: "I'm no longer Cherokee, I watch TV." Meanwhile, 'The Senator' is investigating The Professor, who is on the eve of giving a pacifist speech to the United Nations, but which the Senator suspects is a Red. In fact, as he reveals to Monroe, Einstein feels guilty about Hiroshima, and what the future holds for white heat. However, in a seemingly Godless universe, all those worries and aspirations become insignificant in the light of a higher (atomic) power. <br /> <br /> Roeg really is the perfect director to bring Johnson's play to the screen. At all times, tortured child flashbacks and pessimistic flash-forwards (ka-boom!) Draw unexpected connections between time, place and circumstances, with the repeated visual motive of a wristwatch used to mark the passage of the time, but perhaps also to suggest that all the time is once; every moment they coexist. As its previous catalog shows, it is something of a hobby for a director delighted with the notion of synchronicity - see Do not look in particular now. Here, 1920 bled to death in 1945 and leaked by drip in the 1980s, a period in which another "Actor" has assumed his greater role as President of the United States. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds pretty heavy On the move (quantum physics is surely involved), the execution is anything but, due to Johnson's ingenious and witty script, to Roeg's playful direction, it opens an essentially scenic configuration and the cast themselves, who are in a star form. Tony Curtis, in particular, leaves prosthetic marks on the wooden panels as the paranoid and impotent senator, who is attempting a congress with a Monroe impersonator (a real one, unlike Russell), before being disappointed by his waning member. <br /> <br /> Of course, Curtis once co-starred the real Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot, and whose embrace he memorably described as "kissing Hitler". As Roeg commented, "suddenly everything seemed to be connected ... when the movie started to take shape, even the actors themselves seemed to be part of this endless bond." Everything goes in the pot, to be reduced and served in new and fascinating ways.
