A few years ago I added a comment to IMDB on the television series "The Real McCoys". I said then and I repeat that it was a lovely show, fun and entertaining, well acted with wonderful characterizations. <br /> <br /> I recently saw four more episodes on DVD MORE PLUS the 2000 meeting with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan, and Tony Martinez. As another writer mentioned here, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) have not been mentioned, but maybe they can be located through SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The meeting The show was well done and gave us many unknown ideas about the show. One part of the inside information that we did NOT get was whether or not Kathy Nolan regretted leaving the program in an unpleasant contract dispute, which left Luke as a "widow" in her senior year, which was not very good. Nolan went on to make a bomb of a comedy called "Broadside", about female nurses in the Pacific in World War II. Get it? Side stand? No, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike the bad, lacing and violent quality of TRASH on television now that it is undermining our values, "The Real McCoys" was entertained with decent values ​​and fine human beings. And I thank everyone involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, for bringing him to my family. We never missed it.
