First of all, the release date is 2009, not 2007 for this feature-length documentary about nature. It should be more appropriately referred to as: "Earth, 2009". Secondly, let me address the complaints of some critics who have watched the television series "Planet Earth" in 2006. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this TV series, but I learned here, that this movie is The most complete. Long version of this TV series 2006. I judge any film, on its own merits, not by its source. I think the results, by themselves, and the results of "Earth, 2009" are really excellent. I reject this trivial complaint from some critics: that it is simply an enlarged version of the 2006 television series "Planet Earth." And that? Really do not care. <br /> <br /> As a movie buff who has seen dozens of documentaries about nature in my life, I was amazed and very impressed by "Earth, 2009". This is the debut film of Disney's new "DisneyNature" division and follows in the footsteps of the pioneering documentaries and winners of the Walt Disney Academy Award of the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography , film editing, music The score, the sound and the narration are excellent. There have been some other documentaries of nature that also excelled in these categories. What really distinguishes "Earth, 2009" is its reach. It literally covers the entire planet, covering the seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing, it was obvious that this documentary film required a massive effort and an amount of time and talent to create. <br /> <br /> It required that three production companies make this incredible documentary film. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" tells convincingly the stories of four species about their large migrations over the course of a year. the stations that start in January and end in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two new high-tech special cameras were used for this film: one camera has a computer-controlled rotation of 360 degrees Lens and the other is a high definition camera set at 1,000 frames per second. This filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the "Earth, 2009" scenes, especially the hunting of cheetahs and great white sharks that jump out of the water to capture sea lions and an aerial view that extends over the edge of The highest watherfall of the world. There are many incredibly beautiful shots in this documentary. <br /> <br /> Through cinematography, music and storytelling, there is drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary. With a great musical score made by the renowned Berlin Philharmonic, the creative cinematography and excellent technique and the story of James Earl Jones, I consider "Earth, 2009" as the largest documentary film ever published. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication were really worth it here. This film must be seen in all the schools of the world. I preach an Academy Award for Best Documentary Film, among other prizes. Truly, an amazing, amazing, stimulating and magnificent documentary film. <br /> <br /> Very highly recommended
