Do not listen to the critics of Fuddy-Duddy, this is a jewel! The young and wealthy Joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies, and now they have to work to live! She, of course, becomes a reporter, and he, naturally, a mafia driver! Because of the wild co-incidents, their careers are in front, thanks to the gangster Clark Gable. Meanwhile, there is the possibility that the moonlight underwear swims with a lot of beautiful young things and that Joan makes a couple of dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam shovel). <br /> <br /> But none of this is supposed to be taken seriously, it's all very funny in those wonderful days before the code, when Hollywood was really bad. Joan looks very good and shows much of the emotional range that would give her career so much longevity (thank God she stopped dancing!). Gable is remarkable as a viscous gangster: he was not yet a star and he did not have to be the hero. Great to see him playing something different. And William Bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother. And there are some excellent montages and follow-up shots, courtesy of director Harry Beaumont, who moves the piece with an overwhelming rhythm, and an occasional nod to the audience! Big fun!
