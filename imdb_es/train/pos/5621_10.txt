Manso, tiny, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes it something huge. In front and behind the camera, creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces that I had the pleasure of seeing and seeing and seeing again. It never disappoints me. People, even those who know me well enough, thought / thought there was something wrong with me, based on my attraction, or should I say, devotion to "Le Locataire" They may be right, I do not know, but there is something irresistibly fascinating inside the darkness of Polanski and I have not even mentioned the humor. The mystery that surrounds the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that seizes him and, naturally, us, me. That building populated by great old winners of the Academy Award: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, this is a mandatory visualization. One, two, three, many, many viewings.
