This movie is amazing. With great characters, especially the old swordsman who can fly in the form of a fireball and jump through the trees, this film tells a classic story of the battle between good and evil forces. The final showdown is especially impressive and the music is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Very, very recommendable. However, not for younger children. This one deserves a 10.
