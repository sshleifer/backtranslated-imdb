A hot headed cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers up the crime, but must deal with a guilty conscience while trying to solve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney meet with the director Preminger in a film noir that is as effective as "Laura", his previous collaboration. Andrews is perfectly chosen as the serious cop, a good guy caught in unfortunate circumstances. Acting is good everywhere, including Malden as a tough police captain and Tully as Tierney's protective father. The screenplay by Hecht, a great and prolific screenwriter, is tense and suspenseful, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
