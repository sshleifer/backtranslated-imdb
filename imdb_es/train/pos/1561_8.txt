Enjoy this episode very much. See The Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (although all he did was swim) made my eyes open. Seeing most of the founders of the Justice League trying to bring down Lex Luthor is what I've been waiting for. This sounds a little out of the question, but doing a Justice League show in live action would definitely make me have a reason to set aside everything I normally do during the week just to watch an episode. This is the emotion I got from watching this episode. I wish they had extended this episode a little longer, like a two-hour special, because I felt that one hour of the Justice League was not enough. Now, before you get bored (unless I've already done it with my ramblings), I just want to say that Smallville is again great. Somehow he lost his touch when the show began to focus on Lana. But I'm sure the writers will simply fall back into that loop hole. :( So enjoy this episode, who knows when another good one will come out, pick it up again this Thursday, February 22, if you missed the first broadcast.
