The title of this film almost discouraged me to see it. Not being a fan of Manchester United, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit daunting, but I left my prejudices and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from a movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film sped up with me without looking at my watch and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you liked East is East you will love this movie. Granted, the story is nothing new, and the classic stories are contained in the film, but everything is done in a very funny way and with a breath of fresh air. The movie moves very fast and keeps the audience entertained. The occasional funny moments are a good laugh and not a bad attempt at humor, and best of all is a good British comedy.
