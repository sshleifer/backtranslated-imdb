I bought it a year or more ago for $ 2 (yes, $ 2), I left it on the shelf for a long time, now I watch DVD while I have a cold with a cold. <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing movie. Brilliant performances by everyone involved, especially the 6-year-old boy (about the only smiles you get in this movie). <br /> <br /> The plot reminds me of my favorite movie, Grosse Pointe Blank, but obviously that is cheerful, this has a big heart. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, clinical and forensic psychologist, a chill ran down my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary things! I work brilliantly all year. <br /> <br /> Pete
