The elegant Carol (beautifully played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her nice husband Eddie (the charming David Houseman), the extravagant Carol, constantly eats the best friend Gal Anna (deliciously rehearsed with the infectious comical zeal of the adorable Chris Jordan) and the strange Anna. , loving husband Pete (a typically good Eric Edwards) is a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex among themselves. His usual routine is interrupted when Carol's lonely, repressed, but still attractive mother, Jennifer (an extraordinarily moving performance by the lovely Jennifer Welles) goes through a visit. Very soon, Jennifer becomes loose and becomes a willing participant in the swingers' happy and pleasant carnal lifestyle, and everyone, except Carol, is eager to seduce her. The writer / director Joe Sarno elaborates an acute, absorbing and perceptive examination of the anguish of the suburbs and the limitations of the entire sexual revolution of the wild 70s; Sarno puts the traditional customs of the middle class upside down and spices things up even more with a secondary argument of mother / daughter incest. On the other hand, Sarno gets a uniform first class performance from the cast: Welles and Brooke are exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as the scandalous New Age Shandara sex therapist and Erica Eaton as a neighbor of food. . Fields Better yet, all women are extremely hot and attractive; Welles, in particular, dirties the screen with his exquisitely voluptuous figure and his ardent erotic presence. The sex scenes are really hot and quite explicit, but they are never boring or tedious. The brilliant and polished cinematography of Stephen Colwell and the folkloric, acoustic and musical music of Jack Justis, are solid and effective. Recommended visits for Sarno fans.
