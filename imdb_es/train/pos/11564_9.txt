I've seen this movie many times and I like that all the bad masters want to give it ten out of ten, but I think it would be unfair to other good films. However, I think this is one of those rare gems: a perfect comedy. It is that I would venture to one of the best comics of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched. The script is so clear that you need to stop the bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other comments. The two tracks offer extraordinary performances, the girls are excellent and the situations are very funny. Not a single word in sight (mark that Hollywood, you do not have to swear to be funny, you have to be witty) and the movement of the stage to the movie is impeccable. They do not do it that way anymore. Eternal.
