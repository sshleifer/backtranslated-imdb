Interesting characters, a lot of tension. So close to black and white without being black and white. I felt dissuaded by the casual way that the supposed sympathetic character, a quiet and almost deaf secretary, could resort to crime to ruin his colleagues, ruin people in their path and, finally, participate in a robbery, and configure someone to hit him. out as a decoy for his own escape. I am a bit disappointed by the trend of quality films that otherwise portray criminals in a sympathetic manner without addressing the injury they have done to others, other than portraying their immediate opponents as imbeciles. In this movie we never know who the money is that they really run away with, or what happens to the innocent wife that the friendly deaf-secretary uses to prepare the owner of the bar of poor quality to fall for the lost booty. Too bad, the movie could have been great.
