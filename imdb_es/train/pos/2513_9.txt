Very well done. Much anguish. Friendship may not support everything, but in the end it is all that matters, or so a group of friends learns. I've seen it again and again. The music is also amazing. When Kei loses the only friend she has, she gives up until she meets Sho, an orphan boy who is not rejected because of his true nature. On the lawless streets of Mallepa they fight for their own place in a melting pot of Asian races, and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are willing to pay. A surprise ending that takes over as much as the whole movie. I could not have enough of that. Gackt and Hyde do a wonderful acting job, proving that they are more than handsome guys who sing.
