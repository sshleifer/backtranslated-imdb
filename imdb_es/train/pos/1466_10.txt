THE PERVERT A CINEMA GUIDE (2007) **** <br /> <br /> If Loving Cinema turns me into a pervert, so be it! <br /> <br /> If you are a true 'moviefreak' like me then I am sure you can not have enough movies about making films and I do not necessarily mean the documentary in the dry and then. I mean a total discourse about the experience of watching movies. Well, if that's the case, I have a great film experiment for you. <br /> <br /> In Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph and Joseph if you were wondering) she has noticed that the philosopher cum cinephile Slavoj Zizek gives his analysis on the cinema with some impressive (and often scandalous) assumes everything from the It was Chaplin's silent until the modern era of the Wachowski brothers, analyzed, tested and pontificated on the psycho-sexual, socio-economic and political foundations and, of course, the indefinable magic of the film. With his firm, determined and almost frantic dissertations. Going on to explain how the house of The Bates in PSYCHO is actually the psyche reflected from Norman Bates in conflict with each level, since his Ego, Superego and Id is one thing, but suggesting the same thing of each Marx brother in just one stroke it is a remarkable test of faith that defeats the lay skeptic. <br /> <br /> Even though I had no idea who Zizek was? Does it resemble a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese? With his sibilant tongue and his passion, the host presents himself as a crazy prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes ingeniously inserts Zizek into several of the backgrounds of the film clips sprinkled throughout to create a humorous tone, but still allows the spoils and breath to continue at full capacity by pausing for the discussion in three acts that cover the range of films of the likes of Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and films as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> There is something for everyone and if a man can provoke a discussion or at least a reason to discuss the themes of a movie. Even if they are Freudians / Jungians? So I say that this collection of cinema theory is worth it. Look for it now if you can before it reaches the home video; It is the only way to appreciate it.
