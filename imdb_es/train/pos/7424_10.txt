I was 16 years old when I saw the movie for the first time, and it has always been one of my BIG favorites. Of course, you can not deny the attractiveness of Kristofferson in the movie: HOW FINE IS THAT MAN ???????????? Sheesh It still is. He is the bad boy that every woman wants secretly. His performance is impeccable. I played a drunk / drug addict in the same way that someone who had really happened could, and had, in '76 finally got into the car, so everything was very real. <br /> <br /> The music is BIG, and although in recent years I thought that Streisand was not the right person for him in the physical sense of beauty, I think it's more of a problem for viewers than for women . We, the girls, only look at Kris and, naturally, the men look at the female interest. My husband can not see the movie of her, she does not like his appearance. But I made him sit alone through the red Ferrari scene on the road towards the end so he could see how good he was, the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with music at full volume . I should have seen it in my 50 "plasma - WOW! And, finally, the quality of the transfer was GREAT: anamorphic and very clear panoramic screen, with great color and very little noise, except in the dark areas, which is normal in all movies. <br /> <br /> They brought me some wonderful memories of my mother and I loving this movie together, I bought her a copy for Christmas, I would have loved to see her together with her the night before. <br / > <br /> I tried to sit through the original with Judy Garland, but I think that seeing this first, I can not enter the previous era.View all the images of the concert in the '76 version was very similar to what was living in Time. <br /> <br /> I am working on Streisand's comment, but it seems that she only talks about herself and the S. So far, she has barely mentioned Kris or details about the scenes of the film Your voice sounds EXACTLY the same as then. <br /> <br /> Check it out, yes You grew up in the same period as me (born in 1960), you will love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
