It could have been better if it had been run by someone with more experience. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it's not a great work of cinematographic art. <br /> <br /> It is, however, a beautiful movie. I loved it because the local channels used to show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories. (Many love "The Fallen Idol" but I'm not among them.) I think I saw "Brighton Rock" many years ago and I liked it, but maybe I'm just thinking fondly about the novel.) Charles Boyer is not, as is true, Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character: tired, cautious, affectionate. Lauren Bacall is attractive as the British girl who falls in love with him. But the support players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. His performance is a little grand Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we meet for the first time when he gives Boyer a lesson in a universal language similar to Esperanto, is excellent, as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix could break the heart harder. She appears as a precocious precocious teenager. The character wants to be helpful. She does her best. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie highly. Not without reservations. The reservation is, first of all, that it is a bit stupid. But history and acting can hardly be improved.
