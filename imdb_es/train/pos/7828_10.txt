I show this film to university students in the law of speech and the media because their lessons are eternal: why to speak against injustice is important and can provoke the changes that the oppressed seek. Why freedom of the press and freedom of expression are essential for democracy. This is a story that must be seen about how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of Steven Biko and the journalism of Donald Woods. It also gives an important lesson in freedom of expression: "You can blow a candle, but you can not put out a fire." Once the flame begins to catch fire, the wind will blow it higher. (From Biko by Peter Gabriel, on Shake the tree).
