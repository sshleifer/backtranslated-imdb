This is a silly movie of a man who thinks. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, this could become a cult classic for you, as it has been for my wife and me, from the casting of the "voice" of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson as Martians to the simplistic population. In Big Bean, this is a movie that you can sleep or watch carefully and enjoy in any way. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy relaxed and easy humor, you make a quick decision to see the joke. As you slide through you will enjoy this movie.
