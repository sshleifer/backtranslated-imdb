I recently ran into this movie on TNT for five minutes while on vacation in Florida ... (there must be some downtime at the hotel, right?) At first I was surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any article. movie about TNT. I mean "Drive Me Crazy" is not that old anymore, right? <br /> <br /> But I stayed with that, I was surprised and I entertained. Melissa plays her role of excellent psychotic Jennifer. The cast of support (Nick, the ex-boyfriend, Karen, her best friend and her parents who control life) added a great degree of credibility. The turn at the end was a good closing of this story of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you have an opportunity, take a look! <br /> <br />
