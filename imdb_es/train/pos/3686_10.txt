Diane and I watched this fabulous movie today in Fremantle and we both agreed that the pastiche movies were far above the rest. I say this because we were fascinated by the brief five to ten minute segments that made up the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and, of course, that theme was love in its many forms. <Br /> <br /> Apparently, the film took place in the different Parisian districts, giving a particular flavor to each segment. Having been alone in Paris several times, I did not have enough knowledge to easily recognize the locations, but I am sure that Europeans and particularly the French could easily recognize the locations of the city. In any case, the viewer is immediately involved in each story due to its production excellence, so these locations in the city fade away accordingly. <br /> <br /> The film moves quickly and the viewer is absorbing a stage while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic like some of the Hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and thought provoking and they are as kind as in most of life without the media strip that buries so much beauty of life under the pile of manure more close, only to sell, sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you care for and allow this little magical movie to bathe you like a spa treatment and, when you leave, I guess you'll feel refreshed.
