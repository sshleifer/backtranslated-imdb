I have become very fond of Laurence Olivier in recent weeks, and I was thrilled when I discovered this gem. I have always found it wonderful when I find a film in which I do not have to put my finger on the remote control in case the nudity raises its ugly head. <br /> <br /> The divorce of Lady X is charming until the final scene, and must have been a real delight for the spectators in 1938. I just wish that today's people can accept and love the true mood instead of the horrible trash talk that people now call funny. <br /> <br /> The divorce of Lady X is worth the time of either.
