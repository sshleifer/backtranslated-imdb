Fortunately for us, the fans of Real McCoy (probably all the Baby Boomers who grew up in the late 50's and 60's), three of the adult actors / actresses appeared when they did it for the show's reunion, in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna died shortly after. As fun as it was to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino together again, was the total absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman equally mysterious? I understand that Little Luke had died in 1999, but I'm not sure how. I can not find information about Hassie on the Internet. Very curious why they were not even mentioned? It was so notorious, his absence in the Reunion program, that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia (if they are still alive) either, 1) asked to be left out of the discussion and, therefore, their wish was granted, or 2) TNN could not find any trace of Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), they seemed to have disappeared. Therefore, it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, Walter Brennen's retrospective was done wonderfully. They did not do anything about it ... it was the grandfather who made the show a success. I remember when I was a child, I imitated the walk of grandfather and my parents laughing (as I'm sure a million other children did at the time). A nuisance that bothered me a little, it was Richard Crenna's tendency to dominate the discussion ... sometimes interrupting Tony and Kathleen to make a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed quite capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak and say too much during the Reunion show. Regrettable, since I wanted to hear from all three, equally. In general, the Reunion Show was a real pleasure for me. I've seen it on DVD several times and I've enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
