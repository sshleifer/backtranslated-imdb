... And i mean it. If not literally (after all, I have not seen all the movies created!), At least, obviously, among those I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The rule of thumb with IMDb is this: sometimes movies are highly rated (for example, the piece of Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called "Oldboy") can be really bad. But rarely a movie that is worth watching has a rating below 6. This movie, which is worth seeing, is. A disgrace. <br /> <br /> Right, I give it a 10 in protest. The movie is not perfect. Your actual rating should be an 8 or a 9. It has some performance flaws (especially Belafonte), the script wanders, sometimes. However, what we have here is one of the best directors of all time, the Czech Jan Kadar, who directs two of the best actors of all time, the beloved Zel Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in a performance / Tour of poetic / moral force. A couple made in heaven! It is true that this film, with small flaws apart, does not please the average audience, but those interested in seeing an excellent (although, again, not beyond criticism) of the incomparable director who gave us "The Shop on the Main Street. " (the best movie about the Holocaust) should not be missed just because some IMDb rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine". <br /> <br /> It is not.
