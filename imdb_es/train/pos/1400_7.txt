Bogmeister and others have almost nailed this. Shore Leave is really the first attempt at TOS in light science fiction (which would later be perfected with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). It gave both the Enterprise team and its viewers a necessary respite from the universe that threatened the consequences of, say, the Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> Looking for a place to relax for a while, the Enterprise. it happens through a seemingly idyllic M-class planet, and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look. Very soon all sorts of absurdities begin to appear, some seemingly dangerous, but everything looks like a tide of human emotional limbs played in a strange mixture of fantastic mystery (McCoy has gone through the mirror), a psychological thriller (Kirk is harassed by an indefatigable thug of his past), and romantic comedy (no comments). <br /> <br /> TOS was the least serialized of all the series in the Trek franchise, making it easy to forget how many episodes there are. The first season focused on the hard-hit, potentially calamitous drama. Unlike the franchise writers of later series, the TOS production team was not afraid to literally go where no television series had gone before. And Shore Leave, in spite of its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (particularly Shatner, ironic given his legendary sense of humor) did not seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle in ST themes. The last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes I can remember of the entire career of TOS, both in composition and in terms of acting. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said. My recommendation: watch it while watching the whole first season as expected, order.
