While searching in the sci-fi weekly section of the local Video Rentals store, I was losing hope of finding good movies I had not yet seen. Renting Cypher was like a punt on a possibly very scarce horse. My son is so tired of current "B" science fiction that he has not bothered to see this yet. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that I did not see anything about Cypher when it was launched in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I just missed it. <br /> <br /> Well, it was a really nice surprise! This is also no B movie. It is not a "box office success" of the epic variety and it does not try to be, but rather a quiet film that must be seen several times so that its plot is fully savored. <br /> <br /> The special effects are powerful presented when they are used - my only complaint is that the super helo is a CGI leetle obviously at first sight, but they understand it well in its second appearance, and apart from that, everything the rest is first class. In any case, the effects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal anything about the plot. The structure of the plot has a Russian doll look that reminds a bit of the Basic Instinct (albeit with a very different content). <br /> <br /> I'll just say that Choosing Jeremy Northam for leadership was a coup. The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his accent for this movie hits the ear as a kind of extremely forced dialect of New England, it's a bit out of tune. See the final twist of the plot and you'll see why it's such a brilliant choice! And Lucy Liu is also right with her: "Will you kiss me? Will you hit me?" <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies several times in days, this is one of them.
