Infamous pre-code movie, really the only movie that made people insist that the Hayes Code be strictly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck plays a young girl whose father, who sells liquor, has no trouble fooling her with customers. When he dies in an accident, she goes out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her what she wants. She goes to New York and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder, bed by bed. Although obviously the real sex is not shown, the movie is pretty sordid. Unfortunately, after the value of the initial impact wanes (at the time when Stanwyck screws a wagon inspector so he can travel for free), the film becomes a bit repetitive and boring. Stanwyck itself is the only thing that makes it worthwhile to watch the movie. As always, she is fantastic.
