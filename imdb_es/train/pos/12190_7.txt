It's very difficult to say what was going on with "The Lady from Shanghai" and what the movie could have been without studio interference. The main interest of Orson Welles in the cinema at this time was to raise money for his theater; In fact, financing his own projects is what led him to look for acting jobs. He made "Lady from Shanghai" for his future wife, Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn feared for the image of Rita and stopped the release of this film for a year. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns an Irish sailor, Michael O'Hara, who falls in love with Else (Hayworth, stunning with short blond hair). Her husband is a well-known criminal lawyer Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) who is as crippled on the inside as on the outside. He hires O'Hara to work on his yacht, and there O'Hara is increasingly involved in a network of murders and deceptions. <br /> <br /> "The Lady of Shanghai" moves at full speed, although I agree with one of the posters that criticize today's films for taking the time to build a plot. Still, this movie is dragging. The scene in the house of fun is fantastic; however, Welles wanted it without music, and I think the studio reduced it. It is a pity. Photography in all is impressive, atmospheric, bold and very elegant. <br /> <br /> Welles was an excellent actor, handsome in his youth, charismatic and with a magnificent voice and technique, but in many films it is almost as if he does not trust himself or take the time to develop a character. Instead, it is based on external elements such as false accents and noses. One of the only times he did not do this was "Tomorrow is Forever", where the director gets an excellent and deep performance from him. Contrast that with "Compulsion", where he shows that he is a master of pure technical performance, as he calls on the phone in his performance. Here, Welles is fulfilling a fourfold duty: as a director, star, co-writer and narrator. The use of a completely unnecessary accent and an intense look was a quick form of characterization. However, he is always convincing. <br /> <br /> The support players are excellent, including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth, beautiful and soft voice (her song was bent again by Anita Ellis) is, as always, a complete goddess and one of the great presences of the screen. What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty. <br /> <br /> Any film that Orson Welles directed is worth seeing, and "The Lady from Shanghai" is no exception. But this leaves the viewer frustrated, as is "The Magnificent Ambersons," just like any work that Welles did within the study system. He was a great artist who should have had a freer reign; he was not. It was a strange dichotomy: he needed more freedom, but as demonstrated in some of his later works, he needed the structure of the study. Unfortunately, I could not have both.
