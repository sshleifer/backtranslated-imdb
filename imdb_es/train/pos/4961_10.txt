Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the couple that does not agree that they get into the car and do the diligence according to the need of one or the other. Morgan Freeman is extremely human, is related to each and every one, while Paz Vega is the nervous cashier behind the line of "10 Items or Less", intimidating the customers and bored of his mind. Together they explore, discover and learn from each other. To do so, of course, they must be vulnerable, interested in change and have a sense of humor, everything they both have. I wish this film were realistic, I wish this kind of story would happen more often, I wish we did not have to go to the cinema to realize that we can connect with each other, even if we have very different origins. The message of the film is based on the open heart, and it makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we are from there, a world where peace can be a possibility.
