This almost unknown gem was based on a French farce, which shows, and I say it as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is being courted by a wealthy Argentine (Roland), who asks her father for her hand in marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who has just arrived by plane and is immediately thrown into a public-led reminiscence about the last time Caroline decided to fall in love with someone else: a dilettante sculptor (Gardiner). The film shows the story of Anthony's strategy to uncouple Caroline from his sculptor, and how that experience helps him with his Argentinian. <br /> <br /> It's perfectly cast: Ronald Colman is in his most sophisticated and charming place, Reginald Gardiner is at his most cunning moment, Gilbert Roland is more exotic and Anna Lee is deliciously whimsical. The film is beautifully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); All production feels like a work of love. There are wonderful touches, such as Colman's breakaway frame and camera addressing, and the exceptional use of a sliding bar cabinet door. It's a sin that has not been released on DVD, this is the kind of movie that can spark interest in the classic movie.
