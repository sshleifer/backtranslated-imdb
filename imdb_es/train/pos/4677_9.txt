['I understand that this film is a debut film and, as such, it is very impressive. It has the feel and rhythm of a &quot;true indie&quot;, but director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision, command and judgment of a mature and experienced professional. The shots are well framed, thought and serve to advance the story. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon present a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical &quot;paint by numbers&quot; scripts. It&#39;s a story that needs talent from Judd Hirsch&#39;s caliber character to have a chance to work. Judd is fantastic as usual; such as Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise is Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to get nuances from the young actor in a role that could easily have been devalued by stereotyping or overreaching. Anyway, I found the film refreshing and entertaining.']
