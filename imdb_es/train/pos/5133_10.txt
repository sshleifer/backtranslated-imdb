Each of the main studies was launched throughout the thirties and forties (with Universal taking the initiative). While most looked as cheap on the screen as they were to do, Warner Bros. (which left them abruptly in 1946) often distinguished them with camera angles, mirrors and unconventional optical effects, thanks to some creative directors like Jean Negulesco It is appropriate that the best of this genre comes from this study. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes "Jammin 'The Blues" from the rest of the package is that it is more like a cutting-edge experiment than a hollywood musical. Filmed in July 1944, it transforms a session of ordinary improvisation into a "trippy" dream of the problems of war, highlighted by the melody of "On the sunny side of the street". Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes (who will later work with Hitchcock) were allowed a lot of artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and the studio did not care how he and his fellow musicians presented themselves. The optical printer has a good use, with multiple images of the same performer appearing at the same time. (Norman McLaren actually milked this process two decades later on "Pas De Deux", while the Linwood Dunn team achieved different effects on "Citizen Kane"). The strong emphasis on silhouettes and cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time; In a way, this preceded the psychedelic sixties, but with a distinctly black film style of the forties.
