The film has a different humanity (although brutal and rough) for all its boundary depravity. ), a semi-regrettable vulnerability is never far away (Dewaere sucks her breasts like a baby). Blier moves away from the scene in which Depardieu could be about to rape Dewaere, so we're never sure how to explicitly read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship. Without a doubt, it can be read as pro-gay, although it could probably be read as pro-anything you want). The film has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general caricature on the weaknesses of both sexes, mocking the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty, and hitting numerous points of possible depth on the basis that you shoot enough shots, some of them are bound to hit.
