Bill Paxton, from Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator, surprises me with his debut as director of Frailty. He hits all the cylinders, but there is an implausibility near the end that involves the FBI agent (Powers Booth) who deduces a point from this thriller that would otherwise be chilling and provocative. Apart from that, this movie was fine. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays dad. They never gave him a first name, but that's not a weakness of the movie. In fact, it strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see it as a kind of symbol of some kind. One day he has a vision that he says was sent by God and told him that the world is running out and that he and his two sons Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) must fine the demons and kill them . Demons resemble normal people who kill, and this makes the viewer wonder if dad just lost his mind, or if he is really doing God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points that add to the confusion and give more suspense to the film. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashback by one of the children who is now an adult (Matthew McConaughey) and speaks. with FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) who is very skeptical and rightly so. After all, not every day someone comes to your office to tell you they know who the killer is. <br /> <br /> The movie has many twists, and Bill Paxton runs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest. The performance is incredible. The two young leaders and Paxton work very well together, looking like a normal family even though everyone is involved in the murder. Like I said, there's an implausibility in the Powers Booth character, but it's not really a big deal. This was an extremely well made movie with faith and family.
