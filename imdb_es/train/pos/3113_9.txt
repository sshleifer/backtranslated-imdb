The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role in history), the new spy boy on the block, puts an end to his search for his identity while also seeking to end the latest program of the CIA "Blackbriar" to convert to super killers like himself. <br /> <br /> I was so excited about this that I saw your predecessors yesterday and today. The identity was as brilliant as I remember and Supremacy remains the weak link (but still pleasant) in the chain for the weakest plot and, apart from a car chase that the film easily pursues, it lacks action and suspense. <br /> Hoo boy, does Ultimatum have a hold? Even when you know that Bourne will escape to the authorities (and these films emphasize the police as inept), it is still brilliant to see him do it. It's amazing to think that two guys with guns and mopeds can create 10 times more suspense than anything those giant $ 150 million robots did in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Welcome Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of filming documentary stedicam, even if he is filming characters that are far from normal, in places like the CIA headquarters where he would not be allowed to anyone within 10 miles with a camcorder. He seemed to hear my various complaints with Supremacy, since the action in Ultimatum is nothing less than impressive, with several implements used as weapons such as a candlestick, a hardcover book (I will never see them in the same way again) and a fan electric (do not ask). The music also helped generate a lot of suspense, and there was almost never a moment to not bite. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles' character "Nicky" put her situation on the scene. A new highly sympathetic light. Damon plays his signature role with reserve but with competition (which seems to be minor, but it seems genuine that Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something), but remarkable moments of shock while still struggling to find his humanity. This longing for real life could become boring, and he almost did it in Supremacy, but it only works better in Ultimatum (better script). <br /> <br /> I remember a scene in "Goldeneye" (the only good movie by Pierce Brosnan Bond) in which the character of Sean Bean asks James if the martinis have just silenced the cries of all the men who he killed Bourne laments all the people he murdered, and considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of the action without purpose, life without meaning and how the government has transformed men into resources. Although, resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons with anything. <br /> <br /> Side note: It always bothers me that, despite being a superspy and being hunted by the CIA, the Interpol and the police almost anywhere, well, Bourne never thought of doing the most small attempts to disguise their characteristics or to forge some new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have a pulse and you like action movies, Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, it's probably the best action movie to come out this year. Of course, you would be a fool if you saw him without first looking at others. It's getting a bit closer at the end, but I'm almost tempted to overlook it. This is the first movie "3" this summer that at least combines, if not exceeds, the original and says something. <br /> <br /> A-
