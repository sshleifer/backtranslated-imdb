This is the first and only feature film by Paul F. Ryan. He has not done anything since then. However, he managed to get an incredible set to portray the characters in his story. I do not know when or why the idea came up in his mind, but Ryan wrote a script that later became his own directed film, "Home room". <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps carries the film on his shoulders while Alice, a girl with problems; The ones we always see in television series. With dark hair and black clothes; a pack of cigarettes in his pocket, strange appearance and disturbing eyes (with makeup, of course). An event has occurred at your school; a shooting. Some students have died, and she saw everything. Now, Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating the case and, as expected, Alicia is a suspect. But the shooting is just the genesis; The movie is not about the shooting. <br /> <br /> Lying on the bed in a hospital room is Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen). She is one of the survivors of the hospital. The script establishes a link between them, by the school principal (James Pickens Jr). He is helping all the students recover from the event, but Alicia does not seem to mind. She is isolated. So the director punishes her; She needs to visit Deanna every day until five in the afternoon. Then the movie begins. <br /> <br /> I can not even describe how wonderfully written I think the movie is. I can identify with the characters and the situations in which they live; I like reality These things can happen to anyone. And the things they say are completely understandable. They are growing and trying to deal with things they have not experienced; They are doing the best they can. Unknowingly, Alicia (when she visits Deanna for the first time) and Deanna (when she sees Alicia standing in front of her) are beginning a journey that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life; after high school <br /> <br /> The director directs Christensen and Philipps through their roles very well. Look at the contrast between them. Deanna seems naive and with clear thoughts; No complexity inside your mind. When Alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers, she asks: "Who brought them?" "Many people," answers Deanna; although some days later we learned that they are from their parents, who come every week. The parent figures are all well represented, but they are not as important as the characters of their children. Deanna is alone. Alicia seems mature and violent; smoking cigarettes and talking roughly. But after two days of visits, he finds himself returning to the hospital every day; Even sleeping in Deanna's room all night. When they both fight later, I think Deanna says, "Why are you still coming back?" Alicia is also alone. <br /> <br /> The end of the film, without ruining it, is a bit disappointing; It's something I was not expecting. It eliminates part of the force that the film has. The revelation is totally unnecessary; ruining the logical climax that the movie could have had. It was an excellent script anyway; And an excellent address. A very good movie. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Erika Christensen, this was the role she needed to fly higher. His role in "Traffic" was impressive, but this was the big step; The lead role. Maybe not many had the chance to see her in this movie, and that's a shame. She has not made a false move since then. She has even come out with good performances in horrible movies. On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who proved to be very promising in this film (what transformation), does not have many opportunities for other roles. <br /> <br /> The same as I say about Paul F. Ryan (in the curse address), and I hope he is now sitting on his computer finishing his new script; I'm waiting for your next movie. I hope the best for all of them.
