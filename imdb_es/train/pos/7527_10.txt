More than a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time that his typical biographical film, this fun and fabulous film has the appearance of the time with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie movie. I think the tendency would be to represent Bettie Page as a kind of sexual slut, like a Jayne Mansfield. But if you've really looked carefully at Bettie's postures, she always looked happy. Neither an arrogant look of "you wish you could be with me", nor the appearance of "a porn star" I'm only doing this because my acting career did not work. And so, the ladies involved in this film (three producers, one writer / director, one co-writer and the lovely Gretchen Mol, who I'm sure helped to shape this role with her own sugary influence) really caught the idea a sweet, somewhat naive, southern girl who really enjoyed taking a picture and hoped that JC's good son would not get too upset with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol has a high performance in her career (she may have more perfect breasts than ever), which makes me happy, because she had the curse. Several years ago, she appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair when no one really knew who she was, and considered her the next It-girl. And let's be honest, that was a bit presumptuous. I mean, unfortunately she has never achieved Gwyneth's status, though not because of a lack of talent. Taking some bad movie decisions when you're a pretty and fickle blonde, Hollywood makes you forgettable, I'm afraid. If this does not put her back on list A, well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. <br /> <br /> Intentionally private, Bettie has not seen the movie yet. Bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever honey floats on your boat. You were a hellish woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations Mary Harron, you have done justice to our cult idol.
