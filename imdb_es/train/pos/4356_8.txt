"The Thing About My Folks" was a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta, and based on a screen play by one of its stars, Paul Reiser, proved to be a pleasant moment in the cinema. Although the film is predictable and we know what the outcome will be, this is a journey of discovery in which Ben gets to know his father, maybe for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father for what he really is, and not by the name. Mythical figure that you have in mind. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be a vehicle for its star, Peter Falk, and he escapes with the film, as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most enthusiastic actors who work in films at this time and in recent years, is an actor of such stature, should be taken into account. As Sam Kleinman, Ben's distant father, is a man who clearly is not understood, not only by Ben, but he appears for the whole family and his wife for forty-seven years. <br /> <br /> When Muriel, the matriarch of the Kleinman clan, flees, everyone panics because this woman, who has been the strong figure of the family, is vital to keep everyone together. Without knowing where he has gone, Sam appears confused in Ben's house when he feels abandoned, suddenly, by the woman with whom he married and has been faithful during all those years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a trip to find the house he wants to buy in order to take his own family from Manhattan to the country. The trip provides the excuse for Ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew because the old man had always projected a distant figure to his youngest son. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love each other and how misguided the old man has been for his children. Sam's love for Muriel covers the many years that are known; They seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is magnificent in the movie. He is an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes that his life is about to change for the worst. Mr. Falk shines like the older man and there is never a false movement in his interpretation of man whose entire world is falling apart. <br /> <br /> Not being a Paul Reiser fan, we must confess that Ben Kleinman is right. Ben and his father discover how much they have in common and their love for Muriel, the mother who has sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as the mother who flees. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style ... <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful thanks to Dan Gillham's cinematography and the excellent music of Steven Argila. Ultimately, the film shows a great team effort between its director, DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, who wrote it for the screen. <br /> <br /> Although this film is clearly aimed at a larger audience, it should please anybody.
