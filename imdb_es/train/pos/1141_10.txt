Anyone who does not laugh throughout this film has been embalmed. I've seen it at least twenty times and I still have tears in many of the scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to replace it with the hope that her own star will rise. Fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that contradicts her by having three children. I'm partial, I'm in love with her. <br /> <br /> The cast of "Soapdish" is full of stars who play their roles perfectly. Kevin Kline is impeccable, as is Robert Downey Jr., an ingenue Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of her first roles, Carrie Fisher as the overexposed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waitress without his shirt on. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer, and best of all is that Cathy Moriarty, like Nanny Nan, who leads the plot for Fields' character to be eliminated from the series, is hilarious. <br /> <br /> This movie should have won an Oscar for best comedy, best comedy star, best comedy star and countless other best comedians, such as writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Get the DVD so you can watch it again and again for the next twenty-five years. You will still laugh when the disc runs out.
