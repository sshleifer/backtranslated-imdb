OK, where do I start? ... This movie changed my life! The plot was perfect. James Cahill has made himself. Initially, after a first viewing, I was disappointed that I had not seen it on the silver screen. However, this was before exploring the many features of the DVD !!!! Oh, my God, Jakes Cahill's comment on the movie was almost as perfect as his performance. He told the secrets of the industry used in the movie that you only get with experience. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed by the other actors. The scene in which the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) films. I certainly am with Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment without any sequel. <br /> <br /> It still surprises me every time I see the martial arts skills involved, it just matches the sign that indicates the location of the library in the school ... and possibly the kid playing a delay ! In short, a timeless classic and the best film that has left Europe in years! Where my Oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
