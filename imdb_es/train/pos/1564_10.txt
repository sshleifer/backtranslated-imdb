['Chloe was mysteriously saved from Dr. Caselli, the corrupt doctor responsible for transferring patients with Belle Reve skills to Project 33.1, and a fraction of a second later, Clark arrives. Find that Bart Allan has returned to Smallville and they are at Kent Farm. When Bart is captured by Lex during a robbery at the LuthorCorp facility, Clark discovers that Green Arrow also hired Bart (also known as Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to investigate Project 33.1. Clark agrees to join the trio to save Bart and invites Chloe to participate in his mission. <br /><br /> &quot;Justice&quot; is the best episode so far of this 6th season. In this episode, the Justice League begins its saga with the association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, The Flash (&quot;Impulse&quot;), Aquaman and Cyborg. Chloe&#39;s participation is spectacular, completing the necessary organization for teamwork. In the end, Oliver breaks up with Lois because of the importance of fighting against criminals and Lex&#39;s secret laboratories around the world. My vote is ten. <br /><br /> Title (Brazil): &quot;Justi√ßa&quot; (&quot;Justice&quot;)']
