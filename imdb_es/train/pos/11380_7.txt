Although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dance is too rigid, we must admit that the boy knows how to put on a show. In American In Paris, I choreographed some outstanding numbers, some of which paralyze the plot, but they're still amazing to watch. (For more information, see Gene Kelly's "Getting Out of Bed Routine.") <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly plays an IG that is based in Paris, he stayed there to paint, he is soon a rich woman gigolo, but he really loves someone else! A boring story, but the musical numbers save the show here. I really loved the voice work of Georges Gu'tary in this. His 'Stairway to Paradise' and his duo with Le Gene in 'S Wonderful' is 'wonderful'. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave. In short, a pretty good movie, but not dynamite.
