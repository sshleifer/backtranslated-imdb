When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby dragged out of her tent for a dingo and then begins a test that no one should have to experience. It seems that the history of the dingo is not believed by the public or the press, and everything becomes a circus. Lindy also does not help with the issue because she will not play before the jury or the courtroom, she is just herself, and it is difficult to understand, so, of course, everyone thinks that she is guilty because there is evidence that she has not come to light. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people are as prejudiced and stupid in other places as in the United States, because the Australian public does not believe that history and the media only fan the flames. Finally, Lindy is convicted and sent to prison for a life of forced labor, but years later, a piece of missing evidence appears and she is released, but not until after the family's life is basically ruined. A heartbreaking story, very well done, a little long but worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
