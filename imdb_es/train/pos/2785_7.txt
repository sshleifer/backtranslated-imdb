"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of those 80s teen movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a chewing gum world where everyone is attractive, there are some conflicts that are easily resolved and that occasionally remove mostly happy procedures, and the big plots of the plot are summarized in montages that are pop melodies. However, there is nothing wrong with this. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute pleasure from beginning to end. My wife and I were totally defeated by the taste of the corn ball, even when we were making fun, and in the end, however embarrassing this may be, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theater). Watch this movie and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
