Without knowing what this movie was about, I checked it in the video store and, after watching it, I enjoyed it. Unseen multi-genre film by director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy's, I was surprised by his British accent. The only exception for this movie was the ending. However, it is worth the rent.
