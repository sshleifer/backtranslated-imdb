Charming film directed by some of the best directors in the current industry. The film also presents some of the great actors of our time, not only from France but from all over. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> 14th district: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French and also to make sense of her life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: there probably is not a better way to start this movie than with this segment in romantic Paris. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: an image of Paris that we are more aware of since the unrest in Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time taking care of someone else's girl (she is a nanny) than hers. <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin: very funny to see Gérard Depardieu as the "bar tenant" with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing his divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: do not tell me you did not like those pampering! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: a pleasure to see Steve Buscemi is the tourist who is making a high contact (a no-no) with a girl in the Metro. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier too. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this film makes me want to go back! <br /> <br /> Seen in Barcelona (another big city), in El Verdi, on March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
