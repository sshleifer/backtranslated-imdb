This movie is very funny. What makes it great, especially are two things: one is the direct way in which the characters adopt stereotypes, with discussions about their costumes and superpowers. There is an endearing sincerity in the parody that is very attractive; The second is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves a particular note as an object of Mr. Furious's wishes. There is a boat full of talent here. I realize that some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is very funny and sweet.
