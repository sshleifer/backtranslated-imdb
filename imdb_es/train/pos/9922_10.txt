This is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries such as "The Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11." His commentary is clear and unwavering, as is the impressive cinematic style of this well-designed feature. The film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unstable our world is as we rush towards an environmentally unsustainable future at the speed of light, while showing us the terrifying beauty in our search for progress. <br /> <br /> Truly a remarkable achievement that must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children. Bravo! <br /> <br /> NB: this is also the only movie (out of 8) in Varsity theaters (Toronto) with a sticker that says ... "To organize group viewing, contact ...". .. one more testimony of the popularity and importance of this gem. <br /> <br /> My bet ... a nomination for the Academy Award for the best documentary. <br /> <br /> OB101
