['I was totally absorbed in this movie from the first to the last minute. It is brilliantly filmed, with many interesting and original camera angles and techniques. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is chosen by friends and colleagues alike. She hires an assistant at work, with his true intention to find love. He is an ex-convict and she takes advantage of him to take revenge on those who have hurt her. In return, she must help you with a robbery that requires your lip reading skills to achieve it. The film moves to a dark black cinema, with a couple of really excellent scenes and an even better ending. The true beauty of this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the main character&#39;s disability. The use of sound keeps the tension constant, and dramatic changes from silence to noise keep the blood pumping, that&#39;s for sure. Add a bit of black comedy and nuances of erotic sexual repression that has the ingredients of a great movie. It&#39;s the kind of movie that Hollywood really wants to do, but it just can not.']
