Put yourself in Carla's shoes. She is an administrative person with overwork, not appreciated, who is invisible. You know her: she has trained three of her last three bosses, she knows where all the bodies are buried and she could even look at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth. Always having time for another thankless task and doing it better than most despite a severe disability, has the desk on the way to the bathroom that becomes the repository of half-finished coffee cups that spill. What? Do not you want to hear it? Well, she can not and you can not either until your hearing aid is in place. Prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) needs a change in her life. Work does not lead anywhere; friends trust her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed. She does not go on vacation, a contract is critical, so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Carla presents requirements that express her real needs: a 'well-groomed' man. This brings an approval applicant who reminds us to be careful with our wishes. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his recruitment clearly demonstrates Carla's interest in his non-work related qualities. She sees potential in this ancient thief and, as the story unfolds, their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co-dependency. <br /> <br /> Paul has a difficult transition to return to the world outside the walls of the prison and is in another type of prison: one of the variety of offices and another of servitude to pay a previous debt. Her skills as a thief help Carla win a political battle in the office. But Paul sees a great opportunity with Carla's ability to read lips and pushes her further into a world of intrigue. <br /> <br /> This is a brutal film without value and probably suitable for older teenagers. Carla becomes more powerful, both professionally and personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us. She grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while using her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man's world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are made for each other, in a strange way. Without Paul, Carla will remain in her doormat role. She has our sympathy, hopes and best wishes, even if she does not make the best decisions along the way. <br /> <br /> He will listen to the world through Carla's ears, from uncomfortable adjustments of his hearing aid, muffled sounds, almost inaudible without relatively different voices when he can see who is speaking. With a great deactivated sense, we see the high intuitive power of Carla to compensate. And we can all use that sense to listen not only to what people say, but also what they really mean.
