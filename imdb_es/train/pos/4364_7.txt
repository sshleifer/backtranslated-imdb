I had never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before "Rob Roy" came out, but it's definitely worth watching the movie. In playing the main character, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role he gave Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a very good job as his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a person who is very likely to make his skin move. <br /> <br /> In general, this goes as well as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think about how Hollywood released two almost consecutive films hitting England. Very well. Also starring John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
