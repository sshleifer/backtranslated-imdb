This is really a great short by Hal Roach. This is due to two main reasons: the youngest children in the short film are among the most beautiful ones that have been in the film and the plot has many fun and well written elements. <br /> <br /> As for the little The Little Rascals, I honestly can not think of a child cuter than Spanky at the age of four. Despite being a pretty chubby and unattractive child in recent years, here it was beautiful. And, putting the little boy in charge of caring for even smaller children was not only fun, but once again high on the cute factor. <br /> <br /> After the older children blackmail Spanky to do this horrible babysitting job, it unleashes all kinds of funny chaos. The gags are quite effective and well made for the moment, with an accidental call involving a murder and a final scene in which Spanky FINALLY gets control of the smallest as the most memorable. I have not seen these shorts for many decades and I'm glad I gave them a chance.
