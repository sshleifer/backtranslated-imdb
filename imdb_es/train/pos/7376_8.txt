I really enjoyed this debut from Ring's director, Hideo Nakata. If you've seen Ring in advance, you'll be familiar with the style and idea of ​​this movie. It has a subtle chill that works better than the constant (and predictable) stings that infest most movies of this genre. If you like movies that cause you chills, it is likely that you like it. A good and spooky debut of Hideo Nakata. 8/10
