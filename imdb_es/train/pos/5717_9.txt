Omigosh, this is seriously the most terrifying movie I've seen in my life. To say that I love horror movies would be an understatement, and I've seen lots of them (considering the limited availability in New Zealand, that's enough), but I never had to sleep with the light on before ... until I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Some may say it's a scam by The Ring (both based on Japanese horror films), both similar (albeit different) story lines, but Grudge stands like a terrifying movie: watching in the cinema, I even shouted at a certain point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, especially by the supporting characters: KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, is such an enthusiastic person Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother seems to be having fun However, although I'm usually a fan of Clea DuVall, she really does not seem to be in this movie. Of the secondary characters, theirs probably have the deepest and later story, but it does not seem that she is there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she stays the same in all her movies and roles, is not it? The ghosts were genuinely frightening, the music and the sound effects were chilling (especially when you heard the noise when KaDee Strickland's character answered the phone in his apartment), the ending was great too. <br /> <br /> Super highly recommended. 9/10
