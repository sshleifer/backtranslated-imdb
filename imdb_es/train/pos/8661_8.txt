['I have enjoyed the Criminal Intent series of Law and Order for a long time. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the female detective is quite tough and seems a bit bitter in the Criminal Intent Series. Look at his other side in this movie. <br /><br /> This movie shows the wonderful soft side of these talented actresses and if you are a fan of Criminal Intentions, this film is a revelation in your performance and you get a very good thread of family difficulties in the South. <br /><br /> I did not like the role of Albert Finney in this film because he did such a convincing acting job for the old Southern partner who is stubborn, intolerant and does not accept the change. It reminds me of so many men of my youth and the portrait is divine, but it is likely that you will find it difficult to like it in this film. <br /><br /> Katryn Erbe is easy to like in this movie and that&#39;s why I recommend it as a 10 star for fans of criminal intent, law and order.']
