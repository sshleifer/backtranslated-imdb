['Well, the movie is not exactly &quot;fun&quot;. <br /><br /> Okay, I admit, there are some HUMOROUS lines, but definitely nothing that is fun. For example: Just before a scene of torrid sex between Eleniak and one of his male costars, sh is handcuffed to the bed shelf and can not take off his shirt. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key, he says: &quot;Okay, do not go anywhere&quot;. <br /><br /> See, humorous, but not fun. <br /><br /> The plot and the acting are pretty good. <br /><br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She is sexy and sexy, and there is a very torrid scene with her that she can not stop rewinding and seeing again. <br /><br /> There are also other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines. <br /><br /> In general, 5 stars. I would only give him three if it were not for Erika Eleniak.']
