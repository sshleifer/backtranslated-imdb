I went through "Shower" in the foreign movies section of my local video store and I passed it several times, since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy. Then I was lucky enough to buy a copy at an economical price and I am happy for my luck. "Shower" is the story of three (3) men, a father and two (2) adult children, each of whom accepts the changes in life as the world around him also continues to change in modern China. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting aspects of this film. <br /> <br /> Beyond the fascinating characteristics of the local and Chinese color that set the stage for this story, it is the difficult but moving relationships between men and the only woman involved in the story, all in the context of a bathhouse in a village. <br /> <br /> The history of the family goes from distancing to understanding and I am happy that I got to know these people. To the main story are added the many small characters, the customers of the bathhouses and their conflicts and individual friendships. "Shower" is a film that one stops smiling and moved by its warmth and humanity.
