['Probably the best fantasy movie ever made. Sumptuous color, spectacular sets, incredible, incomparable Miklos Rosza musical score that is perfect for every scene and mood. Acting is also excellent in what could have been rigid and pretentious in lesser hands, but here the poetic dialogue is spoken with dexterity and sensitivity (humor is also subtle and charming). <br /><br /> Undoubtedly, Spielberg and Lucas were captivated by this one. Along with &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1939), one of the two best films released by Alexander Korda and London Films, and one of the best films ever filmed. <br /><br /> A true, convincing classic!']
