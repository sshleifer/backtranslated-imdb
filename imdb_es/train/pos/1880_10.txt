Dudley Moore is fantastic in this rather unknown classic. This film is a very ingenious film that is based largely on the talent of the actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli and a few others, this movie could have been a disaster. It is not always well filmed and, at times, it has a very cheesy music that tries to force a state of mind (the "psychotic" music in the wedding fight), but the performance surpasses it. The character Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But it develops well in a more mature and well-rounded character as he learns to live by his own will. However, the ending is pretty corny. I will not give it away, but it could be improved. It is worth seeing many times.
