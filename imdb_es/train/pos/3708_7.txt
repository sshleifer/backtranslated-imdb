A lawyer gets involved in a deadly cat-and-mouse game when he engages with a fatal woman in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates a Gothic atmosphere of suspense, but the script is weak. With a southern accent, Branagh is convincing as a lawyer and Davidtz is attractive as an object of his desire. Downey is nice as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenger complete the impressive cast. After an interesting setup, the movie gets stuck and does not really deliver on its initial promise, but Altman is always worth watching.
