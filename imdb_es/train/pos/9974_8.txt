Of course this was a remake of a movie of the 70, but had the suspense and action of a current movie, for example, Breakdown. He is running, desperate to be with his wife hospitalized, the police is the least concern. The persecutions were very good, the part where he was <br /> <br /> cornered in a rest stop was well done, the end of the movie was a great suspense. This is better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, a chase of a car that was filmed badly? Vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape Johnny Law, few movies had night vision effects, CB radio. Well, I forgot the name of the movie, the guy has 76'Caddy ready, toys with the guy he's upset with. The end is great, you can not tell if he feigns his suicide or not, a very good "he did it or he did not do it".
