Jim Henson's Muppets were my favorites since childhood. This movie makes me feel like a child again. Well, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get to Broadway in a musical show somewhere other than New York City. You will see cameos by the then mayor of the city of New York, Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope today's children will learn to appreciate the joy of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the program is that Kermit disappears and the gang has to find him in New York City. It is worth looking for children and even sentimental adults like me.
