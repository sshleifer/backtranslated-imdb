This is the most compelling and excellent performance that Robert Taylor ever gave. He even surpasses his wonderful performance as "Johnny Eager" after 14 years after that movie. His appearance is still a marvel, but now he has a maturity that gives him the advantage in this rough and violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his race, a buffalo hunter who kills not for money but for pleasure. His death of wild eyes, not only of buffaloes but also of human beings, is impressive to observe. He is basically a lonely man, who needs the people around him, but they do not like him because of his sociopathic behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is fed up with hunting and only accepts, because he is a failure in anything else. On the way, Charlie kills a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Pagra Debra. Charlie tries to seduce her in vain, but sees that Sandy is also interested in her. Granger is a bit sad to see, so fed up with hunting, that she wants to go with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and his accordion game. Russ Tamblyn plays the mestiza trying to fit into a white world. The group is a strange mixture of good and evil, young and old. In the end, Taylor gets scared with the buffalo, as many hunters had done before him, and runs out of Sandy with the girl. Upon his return, that night, Sandy leaves with the woman, putting Charlie in a murder attack in a search to get Sandy and have the girl for him. The final confrontation occurs in a snowstorm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It's Taylor's movie at all times and he was a very underestimated actor of the time.
