I admit that I had no idea what to expect before seeing this very stylized piece. It could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for what it tasted like. It started with excellent images, small fragments to get your attention and make your imagination fly. While continuing, I quickly learned through voices what was happening. A beautiful and small neo-noir story that I felt was not a waste of a few minutes of my time. The small clues given to the audience through images at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment when reconstructing the plot. Along with a good turn at the end, it's a great package in general. The score, although not bad, gave the film almost a feeling of a music video. It just felt a bit old-fashioned, without adding anything to the story. Some of the performances felt too dramatic but they fit perfectly with the feel of the piece in general. I walk away from this very satisfied. They gave me a lot of information in a short period of time, but through an excellent editing and voice-over work, I did not feel rushed or pressured. Great job!
