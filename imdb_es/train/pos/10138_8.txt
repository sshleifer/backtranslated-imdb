Well, it's time. I had really given up on anybody and I hope that there is an outstanding episode among the entries this season. While there have still been too many monotonous entries to hohum, at least this episode turned out well. It's kind of funny that director Rob Schmidt, who only has the wrong Wrong Turn for his credit, and writer John Esposito, whose only scripting tasks to date have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift, are the ones that give us the best written and the most thought. Provocative episode of the season. In "Right to Die" we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode, the couple is having a conversation. Abbey caught Cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to get her back. While they talk, they are in a car accident where Cliff has only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is ejected from the car and burns when a spark is lit and gasoline dripped from the fire. And this is just the configuration people. Once in the hospital, Cliff must decide if Abbey should live in this state without skin and only with nervous reflexes. There is also a side effect too. Every time she makes flat lines, Abbey walks like a ghost and causes problems to all kinds of people. Undoubtedly, this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the best episodes in history. From the horrifying effects to the tense script that threw a few twists that I never saw and a suspense so palpable that you can almost touch it, Right to Die should have the right to continue living forever.
