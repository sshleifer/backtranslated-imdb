This is the magnum opus of the Swedish shit king, Mats-Helge Olsson. Rarely has a film of this magnitude been made in Sweden and it really stands out as one of the most amazing achievements of the Swedish film to date. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to defect to Sweden. But his plans are ruined by the Russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in Sweden. This trick is his way of seeing Markov continue his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the supply of energy for the entire planet. However, the CIA is bent on taking Markov to the west and sending his ninjas to release him. <br /> <br /> The practice of having Swedish actors who speak English is something that Mats-Helge has perfected in his later work. The cheap b-movie feel that this creates is probably unmatched for performance. But in addition to this? Well, the action is standard from direct style to video. Machine guns shooting huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians dying. People running in black ninja outfits, trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> What really stands out is the way in which the fight scenes are choreographed. When they say "Ninja" in the title, I expect martial arts, I expect hand-to-hand combat. But there are maybe two or three scenes of real martial arts in this movie. And they are hilarious. It's so bad that I lack the words to describe it. If the ninjas moved slower, their hearts would stop. And, of course, the entire movie ends in an explosion that indicates a special effects budget consisting of four food stamps and a McDonald's coupon. <br /> <br /> So, what is the verdict? Instant classic of course. Never before had a movie been made that obviously had to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol. It's the best party movie. Insert in video and laugh. One only has to realize that movies like these are not made. This is the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
