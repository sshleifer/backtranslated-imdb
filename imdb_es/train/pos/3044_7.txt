['For anyone who does not know what a single-actor movie was like, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous, and it really does not make sense. It&#39;s full of clich√© situations, trite lines, melodrama, comedy ... whatever you want! <br /><br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can do anything convincing, and this movie is by no means an exception. All are delivered in a decent performance: Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But it is the Megastar who eclipses everyone with his imposing presence. Without it, this film would have been a game without beginning ... The story is about separation / mistaken identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good against evil: everything, seriously! Amitabh&#39;s is a brilliant performance in all aspects, in a movie that would otherwise be silly! And did I mention that it&#39;s ridiculously funny?']
