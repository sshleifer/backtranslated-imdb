I never attended a movie screening at midnight before "Dick Tracy" came out. <br /> <br /> I still have the "T-shirt ticket" I had to use to be admitted into the screening around here somewhere, and like that shirt, "Dick Tracy" has stayed with me ever since. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the film, the sharp images, the bright primary colors and the strong characters have undoubtedly been recorded in your brain. It is a marvel to contemplate. <br /> <br /> As director / protagonist / co-author / producer, Beatty knows what works in a movie and shows it here, taking a familiar American icon and recreating its entirety. new era. Still set in the 1930s, "Tracy" has a kind of timeless quality like all good movies. I've lost count of how many times I've seen "Tracy" and I keep detecting something new every time I do it. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is top-notch, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them), even Madonna's Breathless Mahoney is a relevancy in which, in the right environment, she can act (GASP!). <br /> <br /> But there are still topics such as the need for the family, staying true to oneself, exploring good against evil, even Machiavellian themes. Strange for a comic movie, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> In short, "Dick Tracy" is a classic in itself. In comparison to other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. It is a good and strong film that does not depend on blood, violence, blasphemy or nudity to make its point. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to be learned here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
