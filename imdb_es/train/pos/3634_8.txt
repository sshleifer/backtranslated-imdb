I had little expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something challenging for one night. I left the theater totally delighted and somewhat surprised. This is a very good baseball tribute movie, and a good lesson on how to pursue your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role, and his performance moved me. Definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple of hours of your time!
