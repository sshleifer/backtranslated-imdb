Some movies simply should not be redone. This is one of them. In itself it is not a bad movie. But it fails to capture the taste and terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast remains, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not give Luke the character the right feel. But the main flaw of this version is that it moved too far from the story of Shirley Jackson in his attempts to be great and lost some of the excitement of the previous movie in a trade for more dazzling special effects. Once again I will say that in itself it is not a bad movie. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the previous version much more.
