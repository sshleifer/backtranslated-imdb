When a crack with pneumonic plague appears (a variant of the bubonic plague), Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), an official of the US Public Health Service. UU., Immediately puts in quarantine all those who know that they were close to the body. Unfortunately, rigidity was achieved in that way when killed, and there is a good chance that the killer will begin to spread the plague, leading to an epidemic. Enter the police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is enlisted to locate the killer as soon as possible and avoid a possible national disaster. <br /> <br /> Although Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers from being a little out of focus and a bit too extended (my reason for lowering the score to an eight). Divert the genres from the Noirish gangster to medical disaster, police procedure, thriller and even romance. <br /> <br /> This is not the best work of the director Elia Kazan, but to say that it is a little false. Kazan is in charge of directing masterpieces such as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), after all. This movie is earlier than that, but Kazan said the studio had already "unleashed" it. Taking that freedom too far may partially explain the expansion. The film is set in New Orleans, a city where Kazan "used to walk ... day and night, so I knew it well". I wanted to exploit the environment. "It's fantastic and colorful, I wanted boats, steam engines, stores, jazz venues, all of New Orleans." <br /> <br /> Kazan handles every genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they could be better connected. The movie would have benefited by staying with only one or two of their moods. The expansion in terms of configuration would still have worked. Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by the writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some Like 'Em Cold." <br /> <br /> The gangster material, which ends firmly in the territory of the thriller with a long chase scene near the end of the movie, is probably the highlight. It is not surprising that Kazan has said that he believes that villains are "more colorful, anyway, I never had much affection for the good guys, I do not like Puritans." A close second is the only material that approaches the "panic" of the title: the discovery of the plague and the attempts to locate those exposed, inoculate them and contain the disease. While there is much suspense during these two "moods", much of the film is also a fairly simple drama, with the most typical rhythm of that genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in everything is excellent. The stylistic difference of many modern films could hardly be more pronounced. It is intelligent, delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character. The conflict is not created by "silly" decisions but by intelligent movements; The events and actions of the characters are more like a game of chess. When unusual positions are taken, such as Reed, who retains the plague of newspapers, he gives relatively long justifications for his decisions, which other characters argue. <br /> <br /> In light of this, it is interesting that Kazan believed that "Property, religion, ethics and the middle class are killing us". That idea finds its way into the film through alterations to the norm, or concessions away from it, made by the protagonists. For example, the main mobster Blackie (Jack Palance in his first role in the film) is offered a "Get out of prison for free" card if he collaborates in the fight against the plague. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are fine, if there is nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to look are the performances, the intriguing scenery and the well-written dialogue.
