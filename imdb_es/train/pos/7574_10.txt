['This is one of the best of the series, with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape). The game has a very good story in which you play as Claire Redfield in the search for her brother, Chris Redfield (who you probably know about the original Resident Evil). It is as scary as the other Resident Evil, and contains many more scenes. <br /><br /> My rating: **** of ***** Stars (Rating based on comparison with other video games)']
