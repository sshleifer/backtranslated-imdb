Contrary to what those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club offers real answers as well as inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical comments and a different view of what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think is better. Unlike other programs, which provide social and faith-related commentary, those behind the 700 Club provide help to those in need, such as feeding the hungry with Operation Blessing, providing medical assistance to those who live in communities affected by poverty and provide hope. To those who need hope. It is not hateful at all. If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest you take the remote control and turn the channel on your television. I do the same when I find CNN Headline News or, for that matter, programs that I find biased or offensive. What I find offensive is the way ABC Family inserts the disclaimer that the opinions of Club 700 do not reflect those of ABC Family.
