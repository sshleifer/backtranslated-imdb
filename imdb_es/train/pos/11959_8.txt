['Greetings again from the darkness. Remember all the &quot;What happened to Woody Allen?&quot; jokes Even Mr. Allen made fun of the fans who wanted him to continue making his own &quot;funny&quot; movies. As with any great artist, Mr. Allen&#39;s art evolved over the years and lost some fans while picking up others. Last year&#39;s masterpiece, &quot;Matchpoint,&quot; proved that it remains as relevant and moving as it was in the days of &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Manhattan.&quot; What impresses us most of the fans of more than 40 years is that New York itself seems to be in love with the homeland. Apparently, he really likes England !! While filming &quot;Matchpoint,&quot; Mr. Allen fell in love with Scarlett Johansson and his true spirit of life and sense of humor. This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years. Scarlett, although she risks overexposure, must be recognized not only for choosing films that throw her into a glamorous light. She is not afraid to look and act like a real person. In &quot;Scoop,&quot; she shows some comedy scenes on the screen and, in many scenes, offers the real blow to Allen&#39;s heterosexual man. Of course, every time Mr. Allen decides to stand in front of the camera, he will receive more than his share of a single line and social commentary, which is fine, because few do it better. <br /><br /> Very good support work from Ian McShane and Hugh Jackman. In fact, Mr. Jackman offers some insights into why many of us think he is the best option to replace Brosnan as the new Bond. As in most Allen movies, the star is the script, not the actors. Although Scarlett offers excellent results here and is a nice contrast to the polished Allen and Jackman, what makes this crack is the dialogue ... especially the jokes between Allen and Scarlett. If you&#39;re not a big fan of Woody&#39;s actors, do not be afraid. It limits your screen time and is quite effective, except in two or three short scenes that almost seem out of place. Another tradition of Woodman is a brilliant musical background and &quot;Scoop&quot; is no exception ... especially the composition of Strauss. <br /><br /> &quot;Scoop&quot; is a good cross between &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and the best of the films of Marx Brothers or the comedies of Cary Grant. Yes, it&#39;s a comedy for adults, but in reality it&#39;s very cute ... especially for a serial killer and a talking ghost comedy!']
