After all, you will not see an Orson Welles movie to see a simple and pretty little plot and a glitter of the image of a happy star forever. <br/> <br/> You will see theatrically intensified characters. Encased in a conflict against colorful and unusual configurations, illuminated and marked with imagination, photographed with bravery, and all sprinkled with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and more opaque director would avoid or not think in the first place. <br /> <br /> As usual, in addition to directing, Welles wrote the script and also played the hero. A young Irish sailor who had hit the world and seen his evil, but who still retained his trust in the goodness of others? Unfortunately for him, he placed his trust in Rita Hayworth, whose cold good looks hid a grim past and murderous inclinations for the future. She was married without love, with an impotent and crippled lawyer, acted like a malevolent lizard for the brilliant Everett Sloane. <br /> <br /> There is a youthful romanticism underlying all this, and this quality came into exuberant play in "The Lady of Shanghai". Before the inevitable happened, Welles escaped ?? To a last triangular confrontation in a hall of mirrors, which has become one of the classic scenes of post-war cinema? <br /> <br /> Welles did not miss an opportunity throughout the film to counteract the words and actions with visual details that enriched the texture and enhanced the atmosphere. His camera seemed almost to caress Rita Hayworth as the sun played with her hair and long limbs as she joked playfully with the young sailor towards her net.
