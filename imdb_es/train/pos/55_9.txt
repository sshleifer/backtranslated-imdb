['At first, I was not sure if I wanted to see this movie when it appeared in my guide, so I looked it up in IMDb and I thought the cover looked very good, so I thought I&#39;d try it out expecting a movie like Elephant. <br /><br /> Once I got over the fact that I&#39;m supposed to be upset by the excellent Alice character played by Busy Phillips, I realized the good job this movie was doing to establish the relationship between Alice and Deanna. Alicia is so bad with Deanna played by Erika Christensen for most of the movie, but we finally discovered that despite being polar opposites, they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting. They share the loneliness and to what extent it reveals itself as the film progresses. <br /><br /> I just have to say how much I loved this movie and I was glad to see all the positive comments about it. I could not even get through Elephant because he seemed to be exploiting the tragedy of Columbine. This film on the other hand was convincing and realistic. Busy Phillips acting is out of the chain! That&#39;s a good thing and I&#39;d love to see your progress in some more mature roles.']
