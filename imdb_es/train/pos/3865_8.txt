"Historias del siglo" was a half-hour series and appeared in the first edition of the television season '54 -'55. It was also the first Western television series to win an Emmy Award. Starring veteran western actor Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark, the series put Clark and his fellow railroad detectives (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams during the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" during the second half) against the historic western outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid-1860s to the early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to see and quite realistic due mainly to the carefree charm of Jim Davis in the main role. He seemed a true western character. Another note more. When Matt Clark arrived in the city after a long trip, he actually looked like he had been on a long horseback ride, as he would be covered in dust. <br /> <br /> A very good western for adults.
