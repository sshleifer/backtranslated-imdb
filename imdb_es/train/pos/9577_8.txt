Finally we have before us a Category III film for the summer season 2006. Made of the same cruelty, crime and passion, Dog Bite Dog benefits not only from an appropriate title, but also from a flexible direction, an excellent photography and respectable performances of the most involved. Of course, there has to be a trap, manifested here in the form of several obvious inconsistencies, but everything that is said DBD represents the mature spirit that we would love to see more in the mainstream of HK. <br /> <br /> It also marks the announced return of Edison Chen, absent since the initial D debacle a year ago. Chen's reserved machismo works wonders with the film, but it would have been difficult without Sam Lee, whose ability to alternate between physical comedy (Crazy 'N' the City, No Problem 2) and the lunatic threat has culminated in the most strong we've had 'I've seen him since Made in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Together, the duo makes Dog Bite Dog, and I hope that Edison has an easier rest from now on as a consequence: his touch transformed the projects of Princess D for the Infernal Affairs saga, and still It is still a rare case. <br /> <br /> Mainly at the beginning, DBD shows some fascinating images, playing magnificent tricks with light, shadow and perspective. The soundtrack increases this atmospheric effect, adding to the general unreal environment that the film offers. Much of the resulting combination probably has to do with writer Matt Chow, previously involved in the horrific Three Ends. Dog Bite Dog retains numerous features that are reminiscent of that project of terror, namely, deteriorated urban landscapes and an omnipresent air of something mysterious lurking just around the corner. <br /> <br /> Do not worry, this is not a horror movie, instead. a road traveled by the classic One Nite in Mongkok, although from a more perverse angle. Replacing the reluctant killer character of Daniel Wu, we have Edison, who plays an unnamed killing machine that comes from the Cambodian underworld. The way to execute a single target in Hong Kong, the almost silent killer takes care of business immediately after his arrival, a chilling process, courtesy of the film's brilliant visual effects. <br /> <br /> Although he was weaned from childhood to become a professional murderer, Edison's homonymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail, picked up by a CID team sent to investigate. This assembly has a good cameo from the acclaimed film actor Lam Suet and a good support from the television star Wayne Lai. However, the renegade officer of Sam Lee, Wai, heads the accusation and reveals himself as a highly disturbed individual but, nevertheless, an excellent policeman. Little by little we learn that Wai's inner conflict stems from the corruption record of his father's police, evoking the demons at hand in the relentless pursuit that ensues. . There is quite a quotient of violence in the store, despite the fact that the gore per se feels attenuated in some places, and the adult language only makes a symbolic appearance. Once again, there are no nudity, which leads one to conclude that the Cat III are delivered these days a bit hastily. Still, the DBD is a relatively mature theatrical release, and we applaud its arrival. <br /> <br /> Between the fight, the stabbing, the hacking and the shooting, even a career killer needs some romance, and just like Daniel Wu had Cecilia Cheung in One Nite, the intrepid Mr. Chen get a sweetie, done beautifully by the newcomer Pei Pei. His unidentified character (a lot of anonymity in this) meets Edison in a strangely abandoned dump, abused by his father to the point of repulsive madness and longing to escape. When the killer leaves HK, he agrees to take her with him, and they go together to run, love blooms along the way. While the film does not stop at things that make a lot of love, our hearts are with the tragic character of Pei Pei and her infinite suffering. She interprets the timid but courageous protagonist surprisingly well, establishing that there are no good or bad guys here, as the extremely instructive ending demonstrates. <br /> <br /> Director Cheang Soi's portfolio includes the recent thriller of suspense Home Sweet Home and Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, two numbers probably exceeded in most accounts by the sinister behavior of Dog Bite Dog. Cheang manages to keep the DBD flowing along, and considering the many parts at stake here, he faces critical standards erected by people like Johnny To in his nighttime epic from the La Mission basin. There have been a couple of failures, for example, Edison miraculously shrugged a chest shot, but these are highly forgivable. <br /> <br /> Mark triumphant results for two young and talented artists of the kind that Hong Kong needs if we want the heyday of the city film to come back, Dog Bite Dog is not known for its history. Its strong is based on strong representations and style, driven by the strength of the theater's muscle and a sharp eye for visual and auditory delicacy. <br /> <br /> HK has a long tradition of stories that have to do with time. night alter-ego of the city, something that Dog Bite Dog defends with love, which amounts to a solid career if it is not an absolute masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
