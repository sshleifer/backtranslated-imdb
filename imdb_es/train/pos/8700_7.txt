This movie has great style, fantastic images and sex scenes with a beautiful woman. It wobbles at the end as the twists in the story become a bit extreme ... but overall, I would recommend this movie just because it has that good old Russian feeling ... big, awesome, powerful, grim and brutal, and at the same time beautiful in the ancient tradition of tragic beauty. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A guy who can make a leaf shoot out of his hand at will (not a spoiler, since they show him in the trailer) when he is really angry with you he tries to have a girlfriend .. He discovers that after you kill a person with the hand of your sword, it is a bit difficult to maintain a stable relationship ... <br /> <br /> The sword guy is on the planet for a reason. .. he just does not know what is STILL. <br /> <br /> <br /> A lot of dark street fights with guys who unexpectedly fill up creatively. <br /> <br /> RUSSAIN w Subtitles ENG .. Slick worth watching ..
