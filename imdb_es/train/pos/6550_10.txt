Look, if you were interested in a book by Nancy Drew, what you would do would be to pick up a book and read it. I am not. Since I can remember I read the people who were tearing up movies because it was not like the book. I'm sorry, in the digital age we can no longer watch movies in animated books, however, I'm sure you can still find some short silent movies in the form of a book. When The Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third one won an Oscar: "The book was better". When I saw A Kill a Mockingbird, "the book was better." Now, a lot of people are upset, once again, because Nancy Drew was not like the book. I'm not saying that Nancy Drew is going to win any Oscars, in any case, it will be one of those Nickelodeon Blicks or Kids Choice Awards. I'm saying give the movie a break. It's film, not paper. As a movie, I found Nancy Drew very nice, with the cameos of Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and supporting roles with Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper in the O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). This is the first time I see Emma Roberts in a movie and, frankly, I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and Eric; his character remains constant throughout the film and reacts well with the conflict. A cheerful film in the spirit of Harriet the spy is pleasant from time to time. <br /> <br /> I give it ten stars because I really enjoyed the movie, I'd love to see it again and I'll probably buy it on a DVD. launching.
