When I was young I had seen very few movies. My parents in all their wisdom rented this. I distrusted much of what the film was about, in fact I was not even allowed to see it. My brother and my sister arrived, of course, and this angered me a lot. So what did I do? Late in the night I shattered the VCR! He kicked the TV screen and called the police and denounced the vandals. They arrested me, of course, I could not get my foot out of the television before the police arrived. They just gave me a stern conversation and sent me home. My parents punished me, of course, and they made me work to pay off the debt of the TV and the VCR. This ruined me, slave work really sucks believe me, but I had to. Tasks throughout the house. What happened in the end? We have a big screen TV, a DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did I get the money? Easy, I made my own movies and sold them to Disney. Do you remember finding Neno? Well, I wrote that movie and I filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks. Of course, they rewrote the plot and they did it in CGI because they could not afford to turn it into a real-life action image like I had! In the end, I never saw the movie The Head that did not die and the rating I gave it is the one of my life. He is doing quite well!
