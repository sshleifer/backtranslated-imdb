Writer / director John Hughes covered all the bases (as usual) with this family movie "Sunday afternoon". "Curly Sue" is a sweet and precocious orphan, taken care of since childhood by "Bill". The two live carefree while traveling through the large United States area of ​​A. Fate combines them with a yuppie lawyer "very nice", and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this movie, since it can be related to the heroine, played by 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who became the girl of the Pepsi commercials). It is assumed that the character is approximately 6 or 7 years old, since it is recommended that he think about going to school. Part of her vocabulary suggests that she has every day of 9 years or more. <br /> <br /> Similar to "Alone at home", there are quite a few sticks and small fists that strike big fat chins. Once again, it is about making a film "formula", aimed at a young audience. Entertaining and comforting. Do not look for surprises, but be prepared to shed a tear or two.
