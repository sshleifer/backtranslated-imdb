I could not agree more with the comments of Nomad 7 and I A HVR. A perfect relaxed movie on Sunday morning. The humor is subtle (exactly the opposite of "slapstick" as pointed out by a wrong commentator). <br /> <br /> But what always ceases to amaze me is the frequency with which I want to return to this movie over and over again. Originally I copied this movie on VHS about 12 years ago, when it debuted on one of those free weekend previews of Pay Cable (maybe HBO?). I had never heard of that previously. I do not know why it was not marketed so well. ?? When the DVDs were released en masse, it was one of the first movies I replaced. A great combination of cast and writing. Also, the fall of Montana nature does not hurt things either (beautiful). <br /> <br /> It's probably not the kind of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If Adam Sandler-type things are in your alley, this is probably not your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. Most of the humor is in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I think my next visit will probably be on the 12th. But I still know that when he arrives at the scenes like where the police cars start to explode, I'll lose him (Ed O'Neill's face is priceless!). Recommended 110%.
