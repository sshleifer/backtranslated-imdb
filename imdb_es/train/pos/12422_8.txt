With the mixed reviews, this I did not expect too much and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a film of small crimes very entertaining with interesting characters, excellent portraits, a vivid writing without being simplistic and a good rhythm. It looks good too, in a funky way. Apparently people like this movie or just hate it, and I like it.
