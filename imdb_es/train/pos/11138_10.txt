Midnight cowboy is not for everyone. It is crude, painful and realistic but very entertaining. The main actors, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who would become Oscar-winning actors, will offer incredible performances. Like the Texas con man, Joe Buck, who migrates from the small city of Texas to the city of New York to become a con man. He does not apologize for his chosen profession, but it is not so easy. The women of New York City as the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass played by Oscar nominee Sylvia Miles are different from the women of Texas. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White, who died in 1969 of cancer. The locations in New York City are wonderful to see, as is the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and the characters of Buck, which evolve into a friendship between men. Men struggle to survive the life of New York City by not following the rules like getting a real job. As the film evolves, Buck's past comes to the surface and is disturbing but not clear. The movie is not for children, but compared to movies and television programming today, Midnight Cowboy could be more docile. I can not forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party that you can not forget. It's also a tear in a movie, so take out your handkerchiefs too.
