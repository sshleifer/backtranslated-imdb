But the rest of us, who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a block so that you cry ... enjoy! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick, a mentally slow war man who loves professional wrestling and his brother Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and works long hours. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone most of the time and tends to make questionable judgments. He really just wants to be a good boy, do the right thing and make his brother feel proud of him. He stops at the church to pray at a given moment and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character makes you cry before the damn movie even starts. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give away anything here, but the film is extremely involving, sad and heartbreaking. Those who do not fear these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, their love characters and a great song that I can not cite here, that has nothing to do with the movie, but it is strangely appropriate ... but you listen to it in a bar . <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie, since it was for 'Amadeus', I thought that could give him the chance to win. There is no such luck. Liotta is equally good but has less emotional impact, but then it does. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does not have a lot of paper here, but it was very kind of her to lend her name to a little drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers that she will never forget.
