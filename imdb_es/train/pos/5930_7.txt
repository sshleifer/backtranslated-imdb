The monstrous mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks the vital force of the virgins, and their most recent target is the beautiful but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratches ... I've never been a fan of bestsellers best-selling and overrated as King, Koontz or Barker, but this B movie, written by Mr. Dung himself, is not that bad how could it be be. Yes, sometimes it's amazingly atrocious, but in reality there are some amazingly impressive touches: a good old cemetery, a mysterious soundtrack and a gothic house scene by candlelight, a mirror that shows the monstrous form of the villains, etc. Of course, the film is tainted by Mr. Dung's disheveled speech and the obsession with toilet seat tactics for vilifying fat people, leading to a completely useless sub-plot of rap master. But there are roses among the manure.
