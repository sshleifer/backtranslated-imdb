['Those who involved the film camera so early in the century should have discovered something of their potential very soon. This is a good story of a playboy guy who needs money and, without realizing it, sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is his double and must confront him frequently, destroying his life. There are some wonderful scenes with people disappearing and, of course, the scenes in which the two are on stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit boring, but the story of Faust is always in the mind of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the lack of general appeal of the people in the movie. In addition, they practically shied away from a lot of action that would at least have given the thing some life. The first time I heard about this movie was about 25 years ago and I was finally able to see it. I was not disappointed.']
