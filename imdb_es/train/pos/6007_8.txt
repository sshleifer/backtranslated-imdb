If you have not heard about this Walt Disney Pictures movie, do not worry about that. It would be classified throughout the other Disney films intended for educational purposes as "Family Planning". <br /> <br /> Co-produced with Kotex to teach preadolescent girls about menstruation, supposedly. It only educates at a superficial level, so it does not go into heavy details for the animated sequence "Ram's Head" / Reproductive System. <br /> <br /> The film shows elements of "The Wonderful World of Disney" like turning the page and the use of animation to tell the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to find, so if you can find the movie, the best luck for you and enjoy.
