To those who say that this film deserves something below the implacable grace it showed, I do not agree. This is an incredible documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this movie. I beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made. The value it took to shoot this movie is the most remarkable. We find that the two brothers split when that moment happened. They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own safety and that of others. Judging if it is more noble to record a video of that tragedy or save lives as those amazing and incredible firemen did is not mine to answer. I only know that in 30 years, a class full of children will not know one without the other. <br /> <br /> I present 10 wholeheartedly. That's why the art of filming was created! Capture the natural emotion that real life offers. You can keep your garbage kung fu. The romance is cute. The action will never reach this level. This movie, 9/11, will be timeless in the sense that it did not glorify itself. I did not have an advance. I did not have all the flagrant vanities that a large part of the many movies on the many screens rang. He had class, composure, substance, and a record of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. He talked about things unavoidable for the camera's eye. Consider this film, as it proclaims to itself, a touching homage to all who fell for the beautiful and free name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give something less to a film that shows, does not embellish, the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times. I love "The Godfather", but "9/11" is forever a different type of film, since now it's a different world. It is art without question or question. <br /> <br /> jf
