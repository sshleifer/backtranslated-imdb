The fascist director, Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who aims at expert photographer Dean Cundy as if she were ten feet tall) has a plan to make it completely square. Complications that challenge that goal arise in the charming rock'n'roller Riff Randell (PJ Soles who lights up the screen, also has a hot body) who is an obsessive fan of the punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose big-framed glasses and nerd paper can not hide her stunning beauty) joins Riff to end the supposed crisis of killing rock and roll for good, which is the mission desired by Togar . <Br /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role as Tom Roberts, a success in everything, but having sex. Kate is crazy about Tom ... if only he could get his head out of the sand and see her. Clint Howard steals the film almost (honestly, who can steal this movie from Soles?) Like Eaglebauer, "the provider" that can make everyone get almost anything. Your office is located in the child's bathroom! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff's when he enjoys a concert by THE RAMONES. <br /> <br /> A noisy high school game that defies all the rules of normality ... and I loved it. It's as if someone simply said, "Let's make life fun for 1Â½ hours." The movie really is anarchy ... a chaos without plot that loves THE RAMONES with love with all their heart (even if they are horrible actors, they have the opportunity to win new audiences with this movie). <br /> <br /> The final practically sums up the film as a whole ... Riff and his classmates take over the high school and a big party begins. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! Not conventional by any means at all, this movie just lost the frenzy. Accompanied by a great rock soundtrack with some of the best songs of THE RAMONES, this film allows the viewer to accept a moment in life in which the war did not dominate the headlines and people had a good time. Those, I suppose, were the days.
