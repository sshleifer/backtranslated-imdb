First, let me say that I did not like the fact that The Rock won the title that is so gay. Next, I feel that Regal should have regained his European title, Jeff Hardy is a shitty champion. Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title for too long and Brock should have won it. I am satisfied with Storm and Christian as tag champions, the best match was Booker T and Big Show in my opinion.
