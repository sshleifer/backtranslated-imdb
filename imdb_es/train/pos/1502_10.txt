The great Robert Bloch (author of PSYCHO, for those of you who were not paying attention) wrote this horror story and it was one of the most terrifying movies I've seen as a child. (I had to walk THOUSAND just to see a movie, and it was usually dark when I left the theater, watching a horror movie was always disconcerting, but especially when it was as well executed as this one). The opportunity to see this several years ago on a videotape (which should always be a last resort), I was surprised at how well it remained. Do the horror test: look at it in the night, alone, and then tell me it's not scary ...
