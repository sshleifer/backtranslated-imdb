Okay, I know I should not like this movie but I do. From Pat Morita's lovely interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno's annoying cry, I laughed throughout this movie. While you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, it is a good movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is Morita talking to his boss in Tokyo while he drinks a second.
