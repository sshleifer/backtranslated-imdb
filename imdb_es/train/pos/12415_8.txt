This was obviously the prototype of Mick Dundee, but 'The Adventures of Barry McKenzie is more fun. I had a lot of fun and I laughed out loud many times. A fabulous central performance by Barry Crocker in the lead role, an Australian who invades England to displease the poms with their rude and free forms. Few Britons will be bothered by Barry's frequent and cruel remarks about his hosts. The relationship between the two countries is thorny but friendly and this stands out in the final line of the film, delivered by a somewhat reluctant McKenzie when boarding the plane back home. "I was starting to like the poms."
