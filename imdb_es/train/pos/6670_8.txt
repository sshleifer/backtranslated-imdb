There are many problems with Mystery Men. First, there are too many different characters to give them complex or even interesting personalities. Special effects detract from the story and are not really that special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a pathetic and youthful role as a character who simply tires and speaks with an inaudible accent. <br /> <br /> Now in the decent parts. William H Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as the shoveler is perfect. The Sphinx is an exceptionally funny character that is only mysterious and simply emits traditional mystical proverbs. Ben Stiller is also very funny and shows a weak character trying to become the big superhero leagues. All the characters do it, and that's an area that I found particularly ironic. This is because all the actors are indie film actors who try to enter the big leagues of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the reason I thought it failed at the box office is that the United States does not. I do not like irony. <br /> <br /> In general, I loved the movie, but I think it would have worked better if more effort had been put into adjusting the script instead of having unnecessary CGI landscapes and effects.
