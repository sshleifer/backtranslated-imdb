['This series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. Brings the book to life and gives even more meaning to the author&#39;s later work, * Collapse *. <br /><br /> Diamond himself appears as a nice and caring person, not just as a disinterested or disconnected academic. This series makes it clear that his book was not only a response to the need to &quot;publish or perish&quot;, as the saying about academic reality says, but it is a profoundly considered response to a question from someone he respects: A lot of cargo, and we have so little? As he respected the intelligence of the interrogator and his community, Diamond sought an answer that would not insult that intelligence or that community. I like to think about his answer in a very simple way, with the same spirit as &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Blame Canada&quot;: &quot;Blame the wheat!&quot;']
