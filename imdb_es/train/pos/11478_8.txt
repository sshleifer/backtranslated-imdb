Chris and Andre are two average, normal teenagers. Misunderstood by some and chosen by others. But together they stand up and everyone will pay. Together they form "The army of two". They plan and plan "Day Zero". That day is when they decide to storm their high school and, inevitably, kill 14 people in cold blood. When told through the tapes that made "Zero Day," it is just a fictional narrative of the Columbine tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of those movies that get in your head afterwards. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do such a good job that their characters look like almost any marginalized teenager who walks down the street. Their performances were very credible, you liked these guys and that was scary. Filmed on video almost entirely from the perspective of teenagers, "Zero Day" feels very real and authentic, as if you were there. These children try to rationalize their actions to the spectator and the actors sell it to them. But keep in mind that the tragedy continues from beginning to end and the end makes it surprising and uncomfortable for some.
