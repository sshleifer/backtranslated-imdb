I saw it a few years ago. I remembered it as very mysterious situations, and a mixture of melancholy things, such as Dorothy's destiny and Bogdanovich's personal future. <br /> <br /> I turn to see my copy of VHS and then I checked it more. and more. Today I am waiting for the DVD version, at any price, please! <br /> <br /> Country music and easy listening is very well chosen from the first second, a little blue, but also happy. <Br /> <br /> All the characters are great for me, with funny situations, great acting and many dialogues that have made me a cult movie for me and many people I met on the Internet or in film clubs. This may not be coincidental. <br /> <br /> I think the title is a hope for life! You have to be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know this may be a particular comment for the movie, but the fact is that I like it a lot, I think that movie marked me and I will never forget it.
