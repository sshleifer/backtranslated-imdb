['From the beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is possibly the most fun I&#39;ve seen in a movie. I immediately bought one for my bedroom this September. <br /><br /> All the elements united in this movie so beautifully. It is not often to see a movie with so many jokes about the penis, the homosexuals and the races so praised by the critics. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver every lascivious joke sensationally. Carell stays sweet throughout the entire film, where at the end of the movie you are encouraging him to succeed in their relationship more than you are to lie down. The cast is brutal, each of them has some problems with the ladies themselves. <br /><br /> One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we received. This is what makes a film easy to remember fondly. This movie will often be mentioned when the words &quot;hair removal&quot; and &quot;condoms&quot; are mentioned in the conversation. <br /><br /> When I saw him in the theater, I was surprised by how many older people were there to see him. I saw a group of four women enter in the mid-60s. Despite a larger audience, this movie still filled the whole theater with laughter. <br /><br /> I think the kind of people you&#39;re going to like are Office fans and Steve Carell. Many of the jokes remind me of the kind of jokes you would also see in Family Guy. The film is shallow enough for teenage children and still sweet and smart enough for middle-aged women. <br /><br /> I do not recommend going to this movie if you are not a fan of bad words or if you are easily offended. However, when you are in the movie, remember that this movie is in a good mood. The jokes are not &quot;gay jokes&quot;, they are just jokes. And they are fun.']
