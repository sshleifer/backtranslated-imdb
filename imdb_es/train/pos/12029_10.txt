I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorites and one of the cutest actors of all time. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I have seen most of his films, but all of Jeremy Jordan. What I do not like about Twisted Desire is when "Nick" is arrested and "Jennifer" shakes him. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
