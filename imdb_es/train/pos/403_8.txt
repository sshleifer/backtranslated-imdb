I remember that the Legend of Zu trailer was quite impressive and as a fan of A Man Called Hero (my favorite of all time), Storm Riders decided that I should watch this too. I know there's a lot of criticism about Ekin Cheng's acting ability everywhere, but so far it's my favorite Hong Kong movie movie (much better than Nicolas Tse) and it's one of the factors that I enjoyed in this movie. Undoubtedly, this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was generated by computer at the end of this movie. They must have put a lot of work into this and they deserve a good credit for that. The story of the film was a fairy tale between good and evil with a love story (I guess Ekin Cheng attracts girls with ease). The story is not very intellectual and deep, but it is not what you expect when you watch an action movie. I wished there was more martial arts action with fists and fists instead of battles with magical abilities, but hey, that's life and it never goes the way you want. And why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle across the sky at the end? That is too funny. Legend of Zu can not be a man called a hero in my eyes, but it flows like a video game and that's not bad at all. If a company decides to publish games in this film, I will not be surprised, since it contains all the elements of video games. Good job. Please, make more fantasy movies like this one.
