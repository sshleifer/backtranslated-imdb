Being someone who lists Night of the Living Dead in the number three of his five best favorite films of all time, and while he adores this student film parody, I feel that I must defend this film against the biting criticism previously published. This brief but sweet work has always liked the marathons of horror movies and science fiction where those who attend have a love for the genre but they know that zombie movies should not be taken too seriously. This movie is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It's meant to be fun, and many others whom I've heard singing and applauding agree with me that it's successful. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD more than 50 times. Watch for the director's cameo as the news reporter Jeff Drexel, and also if he has the opportunity to capture his parody of Alien, Loaf.
