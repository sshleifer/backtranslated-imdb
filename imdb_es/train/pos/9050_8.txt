This is a jewel, a true piece of Americana for all that this implies. If you are self-programmed to resist the "life-affirming" stories, simply stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe. And what makes the cake glaze really delicious is that it is based on a true story of wealth, it is not necessary to select the details that were changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the best living actors, and the good complex, self-conflicting, good for the central father who portrayed could only be carried out successfully by someone with his skill and knowledge. Simple-minded comments, which refuse to accept a parent who tries to enforce the law while feeling that it may be out of place, expose the commentator's limitation, not writers or performance. This is not for the cynics, or the simple minded.
