I could not believe the low score of 5.6 on IMDb about Johnny Dangerously at the time I wrote this review and thought I had to do something to promote that memorable piece of comedy as much as I can. Seriously, to get such a low rating, the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very superficial open mind. If you do not like comic movies, do not look at them! Combining absurd humor, a very good narration and an extraordinary rhythm given by the multiple gags that are executed, this movie has been introduced in my DVD collection. And that's not to mention the visual farces integrated here and there and, of course, the use of "clin d'oeils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite movies of organized crime. <br /> <br /> I showed this movie to a lot of people and, being presented without any specific expectation (except maybe watching a comedy): the mental state in which I should see any movie in my opinion. - They all liked it a lot. It's going well, it's not long to see and there's absolutely no deceleration in the evolution of the story, which I think is very simple. Of course it's not perfect, some gags fall short, but no movie is perfect, especially when considering other opinions that are yours. That's why I rated this film with 9 out of 10. This movie is, in my opinion, a precursor to "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well-thought-out comedies. What is now increasingly absurd while reducing thought and ingenuity. Sometimes, gags need more culture than many people imagine to be understood correctly, in any case. As a last word, I would like to say: look at it for yourself, do not follow Joe's average saying and if you do not like it, you will know that it was not good for your tastes, which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion
