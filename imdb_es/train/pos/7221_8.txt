Every time you think you have a Deathtrap control, another twist appears in the plot. The best thing is to just sit back and enjoy the trip in this. This movie has a lot more to recommend. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine, Michael Jackson, known mainly for his screen kiss between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (unfortunately, was cut from the televised version I saw).) He is a very unhappy man. Once he was a successful playwright, his last several works on Broadway have failed. And while his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is no more than a support, both in the monetary and emotional sense, this does little to make Sidney feel better. To add insult to injury, the young playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), has just sent a play to Sydney for him to see. It's Anderson's first, and Sidney can see that the young man is a talented writer. He jokingly tells his wife that he should invite Anderson, kill him and present the work as his own. She laughs with him at first, but when Sidney invites Anderson to dinner, he worries that he is really putting his plan into practice. And your fears can be justified ... <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant script. There are twists and turns throughout the plot, and they become faster and more furious as you get closer to the end. It's the kind of movie that has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning and it keeps you there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Caine offers his usual excellent performance, and he exhibits a special ability to play cultured, refined and intellectual men. Reeve also offers an excellent representation of a man who does not have eyes as open or innocent as he seems. Cannon's frantic works well for Myra. And Irene Worth offers a good performance as a nosy neighbor who is also psychic. <br /> <br /> This is a film with an ending that I would never expect, and repeated sightings help detect things that were previously lost. viewings An anonymous classic that, unfortunately, is only remembered in a scene that altered some sensibilities at that moment, and that is a real pity.
