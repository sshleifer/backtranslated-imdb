A large Bugs Bunny caricature of the previous years has Bugs as an artist in a shop window in a local store. After the day ends, the manager comes in to tell you that he will be transferred soon. Bugs is pleased to convince him that he realizes that the new job is in taxidermy ... and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals. The animals like, for example, a certain rabbit. This causes a battle of wit between the rogue rabbit and his now former employer. I discovered that this short was charming and definitely one of the best of the early forties. It's still so much fun almost 60 years later. This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 2. <br /> <br /> My rating: A-
