His plan is to violate it, but he manages to escape. The man has his bag. The police can not help her, since the real violation did not happen. Then, one day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, their attacker arrives there. His name is Joe. A long battle against this man begins. But then she manages to spray her eyes and mouth with insect repellent, things that will kill her if she does not get help soon. She ties him up and makes Joe the same subject of physical and mental aggressions as him. used previously. The Extremities (1986) is directed by Robert M. Young. It is based on the controversial 1982 off-Broadway play by William Mastrosimone. Farrah Fawcett, who unfortunately lost her battle with cancer last year, is fantastic as Marjorie. .James Russo, who played the attacker also in the play, is convincing as Joe. Alfre Woodard and Dia Na Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as a Security Guard. He earned a Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you. The question is whether revenge is justified. It is not a perfect movie. , but I recommend it.
