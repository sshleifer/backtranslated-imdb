I have been reading some of the comments from other users and decided to include one as well. Some of the users are trapped in a kind of "realistic" mentality. This movie was meant to be a "fantasy" ... a "what if" a funny movie. It was never to be "real" or serious. It was very nice for everyone I met when it happened, although despite the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 years old at the time and I totally enjoyed it. My little son also loved it! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she also loved it. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that should be enjoyed just for that: fun. All the "realists" in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. I'm so sorry for those young people who watched this movie first and then they could go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg Air Base in California); They must have expected to find the same kind of environment that was described in The Movie and then they felt 'disappointed' ... I guess their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh good. If you love fantasy movies and you have not seen them, I recommend it! Enjoy!
