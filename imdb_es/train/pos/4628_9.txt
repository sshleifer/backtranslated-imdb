One of the best parts of Sundance is watching movies that would almost certainly be lost otherwise. Unless you are a true devotee of art houses, you probably do not get many documentaries. Only a few achieve a recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Each year a group of prisoners presents a play by Shakespeare. The director Hank Rogerson and his team follow the troupe, since the roles are self-selected, interpreted, rehearsed and ultimately carried out. <br /> <br /> The film is full of fascinating revelations for those of us who have not been exposed to the prison environment. Despite the labels we know them (convicts, criminals, murderers, etc.), we soon begin to appreciate and respect these men as human beings with feelings of thought. Coincidentally, the work chosen for the year of filming was The Tempest, with a pervasive focus on forgiveness and redemption. All the actors deal with the relevance of the work for their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama. <br /> <br /> For a documentary film, like a book, the best that can be done. What is expected is that we experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal revelation for me. "Oh brave new world, you have such creatures in him."
