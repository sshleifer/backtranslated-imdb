My name is Heather and I am the girl whose story is based on this movie. I want to thank all of you who watched this movie and enjoyed it. As tough and tough as some of the things described in this movie, they do not even come close to describing how bad things really were. Not to mention the effect that everything had on my mother and my little sister. thanks again for the excellent comments that everyone had, I really appreciate them <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mother. It is hard to believe that so many years have passed since this film was made. Even harder to believe that people were still seeing him a year ago. For any of you who have gone through a similar or similar situation, keep in mind that there are people here in cyberspace who do fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you.
