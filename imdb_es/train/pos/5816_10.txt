The first time I saw this "movie" I loved it. When I was 11 years old, I was more interested in music and dance. As I grew up, I also became more interested in acting. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still entertaining to watch. The sequence of "Badder" could have been left out, although the children were quite good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were fun, especially when the police officer tells Michael: "I need your autograph right here," after stopping him to dance in an area where there is no dancing. But it is "Smooth Criminal" which is the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did an excellent job as the tough guy (and that hair was wild). The dance is perfect, and so are the special effects. The only thing he could have done without the spiders. Any fan of Michael should see this, if you have not already done so. I give it a 10+!
