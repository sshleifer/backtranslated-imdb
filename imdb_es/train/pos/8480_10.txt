Thanks to Warner Archive, once again I can see this gigantic variety show that throws everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however, is present). This film grants screen time to all the people who were under contract with Warner at that time. If some of the artists seem unknown to some, it is because they were great in the days of silence and vanished with the popularity of the fans. There are also some really remarkable artists from the vaudeville era. You will be very impressed with Winnie Lightner, who makes two numbers. There is also that French star, Irene Bordoni, who sings a love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the highlights is Technicolor's "Chinese Fantasy" in two bands that has been restored for this version. It is really beautiful and stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the massive "Lady Luck" ending that lasts for almost a quarter of an hour. This is truly an epic of the era of the first talkies. Any fan of the old movie will love this.
