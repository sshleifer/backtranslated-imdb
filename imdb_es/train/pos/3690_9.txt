Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave all people the ability to love the whole world, but since the human heart is very small, each person has that special place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most outstanding directors of today when they set out to profess eternal love for that special place and to represent situations in the lives of its inhabitants and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us to an impressive walk through the Parisian districts, human feelings, longings and expectations. <Br /> <br /> Always some other quarter, always some completely moving story about ordinary people looking for love, whether in a parking lot, art studio, subway station. And Paris je t'aime is about a great variety of loves: love for the couple, son, father, for those who meant the world to us but who no longer exist, a love that needs to be revived, a fortuitous love for that stranger when their eyes meet. Or the love that simply is not meant to be ... today, but tomorrow, who knows? <br /> <br /> However, this film is not just about love, but about life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion. , daily ups and downs. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not at all soppy, but rather warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 9 because the final section suggests how some of the stories could be developed further, but not all of them and that's what I think is missing, and by "further development" I do not mean any specific reference to the future of the characters. As for everything else, I can only say: captivating. It makes you want to leave everything behind, flee to Paris and live those little romances yourself.
