On December 28, 1895, at the Grand Café in Paris, the history of cinema wrote to itself, while Louis Lumière showed his short films, all of them unique, to a paying audience. 'La Sortie des Usines Lumière' was the first film that was played and I would like to be there, not only to see the film, but also the reactions of the audience. <br /> <br /> We start with the closed doors of the Lumière factory. Apparently, since the image looks like a photograph, people thought they were just going to see a slide show, not something they expected. But then the doors open and people run away, heading home. First many women, then some men and a man on a bicycle with a big dog. When everyone is outside, the doors close again. <br /> <br /> Whether this is the first film or not (some say that 'L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat' was the first film that Lumière recorded), It is an impressive piece of early cinema. Being bored by this is almost impossible for multiple reasons. One simple reason: it's only fifty seconds long. But also for people who usually only like special effects films, there must be something interesting here; You can not see historical things like this every day.
