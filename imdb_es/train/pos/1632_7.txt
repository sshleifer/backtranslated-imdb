Misfits in a military school? Hmmmm, sounds fun, maybe offensive to some. You have the characters there, the Arab thief, the crazy teenager of sex, the smart mouth, the marijuana smoker, and you must not forget the guy who burns things. Add Sergent, a homosexual Sergent and a sexy ammo master, and make a crazy movie adventure. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie and it's fun, because the comedy revolves around the fact. that if they try to work together, things are done. <br /> <br /> This gang of misfit students at the Weinberg Military School has been placed here because, as Sergeant Liceman cites, "because they are outcasts, shame on their families, and communities, the unfortunates." One of Ralph Macchio's previous performances before Karate Kid and My Cousin Vinny, with appearances by Barbara Bach as well, this film attracts teenagers and young adults. <br /> <br /> The great soundtrack keeps the movie moving.
