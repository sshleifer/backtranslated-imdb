What a relief to discover that I am not imagining this program! The taxi driver's summary is great. I also remember having found it disturbing and not especially to see as a family, I should have been 10/11 by the time I saw it. I think that for a girl of that age, part of the attraction was the very blond hair of the lead and its state of permanent sadness. The theme was played on a flute that I remember, although I can not remember how it was. I think the introduction showed him playing it, or maybe he played a flute on the show and especially when he was sad? Maybe it's never meant to know how it ended, to see the clip or to listen to the melody, but at least now I know it's not just me.
