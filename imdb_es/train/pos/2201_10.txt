['I just finished watching the 1st album in a 4 disc collection (26 episodes) created in conjunction with the UCLA Film and Television Archive (S&#39;More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (apart from the first episode), the quality of the image is quite good. The DVD box is shown on the title page here in IMDb. <br /><br /> &quot;Mr. Peepers&quot; is as charming as when I saw him for the first time (5 years at that time) and Wally Cox is really endearing in this role. If you&#39;re in the mood for a quiet comedy that stalks you, instead of hitting you in the head, you&#39;ll treasure this opportunity to experience all the wonderful characters you can remember from your childhood. Although some of the gags are a little cheesy, most are ingenious and well executed ... and even the cheesy ones are fun. This is a television series that honors my earliest memories of childhood.']
