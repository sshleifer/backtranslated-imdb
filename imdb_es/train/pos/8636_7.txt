A thriller with stars Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a trip to the west. The last couple is investigating notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer on the street (without Dave's knowledge) and Juliette is his poor companion. This is a good cast and the story progresses, but Pitt does not have a credible fear as a serial killer, although it is one of his best previous roles. The best thing is that here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, either in his roles in 'Homicide: Life on the Street' or in the short series 'Wonderland'. <br /> <br /> Vote: 6
