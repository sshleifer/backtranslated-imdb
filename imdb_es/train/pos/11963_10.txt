"Scoop" is easily Woody Allen's funniest movie from the 2000s until now. Allen, although he finally seems to be his age, is at the top of his game as the wizard Sidney Waterman. His phrases and behavior are very funny. Do not let critics influence your opinion. "Scoop" is a top-notch "Woody-Lite" image. <br /> <br /> Classical music is an excellent complement to on-screen action. Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful in that swimsuit. Jackman is running. The cinematography lights up. "Scoop" is a wonderful escapist meal from start to finish. The last shot of the movie is only worth the price of admission.
