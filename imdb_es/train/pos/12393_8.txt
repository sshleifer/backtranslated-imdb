For those who were interested in knowing exactly how humanity came to be enclosed in large red pods that make me want a pomegranate, is the duo of the shorts of the "Second Renaissance". I am not exactly sure why they are divided into two parts, especially because they are accredited as one on the DVD (and these shorts are seen in any other format but the DVD?), But they are informative even if they have some gaps. <br /> <br /> What really makes this first part stand out, the second part and the rest of the animations, is the parallel that shows between the rise of robots and civil rights. Graphic tributes to slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the March of the Million Men and the divine complex of humanity. In fact, these shorts never refer to "God", instead of being replaced by "Image of man". <br /> <br /> As for the shorts of the collection, "The Second Renaissance: Part I" is By far the most effective to draw emotion. It is a painful and disturbing vision of the potential of humanity to become "the architect of its own destruction". Some can be deactivated by some of the concepts that stem directly from the previously established science fiction literature, but, again, that is basically what most of the Matrix series have done, and has been a driving force behind it. your success. <Br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
