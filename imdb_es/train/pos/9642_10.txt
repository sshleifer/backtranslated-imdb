The movie is very realistic. Absolutely, it does not belong to the Hollywood film genre where each line must be pronounced in a perfect way and where every movement is precise. The actors who play the roles of the lovers do a GREAT job representing the feelings and thoughts of the characters, their adventures of everyday life. In general, the film culminates the viewer in a state of depression. This is where the realism of the whole story is evident. Not everything happens the way we think should happen. Although I can say that the film does not end with a bad grade. We look, we learn, we experience ourselves. That is probably the moral of this story.
