The latest installment of the action thriller franchise is probably the most shocking of the three films. It goes further by touching the anti-bond theme. Bourne does not like what he's doing and wants to know about his fuzzy past. Everything about this film hits him from cinematography to choreography, acrobatics, screenplay and acting. <br /> <br /> The movie starts suddenly when Bourne flees from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the first movie stopped. Or does it? The weather is a bit confusing here, but we understand the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean up almost catches him, but he succeeds and does not kill anyone. They are not your goal. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect him at all costs. Pamela Landy is back, as is Nicky Parsons, who seems to have a past with Bourne as well. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is on your face following almost everything. The pursuit of the car is even more intense if it seems possible that the first two. And the veteran cast that chases Bourne is excellent with a good deal of Albert Finney. It also has slight political connotations in relation to surrender and other government policies, but that is minor and very well integrated into the plot. In summary, this is the best of the conclusions of this year's trilogy, if not the best trilogy of action in history.
