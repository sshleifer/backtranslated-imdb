Rohmer deviates from his usual portraits of the French middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocratic lady during the French Revolution. The most attractive of "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetic that Rohmer has achieved. The images have been digitally decorated so that they look like baroque images. In some moments, you can not really tell if you are watching a movie or a series of images in the Louvre Musseum. Each shot is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> --- ----------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
