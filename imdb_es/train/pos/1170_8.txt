Night Of The Living Homeless is a fun parody of the 1978 movie (and the new 2004 release) of "Dawn Of The Dead." Only this time ... with the homeless. The episode has homeless people coming to South Park and people can not understand why. They treat homeless people like zombies who want a change and some of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie. So now it's the children's turn to find out where they come from and how to get rid of them. This is a pretty fun episode with some good moments like the guys singing their own version of the song 2pac / Dr.Dre "California Love". In general, a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
