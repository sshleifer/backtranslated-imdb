An excellent film that shows the crossed currents in the lives of a multiethnic mix of people not so common in the rural Pacific Northwest. Sound direction and writing along with good acting, especially the performances of Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the successful "Crash", written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the action may not be as frantic as in the urban area of ​​Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to know each other better in "Apart from that," but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and problematic as His stories are as resonant as any of the "Crash" stories. For those viewers who appreciated "Crash" this is a must-see movie. In addition, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will like this movie.
