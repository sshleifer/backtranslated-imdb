The often misunderstood Zabriskie Point is the political film of Antonioni, the American film of Antonioni. Stylistically, he follows his example after "Blow-Up", which means that the rhythm is faster than in the previous epics, although it is certainly no less idiosyncratic. <br /> <br /> Basically, the common mistake is that the movie glorifies the hippie generation. It is not like this. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists come from very different backgrounds. Brand of young "rebels", Daria of a real estate agency. But in the style of Antonioni, both are alienated, both trying to escape from their surroundings. Mark leaves a meeting of rebellious students and Black Panthers disappointed with verbose and empty rhetoric, while Daria remains restless with his car. <br /> <br /> Antionioni, the master director, after portraying the young rebel as confused and shallow, then moves to the city. An environment saturated with corporatism, advertisements, lack of meaning, which must continue to expand to adapt to the similar expansion of the population, generating profits at the same time. This is the environment from which the two protagonists escape, although it seems that it is not accidental. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Daria stops in a small town on the outskirts of the desert, the atmosphere is just as stifling. and the people as well as the lost cases, better exemplified by an old boxing champion, now reduced to a shadow of himself, sitting drinking and smoking and talking nonsense. An impressive melancholic sequence, which became even more powerful with the inclusion of some half-wild children living around, brought by some "benefactor" but "destroying a genuine piece of American history". In a not so dark symbolism, there is an opinion of Antonioni about the hippies. Just a half-positive look at the canvas of human alienation. <br /> <br /> And then there is the desert, the landscape used for a devastating effect, at once pure and terrifying, primitive, wild and dead. The sequence where the two protagonists make love, "united" in fantasy by the generation "flower" reflects the similar sequence in "Red Desert", where Giuliana tells a story to her son. It is a colorful intermediate in a colorless landscape. A vivid fantasy half in a suffocating reality. <br /> <br /> The ending probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in the cinema, the western civilization in pieces. A catharsis, an exorcism. <br /> <br /> The two "international" films of Antionioni (the British "Blow-Up" and the American "Zabriskie Point") are less efforts than the previous masterpieces, but that is largely due to the faster pace and the inevitably devised adjustments (the London movement, the power of flowers in America). But when it comes to that, it's clear that he has not lost the advantage.
