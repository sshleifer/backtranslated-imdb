This is one of the best movies I've seen in years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but she's excellent like Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is excellent as Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister, Sophie, is hysterical as Miss Bates. And check out the magnificent Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; What a gentleman! Whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to be good has never seen Emma. I think that's what separates him from so many others: he has class. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family, or look for a romance for you, look no further. Emma is that movie. With a beautiful stage, wonderful costumes and an outstanding cast (did I mention the beautiful Jeremy Northam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
