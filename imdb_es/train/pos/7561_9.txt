The version I saw of this movie was the Blockbuster rental with a similar title, but with a word of fervor. <br /> <br /> This movie was very funny. He was also faithful to the bone. If you ever spent time in Hollywood or in the surrounding area, you will understand humor. If not, you can not 'understand' it at all. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in the business who struggle to achieve it until they finally reach a breaking point is a rare gem. He says it's a drama, but it's as much a drama as Deer Hunter is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is wonderful, as always, as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy was able to maintain his own good. His performance is especially impressive during the poodle scene. The only drawback was Carmen Electra, but we can not have everything.
