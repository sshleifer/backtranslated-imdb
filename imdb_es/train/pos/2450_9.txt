I have been watching this program since I was 14 years old and I have loved it ever since. I love this show because it's just funny! You will enjoy this program a lot because it shows something new and more fun every day and my favorite part is when Benny always has his last comments about George after every blow on his giant and fat head. * Laughs * I would laugh and I would see it with my friends at home it would be as if we were watching a funny but short film. I love George Lopez. Fun, talented, fun, spectacular. This is a fun and funny comedy series for everyone, and you will definitely enjoy it, I did it! And if you have not seen it yet, I suggest you start looking because you will not want to stop seeing it. Although there are no new episodes, I still enjoy the repetitions. It's still funny. It never goes away. <br /> <br /> 9/10
