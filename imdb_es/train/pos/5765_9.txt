['Zombie Bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fanatics for zombie fans with a true love for the genre Horror. As I understand from the commentary and the things that I have read, it was done during the great flood of the Midwest of 1993, when half of Missouri was underwater. The buildings were under water. Cars and houses were under water. An article said that the zombies and the equipment of this movie would help to bag the river after shooting each day. The fact that this movie has been made is a miracle. It&#39;s like a huge mix of all the zombie movies that have been made through a Troma filter. It&#39;s a party movie to enjoy with friends who like lots of splashed and silly characters. And it is fast-paced and energetic and very fun. <br /><br /> A toxic spill accident at a nuclear power facility causes people to melt or turn into zombies. The local government covers it, demolishes the factory and builds houses on it. Some land changes (?) Cause a cave to open and some new residents find the cave and untie the undead in the newly built community. From there it just goes crazy and bloody and fun. <br /><br /> I have read these reviews here a few times. And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this funny little movie three times as a different critic, using fake names. They use the same words and sentences. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It is raw. It has some bad performance. The same goes for half of the films made. There is much more WORSE than this funny movie. If you hate this movie so much, do not buy it. There is no need for personal attacks and call the crew or launch &quot;Trailer Trash&quot;. And it is obvious that you are not from Australia or England. It is simply annoying that this great service, the IMDb does not catch the people who use it only to destroy others. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not care. I give both good and bad reviews. But it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie. Sad. <br /><br /> Some of these so-called &quot;reviewers&quot; even basically demand their &quot;revision&quot; only to promote their own films. One call this movie Bored - well, you love her or hate her, one thing you can never say about this movie is that it&#39;s boring. It moves fast and never has a boring point. <br /><br /> Oh, and this critic from the Netherlands? Um - LIAR. You tried to publish this same review on Amazon and it was shot there. The SAME review only said it was from Missouri. <br /><br /> This nonsense has to stop. I love it or you hate it, give it a real review or do not write anything. It is obvious that you have not seen the movies. <br /><br /> But for the record, I have and although this is not the best I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s far from being the worst. And even the worst would be to give a real REVIEW and not attack the director personally. <br /><br /> I hope this review helps some people see the stupidity that happens here.']
