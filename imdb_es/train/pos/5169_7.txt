I watched the last five or ten minutes of this movie in 1998 or 1999, one night when I was browsing the channel before going to bed, and I really liked what I saw. Since then I have been watching, searching the TV listings, browsing the DVD / VHS shelves in stores, but I did not find a copy until recently, when I discovered that some Internet stores were selling it. So, being a world-class procrastinator, I still did not order it. Finally, I found a DVD copy in a Circuit City when I visited Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then it only took me a month to go home before I sat down and saw him. <br /> <br /> So, what do I think about the movie? It's good. Not as good as I remembered and expected, but still worth it for the $ 9.99 it cost me. After watching the full movie for the first time, I rate it as a 7/10, with potential to become an 8/10. I will have to have less sleep then, and have a better sound system to avoid going back and capture a bit of dialogue.
