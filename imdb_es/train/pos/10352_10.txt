Religious fanaticism is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. <br /> <br /> A dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having "killed" her own baby. I do not want to ruin the story for you, but you need to know the basics before kneeling in what made this woman inside a prison. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred for those who are different continues to thrive throughout the world. <br /> <br /> This is a very exciting moving image with an excellent cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Australian accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is their native pronunciation, are outstanding. Those with support roles are also quite good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> See!
