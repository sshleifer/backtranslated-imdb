['This is a lovely movie that is so exaggerated that my wife, daughter and I find it irresistible. The plot is crazy, but &quot;sounds true&quot; to the world of telenovelas in all their extravagant improbabilities and impossibilities. <br /><br /> I particularly enjoyed the performances of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I&#39;m nobody better than Kline playing THICKheaded. The really desperate need for attention and affirmation of Field&#39;s character, and his almost bipolar changes in mood, played very well in the context of Field&#39;s famous (infamous?) &quot;You liked it!&quot; Oscar exclamation People who can be taken with such a large grain of salt are very rare in this world. <br /><br /> I think this is the only movie in which I was not impatient with the characterization of Whoopi Goldberg; I thought I was &quot;right&quot; on every note I played. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also first class. A great movie if you are in the mood to accompany you on the trip and RISE!']
