Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. The story: a businessman is blackmailed by about 3 criminals. Roy Schieder does a great job since the main character and the special credit have to go to John Glover, who plays a kind of naughty psychopath. I must mention that the characters of the villains are very complex and interesting, something that is very rare in an action movie. It also has some beautiful and attractive women; the most notable are Kelly Preston as the young bat of Schieder's character. Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the whore who is connected with the three blackmailers. I'm glad to say that Ann-Margaret has not lost it yet, this lady is a real babe. Do not watch the rhythm of this movie. I really do not know what the public and some critics have against this movie, but my suggestion is to ignore them and see this truly exciting and undervalued movie. You will enjoy it, that is a promise. Recommended A +.
