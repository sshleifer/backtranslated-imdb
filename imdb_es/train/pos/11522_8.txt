I've wanted to see this for a long time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this movie I thought it was a great follow-up after that, however, it starts crawling. The acting and the direction were phenomenal. In fact, everything in the movie seemed to flow, except the script. Sometimes, the only thing that kept my attention was the fact that in the cast she was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This movie was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look for the great cameos by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
