Introducing Lily Mars is a really nice little movie that shows the comedy skills of actress Judy Garland, along with her standard singing moments. The plot is that Lily Mars accompanies them after producer John Thornway for his great opportunity. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this movie for everyone. Judy is awesome in this role!
