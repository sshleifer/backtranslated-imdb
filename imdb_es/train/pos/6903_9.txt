This little appreciated movie is one of my favorites. I can see it again and again. Dreyfus and Braga are masters, but Raul Julia steals the show! A GÃ³mez Addams ironic, threateningly humorous, with the right tone for this irreverent parody of this story told often. <br /> <br /> Generally unclothed or prized, Moon Over Parador allows you to review Make and join the fun that looms on the screen. Two thumbs up!
