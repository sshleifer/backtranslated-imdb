It is funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but man, this is funny. Kline and Fields are great. (Her takeoff line "God, you're so bewildered" when she climbs to her window - great! Kline is running out the door after examining Teri Hatcher - also great!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work together without problems - until he discovers who she really is ... a soap opera turn if there was one! <br /> <br /> The scene near the end in the Chinese dining room had my children and I rolling on the floor - that scene alone is worth the price of the rent. <br /> <br /> It does not solve any problem in the world or show the weak aspect of daytime television (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
