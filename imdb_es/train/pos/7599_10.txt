Before Losing everything that was shown on television was predictable. You could predict who would die or who would find something, but in Lost you could not predict ANYTHING. Everything was surprisingly surprising and it really was a mystery not because I had so many secrets but because there was nothing like it before everything was so good. I literally became addicted to that. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something to look forward to every week. He is a genius. The environment is bright, it's calm and warm on the beach and it's so scary in the jungle. The characters are a work of genius, each of them especially those who are already on the island. The castaways are so dramatic, however, we can never predict their death because they have much more to do and much more to say, and they have secrets that affect the other shipwrecked people who die with them.
