['This is a little long (2 hours, 20 minutes) but I had a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel. In other words, a lot of ground to cover. <br /><br /> Sometimes it was a soap opera, but it also had some visually dramatic moments, topped by a locust attack at the end of the movie. It was amazing to see it. Considering that this movie is approximately 70 years old, the special effects team of this film did a spectacular job. <br /><br /> Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their time and they do not disappoint here, as they both provide powerful performances. The only problem is the credibility, since all the Asians are played by the Caucasians and some of them, like Walter Connolly, simply do not seem real. I would like to see a new version of this film with actors from all over Asia, not for PC reasons, but simply to make the story look and sound more believable.']
