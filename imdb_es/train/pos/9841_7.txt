I love cartoons. They can show things that movies with actors and "real" scenarios can not, although the effects of the computer are changing more and more. They can push the limits of satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), the show ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in the "Ice Age," such as when we see a motley herd of now extinct mammals migrating across the field, chatting like old friends. It's a pleasure to watch those scenes, as it gives us the feeling of familiarity and strangeness at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the best animated movies of all time, it's a very funny movie. Sit down, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the precious backgrounds and the laughter. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred, the grumpy mammoth, Sid, a lazy idiot, and Diego, a saber-toothed tiger, as they take a human Baby back to their tribe - for very different reasons. On the road, naturally, they have many problems. Along the journey, Popat also appears, the most unfortunate rodent in history, desperately trying to bury an acorn for winter: in glaciers, on top of dead trees, in ice caves. His initial scene is a classic. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story with a very predictable ending and a medium that is just a series of funny incidents with some moments of character creation, but some of the scenes, like the diaper that changes or the dodos They are fun, the animals are nice and they look good. There is also a very touching moment, when the mammoth rock paintings come to life in front of Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> It's not a must, but it's good for an hour of fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
