['I have read the book and I must say that this film remains true to its form. I think this is the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same Psycho genre. Cristina Raines offers an excellent performance as a protagonist, and Burgess Meredith offers an excellent supporting actor as a neighbor next door. I&#39;ve seen this movie at least twice and I think I&#39;m going to buy both the book and the film for my collection. The suspense continues to increase until the climactic end, the turn you will never see coming. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, The Sentinel will be a classic prelude. In addition, what is interesting are the actors in the film: you would not recognize them if you did not read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is excellent as a commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as a photographer. There is also Beverly D&#39;Angelo, who is underestimated but excellent.']
