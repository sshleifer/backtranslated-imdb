One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Although judging by the size of it, the house would today be a dream mansion. Still Cary was making a good living in the advertising field, even though he was having a hard time trying to create a slogan for ham with the Wham brand. <br /> <br /> What made this movie so popular was the shortage of housing in the years after World War II. Veterans returning from the war claimed their rights under the GI Bill of Rights, which included mortgage loans. The problem was that, literally, there were not enough houses to meet the demand. Around the time when Eric Hodgins' book and movie were so popular, Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Act that put the government first in the housing construction business . <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and aunt who were building their own house where they moved in the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters and wanted to get out of downtown Rochester. Their place was not as big as a house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, they still lived there the rest of their lives the way Cary and Myrna probably did. <br /> <br /> Of course it was expensive and the costs continue to rise and threaten to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas nearby to offer advice, usually too late. To tell the truth, he is kind enough to Myrna and Cary knows it. <br /> <br /> The role of Myrna Loy is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you imagine that Charles moved to the country and William Powell had the headaches that Cary Grant has, the film will still work well. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as a comedy because situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and my aunt Kate, who lived together in the house of their dreams for more than 40 years.
