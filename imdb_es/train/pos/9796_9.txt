In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the successful program to produce a feature film, originally scheduled for Direct-to-Video, but with great theatrical success. state. It would be known as Batman: Ghost Mask. Ten years after Phantasm, we have released three additional movies from the WB guys, Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now, Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family. <br /> <br /> The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: a new vigilante who models herself after Batman has begun to attack the operations led by the mafia boss of Gotham, Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot, also known as The Penguin. Now, Batman must try to unravel the Batwoman mystery before it crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The animation is the most elegant and futuristic style that was used for Batman: the fifth and sixth season of the animated series (AKA) The new adventures of Batman). , is very well done, and as elegant as the animation of the Return of the Joker. There is also some use of CGI, but it is smaller compared to the overabundance in Sub-Zero. The music was good. Different and exotic and similar to the score of the Justice League, although the points in the score when the old Batman animated theme arises will surely send waves of nostalgia through the hearts in the form of rodents of older fans. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, does a wonderful job like Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also great to have Batman's old student back: The Animated Series; that includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl, her cameo intimates the romantic relationship between her and Bruce that is mentioned in Batman Beyond), and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (Alfred ). <br /> <br /> The villains were also great, especially since Rupert Thorne, the former mafia boss of the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> In general While it recently did not reach the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm, MOTB carries the torch pretty well for animated Batman movies. And if you have the DVD and you're a fan, you'll love the short five-minute Chase Me.
