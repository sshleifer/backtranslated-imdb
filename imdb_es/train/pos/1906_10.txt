Unfortunately, 8 Simple Rules, to go out with my teenage daughter, was the last comedy in which John Ritter started working after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors of all time. He had it all, comedy (he can forget about it at Three's Company) but he was also an excellent dramatic actor (can not you watch the television movie?). So much I loved the other cast members of the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was THE star, it was the main reason why I was attracted to the show in the first place, and it was his perfect comedy delivery that he could make me crack again and again. <br /> <br /> I loved that the program was not sweet, sweet (as much as I liked The Cosby Show, come on, they were too kind between them, hahaha) they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly. It was quite realistic what with all the sibling rivalry and disputes between parents, but it still kept him amused. A lot of American comedies try to fill the programs completely with morals and what is not, and this program did not do that. Yes, there were some, such as addressing important issues, such as drugs and bullying, but they did not try to be a fun family comedy. <br /> <br /> The way they wrote John's death in The show was done brilliantly, I still sob like a baby every time I see him. You could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly difficult episodes. <br /> <br /> I'm sad that the program was canceled, I still enjoy watching the reruns and I never get tired of it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will always be remembered for your graceful representation of this overprotective father, who would prefer to lock his daughters in his room rather than going out with a child =) ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Ritter !!!
