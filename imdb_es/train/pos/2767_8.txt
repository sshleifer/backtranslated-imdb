Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this movie. The last 15 minutes (or more) are great and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. However, the same can not be said about the rest of the film. It's not horrible and I'm sure it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (to be honest) is to see Peck. For the rest, it is better to read the Old Testament.
