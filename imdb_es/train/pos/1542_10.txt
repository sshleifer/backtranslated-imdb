well done, giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war. excellent performance, especially when the German high command refuses in the name of cavalry to present the medal that Kaiser ordered to hit. the scenes of the butcher shop are probably too intense for the ephemeral minds of EE. UU who would probably prefer some silly speeches and meaningless abstractions like 14 points or the league of nations. Americans could really appreciate the plot and the action. for all the action and intrigue, fraulein doktor compares favo (u) maliciously with Jacob's Ladder.
