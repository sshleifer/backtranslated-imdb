For me, movies and acting have to do with telling a story. The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy that is profound and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical story. In this film I thought that the narration of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward were at their best. Knowing and understanding David's story and his journey to become the King of Israel made this story even more convincing. You could feel his lust for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the true human side of this man who in his time was bigger than life. Fear, the reluctance of Susan Hayward, but then obedience to her authority as her King was beautifully portrayed by her. One could also feel David's anguish when Uriah spent the night at the door instead of at home. As well as the sadness when he was killed in battle. The powerful and authoritative condemnation of Raymond Massey to the King made me feel his anger. The sets were real enough, and the atmosphere credible. In general, I think this was one of the best movies of its kind. I gave him a rating of ten.
