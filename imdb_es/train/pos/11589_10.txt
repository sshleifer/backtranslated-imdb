Man, I loved this movie! This really takes me back to when I was a child. These were the days when the teachers still showed movies in the classroom in real and if they were good, they would rewind the movie slowly so that I could see it in retreat. I still remember one of the first lines ... "Tutazema was his name, and he was an orphan, he lived with his sister in the village." This is a great movie for children and as durable as the red balloon. In the end, the other Indian children of the town put the feathers to Tutazema and he himself becomes an eagle. He comes to live as he always wanted. He gets to raise the heavens.
