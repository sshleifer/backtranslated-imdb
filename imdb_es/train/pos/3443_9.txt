A convincing, honest, daring and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches the painful experiences of pain caused by rape. "Descent" is a film that was not detected due to its lack of distribution because, frankly, the film is so brutal in its performances, that if it had been released theatrically, it could have met with a strong hatred skewed. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be discovered, not only for its dark themes, and not only for its incredible direction and authentic style, but above all for its performances. Chad Faust is absolutely amazing, as it brings enough sickness and enough vulnerability to make one unrelated, but he understands this fractured man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality, not only with the women he rapes, but also with the fragile insecurities deep within himself. . It's a supportive performance that is so complex, courageous and emotional on Faust's part. And hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, the highlight is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. A journey through the force of realistic dramatic tics, and one of the most subtle and yet, as strong as it can be in a long time. While Dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some movies from big to bad, she shows that she has what it takes to offer some emotional and moving performances, credibly and thematically. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of his year (and 2007 was a strong year): this underestimated and intelligent film had a great theatrical success, it would shout praises for her, like Dawson and Faust. Too bad it was too strong for a widespread appeal. Movies like this deserve better!
