The house that drips blood is the third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series, this would make eight movies. Although, that movie is very different from the others. <br /> <br /> I look at Amicus anthologies with great memories like I used to love them when I was a teenager. My feelings for them today are just as strong. <br /> <br /> I spent many years trying to locate this movie. The synopses of the stories were so attractive that I came to pay a substantial amount when I finally found a copy. Although the movie is very good, I felt a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it. It was not as good as I was led to believe. Although it is better than its two predecessors, it is not as good as its four successors, as I will show. <br /> <br /> The link story sees John Bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in an old mysterious house. Your trip starts at the local police station where you learn the stories of the previous occupants. The link story later sees him visit the real estate agent who sold the house. While this bonding story seems attractive on paper, it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of all Amicus anthologies. I could not help feeling that John Bennett is a poor version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I would rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role. We might even have had both here, one as a police inspector and another as a real estate agent. They could, and I think they would, have given life to this weak element of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film contains four stories, each of which focuses on one inhabitant of the house. <br /> <br /> The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories. He is absorbed in an exciting story about a strangler, even drawing a sketch to help him write. Soon after, he begins to see visions of his own creation. An excellent address by Peter Duffell, particularly with the choice of camera angles, helps to detract from the restricted script. Elliott's performance is excellent as the writer tormented and also helps to raise the story. The story ends with a semi-turn, but I could not help having the feeling of a script that did not allow him to reach his potential. <br /> <br /> The second story sees Peter Cushing enter the house. He is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once fired him and who keeps a photo. Cushing's performance really brings this emotionally moving story to life. He is helped by the director who chooses to include a continuous focus on the solitude of Cushing. This goes further with a great hallucination scene that helps us see into Cushing's mind. Anyway, Cushing sees a figure in a nearby wax museum that looks like his girl. Naturally, his obsession grows, but this apparently romantic story has a disturbing turn at the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival, but his great performance is overshadowed by the late great Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story and, easily, the best one, go to Christopher Lee, my favorite terror actor of all time, move into the house with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives one his perfect ice performances here. He does not show love or attention for his daughter at all. He even brings a school governess to educate her. The governess, played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another of her magnificent performances, tries to find out what is wrong. Without revealing too much, I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role. The presence of Christopher Lee is truly electrifying in every scene in which he finds himself. Chloe Franks deserves a special recognition for her interpretation as underestimated as the girl who is easily the most spooky character in the entire movie. It is worth watching the movie, even to see only this story. <br /> <br /> The final story is played almost exclusively for laughter, but it is certainly entertaining and that is what matters. Jon Pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house. He is very dissatisfied with the approach that his producers give to the cinema, since he considers that everything is cheap and false, in particular the costumes. So he decides to buy an authentic cape for his latest vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent cameo as a merchant who sells an antique cape to Pertwee. When Pertwee puts on the cloak, he begins to develop fangs and basically transforms into a vampire. Pertwee's performance must be seen to be believed. It really is hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story, but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much bigger. <br /> <br /> The bonding story ends with a loose connection to the final story. This is particularly appropriate since the inspector was looking for Pertwee and, of course, decides to visit the house. The rest you can exercise for yourself. As weak as the history that links it, it has a decent ending, although somewhat involuntarily comical. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that the fault of the deficiencies in what should have been a really magnificent film does not lie with Peter Duffell, the director, who really does everything possible with what he has. I think the script was too sober and lacked the ambition that can be found in the four subsequent films. <br /> <br /> In general, THE HOUSE THAT BLOWN THE BLOOD, despite its shortcomings, is a must see for fans of the Amicus Anthologies, fans of other Amicus movies or fans of horror movies of Portmanteau. If my summary gives the movie enough appeal in their eyes, take a look. You will enjoy it!
