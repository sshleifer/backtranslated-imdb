Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous vaudeville comedy, Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken in more than 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and since then he has held a grudge. Such is the premise of this funny play by Neil Simon made film. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns at their best, and the material is more fun than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as Matthau's nephew and agent. There are even old clips of real stars from the golden age for you to get into the rhythm of the film, and the character actor Fritz Feld starts all with a "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, who started in the 1930s in the theater with Orson Welles and later became a grandmother in "Family Matters", is great in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with him (and maybe I was too demanding and / or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they meet for the first time. Granted, he has had many resentful resentments in all these years, but some of the things he does would be considered gross or simply bad manners taken out of context. Also, I'm used to seeing Matthau act that way in other movies, but not George Burns. And, Matthau's bellow tends to age a little. <br /> <br /> In short, if you need a movie that is always fun to help you and forget your problems, put "The Sunshine Boys". They will lift your spirit and make you think of a simpler time and way of life. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to slide". <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think you have to slide it."
