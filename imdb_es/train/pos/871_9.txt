['Sur mes l√®vres or READ MY LIPS is a small and exciting thriller that also examines the lives of &quot;outsiders&quot;, people who live on the periphery of our vision and who struggle with the need to &quot;fit in&quot;. The director Jacques Audiard and the co-writer Tonino Benacquista have created a small tense, tight and completely entertaining thriller that makes some important statements about unusual individuals and their difficulties. <br /><br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a simple secretary of Jane, mostly deaf, something unknown to a company whose life is social and sexual isolation and whose vision of the future is quite grim. Enter Paul (Vincent Cassel), a recently released former parolee who responds to an ad to be Carla&#39;s assistant. There is a mutual physical revulsion at the first meeting: Carla had waited for a well-groomed and gentle man who could fulfill her fantasies and Paul is a rude and careless man who is not impressed to be an employee. His concepts change pretty quickly when Paul rescues Carla&#39;s work by completing his request to steal a letter that would cost him his job and Paul discovers Carla&#39;s lip reading skills, which he sees as a way to spy on criminals from his past that threaten his life. Money due. So this strange couple of a team joins forces and together they enter into a dangerous and full strategy of suspense to obtain the security and freedom of Paul. The relationship is full of twists and the edge of seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters who fulfill roles in their lives that fill the cracks in their isolation walls in a surprising way. <br /><br /> Devos and Cassel offer acts of bravery and the rest of the cast is uniformly strong. Once again, Alexandre Desplat has produced a musical score that increases tension and cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied finds the right angles and angles to suggest the isolation worlds of the characters, as well as the sense of Hitchcock&#39;s suspense. The director Audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is both sensitive and transformative for the story: it shows us the difference between &quot;listening&quot; to the world with and without headphones and doing so makes some powerful social commentaries. This is a good movie that stays in the range of the best French film genre. Recommended. Harp grady']
