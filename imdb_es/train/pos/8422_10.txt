An extra is requested to play a general in a film about the Russian Revolution. However, it is not an ordinary extra. He is Serguis Alexander, former commander-in-chief of the armies of Russia who is now forced to relive the same scene, in which he suffered a professional and personal tragedy, to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionary in Russia and was humiliated by Alexander. Now may be the time for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate battle. This is a powerful film with a meticulous Von Sternberg direction, which provides the greatest irony in the character of Alexander in everything he can. Jannings deserved his Oscar for the role with a very touching performance playing the general in its heyday and in his deepest valley. Powell lends sinister support as a revenge-minded director and Brent is perfect in her role, with her face and movements that show as much expression as Jannings's love. All around the brilliance. Score, 10
