['Thanks to God ABC picked this up instead of Fox. The best description (for those who know) is that Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best possible way. <br /><br /> I&#39;m not sure if an experience with death and destiny at a young age makes me a fan of Brian Fuller, but I certainly enjoy his productions. I also enjoy checkered floors, cakes, talking toys, gravel and other naughty items :) Although a little &quot;Burtonesque&quot;, I certainly believe that you enjoy your own niche that does not require J Depp or HB Carter to be a beautiful playground. imaginative. Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood colliding with each of them and, in fact, make sense and make us want to live life to the fullest!']
