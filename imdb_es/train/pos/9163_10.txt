When my daughter, now of college age, was in preschool, this miniseries appeared in A & E from 8 to 9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we would not miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our children were late for preschool every morning throughout the week. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten how much I loved this movie until I took out my old copy on VHS recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but he is still perfect like Rochester. The dark and steep face, the imperious attitude tempered with humor and tenderness were directly from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats some stage, I could not sit through an adaptation starring William Hurt or the cranky Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get entangled in romance. <br /> <br /> I'd love to know what happened to Zelah Clarke. She is dead like Jane, quiet, formal, telling volumes with just a glance. The brightness in their eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and energetic nature that helped Jane survive the abuse she endured in youth. The criticism of his performance as "wooden" is out of place. A maid in a proper English house would have maintained a similar attitude, but she speaks passionately when she feels overwhelmed by emotion. Unlike many other screens of Janes, she seems clear enough to be Jane, but nice enough to allow the audience to buy the attraction that Rochester feels for her. <br /> <br /> Bronte's dialogue is a big part of why the book lasts a long time. of her intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interaction between Jane and Rochester with wit and silent intensity. Although Jane seems as simple and sweet as vanilla cream, she refuses to be intimidated by the dark and windy Rochester. The two drivers play each other beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romantic novel.
