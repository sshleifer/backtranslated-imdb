I saw it as part of my course at the University of Aberystwyth and it baffles me that this does not have a distributor in the UK. Well, it's not really like that, because this movie is all that a Hollywood movie is not: original, creative, quirky and fun. It seems that nowadays nobody wants to see this type of film since, in the simplest terms, it does not conform to the generic conventions that most young viewers look for in a film. <br /> <br /> I do not have I did not write a review for the IMDb for years, but I felt inclined to give this movie a special mention, even if it's during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is nothing, since the two main characters are immersed in their own world of nothing through the hatred of the world. The brilliance here is how the director keeps the interest during most of the execution time with only two characters and when the only staging consists of half house and a vast white and empty space. This is due in large part to the star performances of the actors, who offer a lot of laughter and at the same time can add a great emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I'd love to write a little more, but I'm in a pretty long time limit. However, I encourage everyone to try this movie. A very unique concept is presented on the screen in a coherent and well executed way, with the combination of good performances, a solid script, a nice sound design and (quite) impressive visuals that create a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that few people know anything ...
