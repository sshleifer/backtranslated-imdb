This is not the kind of movie that John Wayne is known for. Play a diplomat, a man who does things through words and persuasion instead of physical action. The film moves with a calm realism through its superficially little exciting story. <br /> <br /> For the open mind, the patient and the reflective, this film is a rich description of an intriguing part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are two stories intertwined. The great story is of an internalized, isolationist Japan and an externalized and expansionist America that collides when its interests come into conflict. The little story, human, is of a foreign barbarian (Wayne) and of the initial hostility of Geisha and a civilized Geisha that deviates towards mutual respect and love. Human history is a reflection of the greatest history of the two nations. <br /> <br /> The film is very well made and all the actors play their roles well. The two main roles are performed perfectly. John Wayne is excellent as Townsend Harris, who achieves exactly the right combination of strength and negotiation in his relations with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is equally excellent as the title Geisha, charming and charming. The interaction between his character and John Wayne's is particularly well represented. This is exactly how these two individuals would have behaved (as shown in the film). <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. It lacks all pomposity. and it is a realistic representation of the manner in which the described events may have occurred. The characters are real people, not "big" figures in history who are timidly aware. In addition, the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. In fact, the clash of a traditionalist, traditionally powerful, isolationist Japan and an emerging and powerful new nation across the ocean can be summed up very well in an exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that the shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in Japan, and that the passing ships can not even embark in the harbor in search of water. The baron replies that Japan only wants to be left alone. The character of Wayne responds that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international navigation, and that if things continue as before, the nation will be considered as nothing more than a band of bandits that infest an important highway. A very real summary of the way in which the two countries saw themselves as if they were right, and saw the other as wrong. The resulting conflict between two peoples with their own justice and with interests in conflict has its reflections throughout history, a continuous theme that echoes in the present and in the future. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and the representation of mid-nineteenth century in Japan, before the accelerated growth towards industrialization that was to follow later in the century, is excellent. A visual pleasure and an enlightening vision of the ancient civilization of Japan. <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone, be it a John Wayne fan or not, to see this movie if he has the opportunity. Just keep in mind that it is not an action movie. It is a representation of an interesting place and time in history, and a slowly boiling love story that (to his surprise) comes to dominate the personal life of the two main characters. Watch this movie for its merits, without preconceived ideas, allow yourself to immerse yourself in its history and enjoy it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> In short, an excellent movie.
