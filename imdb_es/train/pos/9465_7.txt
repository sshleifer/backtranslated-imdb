Steve Carell once again stars in a romantic movie about choices, family and pressure. Judging by the plot and the cover of the film, I expected a flat comedy, lots of laughter and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Of course the movie had some comedy, but for me, Steve Carell, once again, gave a great show. The film itself really addresses the real observations and that was a strong element that I found. But, the end felt a bit rushed and predictable. In general, the cinematography was excellent, the performance was excellent and the message it conveyed was obvious, but still very important. However, it was reduced to an old, flat and predictable ending. I suppose that if different choices were made at the end of the movie (maybe for the bad guys, even) this movie would get better publicity. It's still a funny movie.
