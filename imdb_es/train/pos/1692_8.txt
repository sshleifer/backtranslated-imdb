Like the great classic cartoons of Bugs Bunny, this movie has humor in different levels. I just presented this to my 10-year-old daughter and my 11-year-old son. They both enjoyed the movie, laughing a few times ... and my daughter is not a fan of science fiction. The movie made me laugh despite having seen a couple of times ... the adult-level humor (that is, the humor that adults will get simply because of better life experiences, you can not find any bad things here). quality or with R rating) keeps the film equally pleasant for adults. For example, adult-level humor, Martian voices are based on characters from different movies / actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and manners of Jack Nicholson; The scientist, Dr. Strangelove of Peter Seller's. The special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The lack of the top 10 actors actually favors the film, and actors / actresses play an important role. In fact, I would say that the producers selected the actors and their abilities for the needs of the roles on the power of box office draw (an excellent example is the character of "Vern" by Wayne Alexander). I had to write this review ... the children are playing this for the third time in 4 days during dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a weekend late at night, there's nothing in the movie and I get bored.
