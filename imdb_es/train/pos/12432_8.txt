I expected this to be the same kind of stupidity as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, so I left it without looking for a long time, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from being a succession of silly battles of guns and car / boat chases, it was an almost reflective analysis of how a beautiful girl becomes as hard as her nails, without anything being exaggerated or over streamlined <br /> <br /> It's likely that the budget restrictions actually helped with that: less time and effort was invested in finding increasingly stupid ways to make dummy doubles, and to devote more time to making it worthwhile. It's worth watching the movie. Hell, the biggest gun battle takes place off the screen, and the scene where you listen is so much better for that background noise, which adds to the suspense, who's winning? Who is dying? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as beautiful as Monica Vitti, but few are, and she certainly has all the class and fire it takes to make the character work, and the way his face, his hair and his tall, thin body could have risen directly from the comic strip graphics. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise bad-guy, in which he made the character interesting and pleasant to watch, even pleasant (and I doubt he would consider dealing with many brutal killers and psychopaths as friends drinkers). I can not think of one of the "former waiters" in Hollywood who could have played that role well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Blaise's bad guys always die, in the end (there are no spoilers there!) That's a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time fainting over such a handsome and interesting ass they can now settle pragmatically with us as common Joes.
