['Oliver! The musical is one of my favorites. The music, the characters, the story. Everything just seems perfect. In this version of the timeless classic novel turned into a musical stage, the director Carol Reed gives life to the success of Broadway on the screen of the film. <br /><br /> The transition from musical to musical film is not easy. You must have the correct voices, the correct set, the correct script and the correct reproduction. All the signs point to each other for this play. It almost seems like it was written for the screen! <br /><br /> Our story takes place in cheerful England, where a child named Oliver manages to leave the orphanage. It crosses the country and goes to London, where it is with a group of delinquents juveniles, headed by Dodger. The leader of this gang is called Fagin, an older man who sells all the stolen goods. <br /><br /> But not all is well in the city of London when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his beloved girlfriend Nancy get tangled up with Oliver, Fagin and his young troops, and the law. What follows is a wonderful story of love, affection and great musical numbers. <br /><br /> If you like musicals or not, you listen to these melodies and hum them all day. Oliver! It is a triumph inside and outside the stage and it is a timeless work of art.']
