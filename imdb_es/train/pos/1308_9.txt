I must say that I really had no idea that I was going to sit down and watch this movie. I guess it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between classes. But, for once, a television movie caught my attention. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my attention. I really was not a big fan of her before this movie. Of course I liked Twister and as good as he gets. But, some of this movie really did it for me. Now I would see myself as a big fan. This movie comes with high ratings of ... me. Give it a try, it will not disappoint you.
