Leonard Maltin must have been watching some other movie. (Although I think your Guide is a very valuable resource, ignore your comments on this). He says "it starts well and then blinks" when in fact it is the opposite: "it starts warm and then burns". The plot is almost as simple as possible. Happy mom, happy dad and happy son take vacations on a secluded beach, dad disabled in an accident, mom rushes out for help, runs into a dangerous runaway convict. Mom tries to trick the convicts into helping while Dad waits and waits for his life. <br /> <br /> The good white nudist Ralph Meeker shocked him, appearing suddenly (the director, John Sturges, filming him in a clever way that will make you gasp) in half like the cunning criminal and desperate. Meeker is an unusually flippant, reckless actor (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly") and he happily snatches the keys to the film's narrative and rushes with the top down. Your character has the habit of smiling childishly and saying "Pretty neat, huh?" when he is especially satisfied with his misdeeds. There is a funny pause in the action when a wheel is punctured and he smoothly instructs his hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Do not leave." She answers "Where would I go?" (They are in the middle of nowhere) and he realizes that the comedy is "Yes, that's right". The friction between them is a scream. <br /> <br /> There are flaws, something ridiculous. There is a scene in which the police, who have been chasing Meeker for some time, stop Stanwyck's car and to evade detection Meeker rests her head on her shoulder like a supposedly loving husband, and pretends to be asleep while being questioned. A. It is clearly not very masculine in this position and B. I think it is safe to say that any adult who seems to be asleep during a meeting with law enforcement will undoubtedly arouse suspicion. <br /> <br /> It's still a robust thriller that builds to an exciting and uplifting conclusion. <br /> <br />
