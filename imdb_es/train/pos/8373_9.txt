['Note for the previous critic: this film is &quot;adaptation of science fiction of the Iliad&quot;, according to the scriptwriter. So, whether the references are painful or not, there is no apology, it is the basis of the film. They admit that they stole ... although adapted is the PC term. <br /><br /> Great movie but too short. It probably did not go as well as the author, the director or the studio wanted, but very fun. The fact that the study imploded during the realization only contributes to his legacy. <br /><br /> A big budget remake would not be so fun, and probably would not do more justice to the script. But it&#39;s fun to dream about the potential there. Apparently, a DVD release with some extras is available, but I do not think it will be played on NTSC players. I am not an expert and therefore I am still trying to solve this. For now, I live with the VHS incarnation.']
