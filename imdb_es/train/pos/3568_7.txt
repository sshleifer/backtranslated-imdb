This film advances Cinderella's story in the early 1950s and makes good, albeit eccentric, use of the Isle of Man as a background. The Ugly Sisters have become extremely attractive upper-class English girls, and along with Kathleen Turner as the stepmother on whom they dress with several wonderful period costumes. The story is slightly altered from the traditional version: from the beginning it is strangely combined with the plot of "King Lear", and in later stages Cinderella is quite more assertive than usual. It looks splendid and generally works quite well, but sometimes it is exaggerated.
