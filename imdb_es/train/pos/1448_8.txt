Across the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any kind of political ambition should take time to watch this movie. The film is called "City Hall" and with little imagination, its synopsis can be made anywhere in America. As it happens, it opens in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough experience to lead a large metropolitan city with very little effort. His right hand is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally brilliant individual who has ambitions linked to his mentor and who both seem destined for higher positions. Everything points in that direction, until a police shoot-out ignites an investigation led by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who believes that the blame points towards the town hall and the mayor. A six-year-old child and the death of a police officer are blamed on a career criminal whose questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up for political payments and corruption in the city involving union leaders such as Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt judicial officials like judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also involved are party officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works for the New York probation office. But it is the link between the mayor and his deputy that is taken into account by the accidental shootings. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet to become a classic. ****
