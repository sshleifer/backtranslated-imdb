I just read the most recent comments about this movie and would like to respond. You're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group N.W.A. dating back to early 1988, in 1989 the ice cube left the band to go alone and, finally, in 1991, the band split up when Dr.dre left. which led to a lot of meat from the departure of ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. this story was based on that. <br /> <br /> Also, this movie was a laugh for 90 minutes, the way They explained that the Bootie Juice song as a political statement was very funny. Not to mention the tasty "love song" was connecting. and when Vanilla Sherley was kicked in the ass, like the record company executive, it's also very funny and his managers are also shot every time. <br /> <br /> People who did not enjoy this movie probably did not. Get it or they were complete idiots, my opinion.
