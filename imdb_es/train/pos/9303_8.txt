When watching this movie, you should keep in mind that it is not a normal movie. It does not have a real story, only characters, a group of gangster characters that come together in perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just lie down and listen. The film stands out because of that it is difficult to find the correct way to describe it. <br /> <br /> That's why the user comments on this movie is so mixed. <br /> <br /> I for one Love the movie and recommend it to all who love simple phrases and things that differ from the "normal". You really can not put your finger on how wonderful this is, it's just a comical world where gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can watch more than once.
