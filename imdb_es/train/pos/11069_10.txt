"Ah, Ritchie made another gangster movie with Statham," thought the average fan, hoping for another Snatch / Lock Stock; maybe waiting for a couple of temporary changes, but none is too hard for "me and the boys" to swallow after a few beers. <br /> <br /> Oh, pay attention, you do need to watch this movie. No teacups, no extra cocaine from the diet on the counter, no shouts of "keep it going" while you get in the refrigerator, watch the movie! Do not laugh more than you can do with considerable violence (and if that makes your boat float, so be it), but a solid and clear direction, excellent dialogue and excellent performances. <br /> <br /> My favorite - Big Pussy Of The Sopranos, always a reliable hood.
