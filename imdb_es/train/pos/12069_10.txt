Yes, it's flawed, especially if you like Hollywood movies that demand a lot of effects, a purely entertaining fantasy story or plot, and you can not think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films are for the intelligent filmmaker, and Insignificance is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> The characterizations are brilliant, the story is excellent, but, like all Nic Roeg movies, it makes you think at all levels about aspects of reality that I have never seen you before. His films always make you think, and personally, I like that in a movie. <br /> <br /> So do not wait to get away from watching this movie and feel very happy, because you are likely to do it. To be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's excellent.
