For a long time I have not seen such a beautiful animated feature. Having a great respect for Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or any other movie made by them can not be compared to this. The animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are amazing, the background environments are amazing, almost all the objects in each picture are drawn to perfection. Sometimes I felt a tingling in my back, so much that I loved what I had seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic. As romantic as the plot of the animated film can be. The characters are adorable, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, he has pawns, rocks and rules! The other char-s are very good too. The humor is first class. <br /> <br /> In general, it seemed that the creators did not invest much effort in this. I mean, it seemed like it did not make much of a difference to the people at Pixar and Dreamworks who are trying harder and harder to think about something new. And I am very happy that a product from the European animation studio has turned SO cool. They made a magnificent and moving film, a sweet for the eyes and the heart. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is a stupid start and that's why it's 9of10 not 10/10
