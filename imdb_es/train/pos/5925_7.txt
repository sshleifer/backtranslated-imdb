['Due to all the negative reviews of this movie, I almost did not see it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a very pleasant horror movie. The performance was not excellent, apart from the wonderful Alice Krige, but part of the dialogue (&quot;Just consider a lunch&quot;) was quite fun. <br /><br /> In general, an effort above the average of Stephen King - 7/10.']
