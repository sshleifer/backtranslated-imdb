"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films that has been proclaimed a masterpiece for a good reason: in fact, it is one of the best films made in the United States. It is both artistically valid and fully accessible and commercial. It is no wonder that it was a great success when it was initially launched. But be careful, it is also one of the most heartbreaking movies ever made. The characters are memorable, well-developed and, ultimately, tragic. The filmmakers must be applauded for not giving us the end of Hollywood, something that was basically mandatory in the 80s. Still, that's why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American cinema. It is a time when you could make well-made films, innovative and, above all, bleak with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. All this was over when "Star Wars" was released. <br /> <br /> The management of John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental edition. Unlike many other movies that present these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has aged quite well. It is still as powerful as it was when it was initially launched. However, acting is what makes this a masterpiece. The backgrounds of the characters are never fully explained, but the interpretations make them fully developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and understanding (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Also, since I am a fan of old exploitation films, I loved the scenes set on the infamous and sordid 42nd street. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made. (10/10)
