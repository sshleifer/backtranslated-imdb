Jim Carrey's rather fun vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gains the power of God and wreaks havoc. Carrey is back on familiar ground here and seems to be having a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is also charming and affectionate. The story is predictable to the extreme, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is great and makes the movie worthwhile. GRADE B
