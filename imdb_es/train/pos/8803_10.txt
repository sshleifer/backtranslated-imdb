I recently saw this on the Sundance channel. The idea of ​​the film was to bring many filmmakers, illustrious in their own country, to make short films, eleven of them, all in a single film, focused on a single theme: September 11. <br /> <br /> From wacthing this movie I could see why these filmmakers were great in their country because they had all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a film from Iran in which a teacher struggles to teach students about what happened on September 11, which they did not realize until later. <br /> <br /> The second film from France involves a deaf woman who writes a letter to her lover with anger while she does not know what is going on like TV. works. <br /> <br /> The next film from Egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking to a dead soldier about recent events, not only about the terrorists of 9/11, but also about the bombings elsewhere. <br /> <br /> then comes Bolivia, where a girl learns about the events of September 11 and believes that they should march for them. <br /> <br /> The next of a country in Africa in which a group of boys follows a man whom they believe is Bin Ladin. <br /> <br /> The next one comes from Mexico where nothing is shown but the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> The next one in Israel involves a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report, but he is often told about the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other movies that I can 'I do not remember at the moment but they are all powerful. It will bring back your emotions of that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
