In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as an employee in a gift shop; there, she argues with co-worker James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two do not get along at work because each one has fallen in love with an invisible correspondence friend. Seeing Ernst Lubitsch directing these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying. <br /> <br /> Even better is a subplot that involves store owner Frank Morgan (like Hugo Matuschek), who suspects his wife is having an affair. By hiring a private detective, Mr. Morgan confirms that his 22-year-old wife is having sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, realizing with pain, "She just did not want to age with me," and the supporting characters are what make this movie not grow old. <br /> <br /> ********* Buy around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
