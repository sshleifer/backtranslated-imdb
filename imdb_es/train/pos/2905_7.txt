This is a very funny movie, easy to see, that entertains you almost all the time. The work of the Director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical story of fellow police officers as a lethal weapon, but the jokes and comedy are of the Argentine type. The twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by Peretti and has to go with Detective Diaz (played by Luque) in his tasks while he also assists him (Diaz is worried because his wife cheated him). Some of the dialogues are fun all over the world: understandable and ridiculous anywhere. It's very good in general, it would deserve an 8, but I qualified with 7 because it gets a little down at the end. In a personal comment, I must add that it is a "bravo" for Argentine filmmakers, considering how little is coming lately.
