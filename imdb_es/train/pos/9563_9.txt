First of all, I would like to say that Edison Chen is extremely sexy and that Sam Lee looks much better than before XD. This is probably one of the most original films I've seen so far; shows a poverty lifestyle of a Cambodian. The Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) is killing people to survive himself; He has done it throughout his life. The duty of Sam Lee (Wai) is to capture the Cambodian forever. There are tons of violent actions, but it has a good story. The film shows the struggles between these two characters; They both hit each other like angry dogs. GO AND SEE THE PPL ... ONLY SUGGESTED! (GO HK FILMS)
