This is a direct movie to the video, so it goes without saying that it will not compete with the first Lion King, but that said, it was frankly good. <br /> <br /> My children loved this, but that is a fact, they love everything that is a caricature. The big surprise was that I liked it too, laughed out loud in some parts (even the jokes about farts), had many very creative links with the first movie and even some jokes that you had to do. I am older to understand (but not as risky as in Shrek ["do you think he is compensating something?"]). <br /> <br /> A special note about fart jokes, I was surprised to discover that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact, there were almost no noises / pictures, the references were actually quite subtle), They actually had a configuration / punchline / etc, and were almost tasteful. I would like my children to think that there is more humor to go to the bathroom, and this movie is good in those aspects. <br /> <br /> Hmm, what else? The music was regular, not as creative as in the first or second film, but very fun for the children. There are no painfully cheesy moments, which was a blessing to me. A little action, but nothing too scary (the NIMH Secret caused my children nightmares, I'm not sure that a G rating was appropriate for that ...) <br /> <br /> In general, I would say this It is a great movie for children of any age, one that is 100% safe to let them see (I try not to be too sensitive, but I had to jump and turn off the television during some movies that were less appropriate for children than expected) - But you are sure to leave the room during this. I would say that, anyway, you stay, you could find that you also enjoy it :)
