The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was modeled so close to Alan Quartermain (or at least is a character TYPE of Alan Quartermain), that the director of '85 made the mistake of plundering IJ's films for dialogue and history too deeply. What you got as a final product was a mess mixed with the name of Alan Quartermain, in an irregular space of a IJ saga imitated at low cost (with a touch of Austin Powers cheese-esquire here and there). <br /> <br /> Many critics called it "a great parody" or "unintentional comedy." Unintentional is the word. This movie was never meant to be humorous; witty, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it's witty rather than witty. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV miniseries, you get much more history, character development of your main character, solid representations and an excellent and entertaining combination. This story is a bit long; Much more than its predecessors, but deservedly, since this version has a real story and not just action and Eye Candy. Although it presents as much action as Eye Candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting IJ all together and returning to the original materials of AQ, creating a fine and well thought plot, and some nice complements. sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Now this attempt is not the big action show that is Indiana Jones. Nor is it a poor attempt to be. This vehicle is driven by the plot and the character and is a beautiful version of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed in South Africa, the audience is given beautiful (albeit desolate) views, Aboriginal SA cultures and some beautiful wildlife images to blend in perfectly with the performances and history here. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum completely surprised me with this one, since I have never been one of those who subscribed to his vision. In fact, I have disliked most of his work as a director, until this attempt. I hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the coincidence that it seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version has a rating of 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
