Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never tire of seeing. Michael Keaton has always been one of my favorites, and he's absolutely hilarious in this movie. Combining it step by step is Gedde Watanabe. The two work beautifully together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like how it shows Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) fighting in their roles as leaders of their respective groups. Both strive to keep the peace, and then finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to see). First, both are on the floor. Then Hunt jumps on a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the desk. Hunt jumps on the desk with him. The fight spills from the office to the factory. I love that, once the workers separate them, they know that they both feel bad about letting things get out of hand. In addition, there is a scene in which you can see the influence that Hunt has had on Kazihiro. He is at home and his Japanese boss arrives and says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is closed and we can not find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can not imagine Michael Keaton saying something like that. <br /> <br /> I think I really like this movie because it's really fun, and it also shows how people who are radically different can not only learn from each other, but can also become good friends.
