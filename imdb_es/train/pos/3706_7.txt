['The biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Instead of interpreting the stereotypical blond roles she usually plays, she plays an intelligent, smart and tired street character. She does not have a very important role, but she does a great job of portraying Lois Harlan as a tired, though accustomed, woman to cover her boss&#39;s indiscretions.']
