In the past, there have been countless talking animal movies, most of which feature digitally animated animal mouths to match the voice acting, or are ridiculously amateur. 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is none. <br /> <br /> This film does not need the pleasant addition for the baby of the moving canine lips or the gesticulating feline limbs. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals are speaking authentically to each other, and you can emotionally hook them to their hearts (as should all the great movies of children and dogs). <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal adventures, and features a beautiful cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (from Bruce Broughton's genius) and an impressive cast ... < br /> <br /> Michael J. Fox ... Chance <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> <br / > Frank Welker (Voice of God) ... Various <br /> <br /> It's a modernized version of the children's fiction classic 'The Incredible Journey', which became a Disney semi-documentary film a long time ago. 1963. The sequel (Lost in San Francisco) is not such a good movie, but expands the adventure of my favorite friends, and is a fun urban twist on the theme of outdoor adventure. Do you want to entertain your children with an ingenious, beautiful and moving mini-epic, without the idiotic and, often, ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy the three movies for your children, now! Thank you, Disney, for bringing me a tear every time I see this classic from the early 90's!
