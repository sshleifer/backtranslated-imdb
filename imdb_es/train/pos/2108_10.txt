A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who have an affair by mail without either of them knowing. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any mellow sentimentality away and asks his actors to offer simple and simple interpretations. As a result, you fall in love with almost all of them. <br /> <br /> There is a strong undercurrent of melancholy in this movie that I appreciated. Loneliness is an important issue, most obviously represented in the character of the owner and manager of the store, played wonderfully by Frank Morgan. He discovers that his wife is cheating him and realizes that the successful life he has created for himself is not enough to keep him from feeling alone when he does not have a partner to share. This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more touching, because both approach this invisible other, whom each considers as a kindred spirit before they meet. Of course, we know that everything will turn out well at the end, but the film does not let you forget the sad feeling you both would feel if you discovered that reality was not up to the fantasy. <br /> <Brits Lubitsch fills his film with a crackerjack cast that has lots of chemistry pots. The small group of store employees refers to themselves throughout the film as a small family, and that is exactly what we also feel. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful romance unknown. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
