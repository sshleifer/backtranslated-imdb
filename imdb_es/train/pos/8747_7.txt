* Possible Spoilers * Although it was done earlier (and better) on 'Midnight Express' and 'Return To Paradise', Brokedown Palace still moves me. <br /> <br /> Here we have the story of two young girls who travel through Thailand and be arrested on drug trafficking charges. Was it Alicia Clare Danes? Was it Darlene from Kate Beckinsale? Was it the handsome stranger they met on their trip? None of that really matters, since it is a story of friendship and trust and the limits that can be stretched. Add Bill Pullman as a half-hearted lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai girlfriend (and better lawyer than him) and we have a small story that catches the attention of the public. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary. or notorious for any reason: it is not an original concept, it does not show a sensationalist violence that leads the multitude of vanguard aspirants to talk about its "harsh realism" or "compelling truths" - it is simply a good story with some good performances. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his lazy accent and his serious way of speaking. I was pretty bored with the character. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, although decent, is nothing spectacular. She acts well, but it's not exactly a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> However, Jacqueline Kim is in good shape, creating a nice and defined character where, in reality, there is not much to work with. <Br /> <br /> But make no mistake, this is the Clare Danes movie. For a long time I have been a fan of your work, and this is not a change. She captivates in every scene that appears, and if it were not for her, the movie would probably bow at a boring rate. I particularly applaud her performance on the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
