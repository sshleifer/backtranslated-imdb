The genius of Pure Orson Welles makes this one of the best movies. Welles is involved in a murder conspiracy only to be established as the type of the fall, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment "big fool that I am". The plot is so complex that I still do not know if the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The scene of the shooting in the mirror room of the carnival is one of the most incredible ever filmed. Only that scene is worth the price of the ticket. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth played a complex but believable character. Nobody but Welles would have had the nerve to cut his hair and dye it coppery blond. Nobody should miss this photo.
