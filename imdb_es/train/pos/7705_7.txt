['Now I&#39;ve seen this about 10 times, so there must be something I like! <br /><br /> The science fiction films of the United States of the 50s were practically a mixed group: they were made intelligently and / or provoked reflection or were a cheap and ridiculous cheese. Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for the genre, the color. <br /><br /> He also had an initial advantage with the script: although Shakespeare might not have recognized him, he was based on his timeless game and, therefore, guaranteed a certain longevity if done well. <br /><br /> It is the story of the murderous identity of a man artificially magnified infinitely by machines that left a dead race on 200,000 years ago. Along the way, the plot is full of stereotypes and corn from the 50s, so pure that sometimes you wonder why you&#39;re watching it, but you always do. That love triangle thing ... yuk! The cartoon of Disney still holds up well, and the cartoon backgrounds that come out of the covers of the Galaxy magazine, etc. They look good even after 50 years. Robbie driving the car over the desert in the distance is a scream! <br /><br /> All in all, with all the flaws, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine impression survives.']
