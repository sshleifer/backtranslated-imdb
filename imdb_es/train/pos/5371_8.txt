I entered my first comment about this movie almost five years ago. So, the ideas presented in the film still seemed mostly fictional, if they could ever perspire. No more. Now, politics, society and the media in The Running Man seem to be very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year The Running Man came out) that are present today: <br /> <br /> Concern for, as the character from Richard Dawson, Damon Killian puts it, "traditional morality." CHECK <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort on the part of the participants. CHECK <br /> <br /> Cameras everywhere. VERIFY <br /> <br /> Restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with passports with barcode ("travel passes" in the film) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. CHECK <br /> <br /> An increase in the almost incestuous mix of the government and the media. CHECK <br /> <br /> Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate sequences of real movies (such as the "digital carpet" of Ben Richards' image in double). VERIFY <br /> <br /> Imprisonment of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> The economy of the flag further widens the gulf between the rich and the not-so-rich; an increasing number of marginal groups that react to the hardening of the big government rope; Civil unrest is brewing just below or on the surface of almost all important public events, regardless of their origin or intent. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> On the other hand, maybe it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novel. But just to be safe, I'm going to move to Switzerland.
