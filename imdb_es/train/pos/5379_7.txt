Many things are happening at The College Girl Murders. A mad scientist creates a poisonous gas almost undetectable. Before he can get the rewards of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a hooded and soldier monk with a whip. After a co-ed is killed in a church for gas, Scotland Yard is called to investigate, but the murder continues. Who can stop this crazy killer who seems to be able to come and go whenever he pleases in and out of college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The killer. What I do not like about a killer who sneaks in a vivid red KKK outfit, complete with red gloves. The white whip she wears and wears very effectively stands out well against the bright red dress. Although the idea of ​​a killer with a red-headed, pointed outfit lurking around a girl's school is quite unlikely, it's one of the most sinister-looking outfits I've seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s Music. I would really like to track the musical title of The College Girl Murders. It has a jazzy, hip feel, from the 60's that I loved. <br /> <br /> - Strange touches. Beyond the red dress and killer hood, the film features a sliding fireplace, a caiman pit with a cage on top, bibles with poison sprinklers, a strategically placed mannequin, miniskirts, go-go boots and hair one kilometer high I would describe it as a cross between the Batman television show of the 60s and an Italian giallo. The College Girl Murders is a true pleasure for the eyes. <br /> <br /> - The End. Let's say there are more turns than a mountain road. Just when you think the murderer has been discovered, here comes one turn and another, and another, and another. <br /> <br /> What does not work: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the guy was meant to be a comic relief, but his buffoon character has too much time on screen. <br /> <br /> - Why do they have crocodiles? Previously, I mentioned the alligators in the hole. And while they are a nice touch, they serve very little purpose. Why go through all the problems and not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plotting Plot. Some of The College Girl Murders have no flow or rhythm. There are too many moments throughout the film when things inexplicably come to a halt. A better rhythm would have made this a much more pleasant movie. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many of these German krimis, but they are some of the few I have seen (Phantom of Soho, Strangler of Blackmoor Castle, Dead Eyes of London) this may be my favorite. This has a true funky feeling that I really go into. If the plot had flowed a little better, I could have given The College Girl Murders a 7/10.
