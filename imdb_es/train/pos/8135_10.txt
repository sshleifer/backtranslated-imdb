I'm shocked Surprised and dismayed that 428 of you, IMDB users who voted before me, have not given this film a rating higher than 7. 7 ?! ?? - That's a C! If I could give FOBH a 20, I would gladly do it. This film occupies a prominent place at the top of the pantheon of modern comedy, along with Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most hilarious films of all time. If you know _not_ about rap music, YOU MUST SEE THIS !! If you do not know anything about rap music, learn something and then see this! Comparisons with 'Spinal Tap' do not appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love this. Look at it and I vote for a 10!
