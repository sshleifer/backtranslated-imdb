actually ... that "video camera" effect is just that, it's an effect, pretty good ... (you do not know much about directing a movie, right?) This movie is actually BETTER than the original, it's Very fun to watch, made for television, it is not necessary to follow any rule. I find it difficult to see number 1 because of how he kills the first girl, it is disturbing. and all the time we go so that Judd Nelson can get away with it, we, as spectators, are on his side. I hope someday we see a third cabin by the lake, but I doubt it. By watching this movie, you can understand how real movies are made, since it is like a movie inside a movie. Judd is one of the most spooky villains in history, and it's more realistic, not just cut people without thinking like other horrors.
