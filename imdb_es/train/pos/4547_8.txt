This could be a 10 if it were not for the quite predictable and Hollywood scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the main actors of our time (why can not I ask EL leader?) And the rest of the cast is at a very high level. Personally I was impressed by Hugh O 'Connor, who played Christy Brown as a child. The first scene I saw was really strong. Wow.
