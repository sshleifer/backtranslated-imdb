A good Korean film not only about Taekwondo, but what it takes to be good, like a form of thug-fighting can not beat a taekwondo in your sport because there are rules, like life and school, and this movie It has a background of this. notion. <br /> <br /> The martial arts in the movie are not so good, but they are passable and enjoyable. Friends who achieve something they would ever make fun of become stronger through the mind and heart. This movie should not be taken too seriously, as it has slapstick, but it also carries a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie again from Korea.
