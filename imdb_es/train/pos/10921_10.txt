After reading a lot of good reviews about this movie, I decided to try it (I bought it on a DVD, hence the word game "spin" ... I'm an idiot). The beginning was everything I expected, a perfect configuration (along with some quotes I heard in several Wu-Tang albums) of what should have been a good movie. But the plot I heard was so big, so predictable. Every time I saw a character (except the Lizard), I guessed what Venom was. In addition, the only great character is killed in the middle of the movie. Ok, then the plot was not very good, but at least there was a good kung-fu, right? Incorrect. The fights were very short and scanty. Of course, the different styles were great, but I would like the fights to be longer. I kept hoping to see the lizard running and doing a little crazy on the walls, but it never happened. I expected to see Centipede do a little bit of speed but it never happened. I expected to see the Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 minutes in total, but it never happened. In short, not much happens. The fight is pretty routine. Do not be fooled just because this movie has an argument, does not mean it's good.
