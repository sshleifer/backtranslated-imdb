I saw it for the first time when it was shown around the time of Easter 1993/4 and I did not think much about it, I bought it on a DVD last summer when I started to get into Michael Jackson (I used to like his music before) and now I enjoyed it plus. I'm older. It's a good movie, but it will not be this classic movie like The Sound of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard of Oz, etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good, as were the other cast members. There were disturbing scenes like the girl Katie who was slapped by the gangster Frankie Lideo, who was played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael became a robot. My favorite song in the movie was Smooth Criminal I think it was better than Thriller in my opinion.
