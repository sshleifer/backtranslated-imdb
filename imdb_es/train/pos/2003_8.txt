The main problem of the first movie of "Vampires" is that none of the characters sympathized. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time he used a nice vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire One is certainly the coolest vampire since Deacon Frost of Blade. Unfortunately, although there are some good concepts such as a restaurant scene in slow motion (why did not Carpenter use more of this?), This movie is not as good as it could have been. I expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one well-choreographed fight sequence (for example, within a city) and I was somewhat disappointed. While "The Dead" advances at a faster pace than its predecessor, it still creeps a little in some places (although it's not as bad as "Vampires" did). Like "Vampires", however, the climax of this film near the end is not very intense. <br /> <br /> Most of the above may sound like "The Dead" is a bad movie, but it definitely is not. In general it is pleasant and is among the best entries to the genre. It is not a non-original Dracula remake (like almost all other vampire movies), nor is it an unintelligent action show like Blade II. I could have just used a little more emotion. <br /> <br /> I would really like to see a third installment made by Carpenter, but it probably will not happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING the end was too predictable. One should have escaped, that would have made the movie quite unusual.
