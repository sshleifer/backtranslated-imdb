Very good Preminger movie; sometimes labyrinthine, as it explores ensembles and scenarios from different angles and perspectives as if it were a film of nature about the inhabitants of the modern city and how they live. In this sense, it is visually and spatially satisfying, since his hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into the water when he accidentally kills a man with a plate on his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews takes the lead as if she were Hamlet, and it has never been better. History can be pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight and almost elevates it to the level of tragedy. As his girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but has nothing special. Gary Merrill becomes a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth that provides a nice contrast to the coldness of Andrews; his smiling and kindly evil man seems to be continually challenging his nemesis for the simple fact that he is emotionally open, in opposition to the wounded and moralistic policeman who pursues him. <br /> <br /> There are no major surprises in this movie, which seems transient to everyone involved. For the director Preminger is a kind of meeting with his stars Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who passed their highs in their career around the time the movie was made. The supporting cast, Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand, are, understandably, most optimistic, as they were all on their way up. Preminger, as a calm observer as always, allows events to unfold without expressing a strong point of view, since the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, since the game of cat and mouse between the two antagonists seems more extensive and more archetypal than any movie. they contain, and much less resolution. <br /> <br />
