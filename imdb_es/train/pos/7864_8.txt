This is another Madhur Bhandarkar movie. I'm not sure why he has this obsession for showing the Indian film audience the moles of childhood and the concepts of g * and, but I think some of those scenes are really disgusting! What's new? It is a beautiful piece that Bhandarkar has elaborated, where it shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by the protagonist of the famous movie, Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. What makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people with whom this reporter interacts or is friends with them, such as their roommates, their colleagues, movie stars, models, rich people and other people who appear in Entertainment page # 3 in your newspaper. <br /> <br /> Remarkable: It's another good performance from Mrs. Iyer. It is likely that she will be noticed by this role. She plays selective roles but shines on them. She is remarkably de-glamorized and less beautiful in this movie. But then, entertainment journalists should not outshine the people they cover, right? Verdict: Madhur has devised another good film, which brings social issues very well to the public eye. However, this film loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Are you trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich? Or are you trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and compare it to the life of the REAL crime reporter? Are you trying to tell us how the government and the rich people govern the press? or is trying to illustrate the problems with child abuse and the people of g * y. The other concepts presented include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co-stars if they wish to enter Bollywood. <br /> <br /> Also, talk about how flight attendants get sick and get tired. of their work after a while and resort to extreme measures when marrying older people, etc. He also talks about unhappy women and spoiled children in rich families. <br /> <br /> All this was fine for me ... but it could be too complex for an average movie buff, who just wants to relieve some of the stress of daily work
