Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the moment. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally released at the time of the shuttle disaster, and that really hinders how popular it was. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, that is, on a TV ... it just seems normal. I remember this scene in the theater. It made you feel like you were really up. <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie to watch at IMAX, but I'm sure that will never happen.
