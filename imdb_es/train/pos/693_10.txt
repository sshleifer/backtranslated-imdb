This is an almost actionless movie that follows Jack, an insomnia, as he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself out of a building and, for the most part, can not distinguish reality from hallucination. br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is truly credible. Confused, scared but lethargic and sometimes without understanding what he sees, we keep trying to solve what he is seeing and find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Present a talking dog (another hallucination) and the children that suddenly appear in Jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation of how they got there (more hallucinations) and have an amazing and mind-boggling mind, 43 minutes And the shower scene is enough for any Dom fan to come back for more.
