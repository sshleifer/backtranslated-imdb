This 2004 Oscar nominee is a very short b / w movie in Spanish. A young woman goes to a cafe, drinks coffee and sees a couple of musicians standing in silence with their instruments. All clients are motionless, like mannequins. A boy, however, is quite cheerful and gets into a song about what happens at 7:35 in the morning. There is one amazing moment after another until the end that is quite, well, surprising. The people, the place, everything seems quite ordinary. And like the musical piece "Bolero", the thing continues to build up to the climax. With its structure, theme, movement and ingenuity, it is an 8-minute masterpiece.
