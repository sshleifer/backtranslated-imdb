The character of the Danes finally allows Buddy to have the horrible truth. "Leave me alone, kiss the men if you want," she yells straightly in front of everyone, thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long Good girl, this could be the place to reconsider everyone. of the smiling charm that the Danes give in this character Great reason to feel sympathy for her lying on the bed and dying, but hey, remember, there are no mistakes, except, maybe, when watching this movie. <br /> <br Wait a moment, it's an irony! This is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit, yes, but somehow, I doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind, sadly. there are some mistakes, after all.
