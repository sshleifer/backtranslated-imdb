The premise for this film is simple and so is the script: an elderly Muslim man has his teenage son take him in his similar old man's van, from France to the haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so he can fulfill his Muslim obligation before. he dies. The father is clearly a religious devotee, but the son is not impressed; accepts by obligation to his father and not to religion, prefers to be with his girlfriend (not Muslim). The father is stubborn in many things that the son does not understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often quite annoying. However, as in any good road road movie, there are strange characters found along the way; for example, a woman who is on a secondary road in Croatia who, when asked for directions to Belgrade, simply puts herself in the backseat and points out with her hand a word they assume as a place but can not find on the map. In Bulgaria, another man who is asked for instructions confirms that he can speak French, but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humor: in a country, the son gets tired of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat. They are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) he flees before the father can perform the ritual of the Muslim slaughterhouse. They finally arrive in Mecca, the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For Westerners, everything is strange but fascinating. The film is not sophisticated, but it is charming in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with a soul.
