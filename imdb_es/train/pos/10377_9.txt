A film that I expected very little, and I only saw her spend a quiet hour, but what time it turned out to be. Roll is an excellent story, although not too serious, of 'country-child-lost-in-the-great-city-makes-good', it is fun at all times, the characters are attractive and the rhythm is correct. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone is the true protagonist of the movie with his endearing interpretation of Matt, said the country boy and the local Australian football hero Rules come to the big city to try one of the great teams . John Batchelor supports him extraordinarily as the local Tiny gangster. Be careful with these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
