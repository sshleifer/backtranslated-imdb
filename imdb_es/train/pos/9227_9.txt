Post-feminist representation of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! <br /> <br /> This underestimated jewel in a movie tells the story of Flavia, a 15th-century Noble girl walled in a convent after defining her father and indeed the entire medieval Christian society by seeing a fallen Islamic warrior. as a human figure rather than demonic. <br /> <br /> Unable to accept the patriarchal government of the convent (explicitly stated in a scene where the Bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks) Flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and, facing a whole system of subjugation, repression and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but to all those around her. <br /> <br /> Presented as a piece of lack of exploitation, this is far from the truth This is a cinematographic representation of the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal domination, the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit <br /> <br /> I described it in the title of this piece as 'post-feminist' and in the end, Flavia's triumphs must always be corrupted, compromised and perverted by men. Even Flavia's dreadful ending is perpetrated by men by men (women turn around and only monks look without horror. <br /> <br /> Regarding the violence so discussed: this is a description of the effects Violence and violence, the horrors of a world driven by religious excess, having avoided violence would have limited the impact of the film, cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated into the patriarchal discourse it exhibits. of the medieval society. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted (in particular by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), with a wonderful piovani score and still challenging after all these years, Flavia is a classic of European cinema.
