I've seen this movie at least 4 times since '84 and it's still great every time I see it. It is a very convincing version of the opera Carmen, with incredible flamenco dancing, sets of bones and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This story of Carmen is a story within a story, with each one in parallel to the Other, up to the doubly tragic end. Obviously, a low-budget Spanish production, the film contains dances from some of Spain's leading flamenco dancers. The combination of opera music and the sound of dancers' boots on the wooden stage makes the storytelling even more powerful. <br /> <br /> It is the best independent film and probably my favorite all-time foreign film.
