Well, this is a very good television series from our neighboring country Turkey. It's a series about romance and love. Really very good. Here in Greece we had a similar series, but it was dramatic (I do not understand why Greek writers are trapped in this guy ... drama is not always good). To be exact I prefer that the only Turkish cause combines many good things (characters, scripts, etc.) and as a curious Greek, I would love to see the Turkish point of view ... with this, you can see the common cultural background of modern Greece . and Turkey. This TV series was really a good surprise for me. I'm a neighbor addicted! Do not forget to mention that Nehri Erdogan is the most beautiful creature in the world! I would love to see her come to Greece! Congratulations! !!! Merhaba!
